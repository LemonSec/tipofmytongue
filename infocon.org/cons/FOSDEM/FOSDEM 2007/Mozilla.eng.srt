1
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:15,140
so it's exciting to be the one saying

2
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:18,980
between you and your lunch well before

3
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:20,450
we talk about the future we should talk

4
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:22,520
a little bit about past and I promise

5
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:27,050
this won't be very long but starting

6
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:32,390
around nineteen ninety four people

7
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:35,030
remember next day one not Oh mosaic

8
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:36,890
important what's surprising about this

9
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:39,260
is much of the chrome which the buttons

10
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:40,940
around the outside content windows are

11
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:43,010
you know different icons but the same

12
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:45,500
ones as they are today it got back or

13
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:49,100
word reload home stop you've got a

14
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:50,900
property on the right let me know the

15
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:54,530
page is loaded with apps changing over

16
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:56,720
time this is an escape to it looks

17
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:58,839
really similar except the icons here is

18
00:00:58,839 --> 00:01:01,190
what you can do inside the content

19
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:03,589
window Netscape to introduce among other

20
00:01:03,589 --> 00:01:07,549
things Frank's do which is basically the

21
00:01:07,549 --> 00:01:10,700
workhorse of whips you not oh and they

22
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:13,780
just which come to know and love and

23
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:17,540
JavaScript so for netscape to did not

24
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:20,150
have in browser ability to script your

25
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:22,460
web pages just static content sitting

26
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:24,110
there wanted to do something in 2g

27
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:28,340
plugins applets do something else and in

28
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:29,960
this time the state of the art of web

29
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,690
put a little something like this this is

30
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:35,630
Yahoo circa nineteen ninety-six if you

31
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:37,430
actually look at the HTML behind this

32
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:41,960
page I use maybe five tags so you've got

33
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:44,630
to our unordered list you've got you

34
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:47,600
know hand of course the hypo leg maybe a

35
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,760
couple paragraphs I guess I live there

36
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:50,150
some

37
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:53,960
there but there's no CSS there's no

38
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,960
JavaScript there's nothing exciting this

39
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,830
is something a no new student HTML bang

40
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:02,420
on the afternoon after looking at it

41
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:05,000
before it so that's what we saw when I

42
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,179
was the state-of-the-art ten years ago

43
00:02:07,179 --> 00:02:15,880
once the safeguards that well Firefox is

44
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:19,430
at this point about 85 million users

45
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:21,830
worldwide it's about two thousand

46
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:24,050
million contributive extensions as a

47
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:26,420
friday we're up to 41 languages at an

48
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:28,970
additional for about sixteen percent

49
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:30,560
online marketer I'll talk a lot more

50
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,450
about this and thousands of people to

51
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:34,040
contribute in some way or another to the

52
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:37,610
codes either in globalization's q a dark

53
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:41,840
day or in the code itself this was a

54
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,570
present from the friends in redmond

55
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:47,950
washington on the launch of firefox to

56
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:51,740
it was a quite a tasty cake we made sure

57
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:58,340
the interns tried it first when we

58
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:00,050
blogged about a lot of people said how

59
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:00,710
did you ever see

60
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:04,660
the movies it's a trap don't you think

61
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:08,960
but it was quite good so taco bell last

62
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,970
year firefox to show in october last

63
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:13,820
year and included a number of features

64
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:15,680
that are important to how you build

65
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,780
inside the content witness features that

66
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,670
are relevant to how you don't content

67
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:22,010
for the web among them is javascript 17

68
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:22,940
and i'm going to take you through that a

69
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:25,190
lot of detail as we go it improves

70
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:27,170
performance the canvas tag also talked a

71
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:29,330
little bit canvas we introduced what

72
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:31,130
does eugenie dong store the first

73
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:33,560
location that is one of the building

74
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,910
blocks that's going to allow you to take

75
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:37,010
your web applications off the web on

76
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:39,340
your laptop and use them on an airplane

77
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:43,850
in my spell check normal web today as a

78
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:46,340
primary way of composing documents and

79
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:48,620
primary way of interacting it's

80
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:49,960
important to make sure that the browser

81
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:52,790
doesn't make you look stupid by miss

82
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:54,560
spelling bees as you type and then as

83
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,020
people use more more websites the tabs

84
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:59,030
that are part of the chrome in the top

85
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,830
of the browser become a lot more like a

86
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:02,390
workspace some things you'll have

87
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:04,520
multiple of if you lose it on a shutdown

88
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,800
or crash it is something that will ruin

89
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:10,400
your day and a lot more but I'm not here

90
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,080
to talk about individual features of

91
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,550
Firefox do I want to talk a little bit

92
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:15,380
about the web just to give you a sense

93
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,959
of kind of uptake of the Firefox this is

94
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:20,540
what the first 12 days of the firebox to

95
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:23,060
launch look like so that's about a

96
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:25,670
little over 10 million downloads in 12

97
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:28,970
days it's about two times three times

98
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:36,280
faster than the update we saw in 55

99
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,500
wondering what's different

100
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:43,090
stuff change so it's just an astounding

101
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:44,650
thing to watch is people swarm and

102
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:46,570
download the browser and then that works

103
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:49,210
out to now have the caveat anytime

104
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:51,340
anyone puts browser metrics anywhere

105
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:53,290
take them all the grain of salt they're

106
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:55,330
all imperfect measurements this one just

107
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:56,800
happens to have the prettiest pictures

108
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,840
so I'm going to show to you this is

109
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,510
worldwide market share according to 50

110
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:03,870
monitor which is a french based company

111
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:07,930
you can see Europe is a very strong

112
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:09,880
center in general for support Asia is

113
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:12,610
much weaker in general us is still

114
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:14,980
around thirteen fourteen percent you

115
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:17,290
break down Europe if you got regions

116
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:18,850
that are well more for thirty percent

117
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:20,410
some of them is breaking forty percent

118
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:23,260
adoptions others in the sixteen twenty

119
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:26,290
percent range why is this important it's

120
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:28,240
important because it means that many

121
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,630
places 161 third one fourth of the web

122
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:34,000
is using Firefox it means as we

123
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,040
introduce new features and add in the

124
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,750
work for support for advanced web

125
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:39,850
standards we're pushing the bar forward

126
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:41,800
and hopefully forcing other people to

127
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,419
come along with us and support the

128
00:05:43,419 --> 00:05:45,280
latest web standards out there to allow

129
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,780
you to build your great web applications

130
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:48,669
how many people here are web developer

131
00:05:48,669 --> 00:05:52,350
to some form of the other bride good

132
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:55,479
okay so enough of the marketing it onto

133
00:05:55,479 --> 00:05:58,030
the technical JavaScript 17 how many

134
00:05:58,030 --> 00:05:59,500
people have ever played any the

135
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:03,220
JavaScript 17 features all right okay

136
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:05,080
something calendar than Mozilla

137
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,500
community

138
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:11,530
so JavaScript 17 is a waypoint on our

139
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:13,720
way the JavaScript to JavaScript you is

140
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,100
going through the standardization

141
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,840
process it's also known as heck no

142
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:19,630
script version 4 and they're looking to

143
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:21,490
finish that work off by the middle part

144
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:23,860
of this year just rip 17 is something

145
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:25,630
that shipped in Firefox too so it's

146
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:28,570
available today you play with includes a

147
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:29,740
number of features so I'll take you

148
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:31,720
through them in great detail I guess the

149
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,890
other question is how many Python

150
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:34,600
programmer town here or at least a

151
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:37,540
cursory understanding a Python okay

152
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:39,970
you're not one so a lot of the stuff

153
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:41,560
you're going to see in JavaScript 17 a

154
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,360
lot of the things that makes JavaScript

155
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,930
17 fun ize is heavily borrowed from from

156
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:50,410
ipod so iterators generators Lennox

157
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,050
person's array comprehensions

158
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:54,430
discharging assignment I promise I'll go

159
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:55,720
through these and a little bit more

160
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,670
detail than close ellipse so let's talk

161
00:06:57,670 --> 00:06:59,800
about it so iterators again if you've

162
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,570
done python programming should look very

163
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:03,400
familiar to you construct an iterator

164
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,500
from a list of objects of some form and

165
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:06,880
then you get to walk through the day

166
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,280
trader using dot next to get the values

167
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,710
out until eventually at the end and you

168
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:14,440
get an exception generated stoppage-time

169
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,240
Cheng is generated then you can catch

170
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,440
that exception to do it tomorrow

171
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,690
obviously that's probably not normally

172
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:21,430
how you would use an iterator it's not

173
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:23,620
most useful put it on the planet but

174
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:25,420
you're more likely to use use them at

175
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:27,880
the built-in try catch that you get out

176
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,730
of a for loop so instead of initializing

177
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:32,920
the variable incrementing and checking

178
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,420
the value in your classic for loop

179
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:36,040
you're doing what people are more used

180
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,900
to these days which is basically saying

181
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:40,690
you know for food and foods do something

182
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:42,460
useful with that variable within within

183
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:45,820
that Portland generators are a little

184
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:47,650
more interesting they allow you to yield

185
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:49,570
control from within one of your

186
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:52,180
statement loss and return value back so

187
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,250
this for loop I'm yielding control back

188
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:56,350
with in passing value I my poor little

189
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:58,420
that generator will then returning

190
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:00,480
iterator which I can use together

191
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,120
to do things like this where i can use

192
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,070
my function to generate new values on

193
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:08,880
the fly and again you stop iteration so

194
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,880
these are nothing new nothing you

195
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,410
couldn't do in some form of the other in

196
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:14,880
an earlier version of JavaScript but

197
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,620
certainly make it a whole lot more fun a

198
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:20,270
lot less code lot less redundant issues

199
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:23,340
blocks so block is it was a different

200
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:24,960
way to stoke your variables it's like a

201
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,880
better tomorrow I'm going to declare

202
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:29,280
lent variables within different scopes

203
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,590
and functions goats in particular so

204
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:33,240
that value that variable is locally

205
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,520
scoped in there does not fly with any

206
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:40,020
global scope let variables have basic

207
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,760
people's go put in boiler so again you

208
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,929
can combine these structures together

209
00:08:42,929 --> 00:08:45,390
you can use iterators you can use have a

210
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:47,700
definitely local variable within a for

211
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:50,490
loop so again for your Python krogers

212
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:54,420
programmers Rane Khan granted easy way

213
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:56,550
to neutralize or gray why write a for

214
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:58,230
loop just shove a bunch of values into

215
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:00,390
an array what I can just do it in line

216
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:02,550
here so we're doing here in this case

217
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:06,210
we're generating a way of squares so

218
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:09,080
we're saying bye bye 4i County

219
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,940
using integrators there in order to

220
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:14,480
create first ten squares and then we can

221
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,120
print them out we can do on squares we

222
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,620
can do creative things like creating a

223
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:20,840
tack matrix or the diagonals under good

224
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,820
again now something you probably do on

225
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:26,770
every channel assignment but 15 on slide

226
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:29,030
all right probably one of my favorite

227
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:32,060
things researching assignment again what

228
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:34,670
I have swapping a and B variables

229
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:36,170
instead of loading it into a temp you

230
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:39,020
can basically do it in line even more

231
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:41,090
useful than that is being able to turn

232
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:43,490
multiple variables from the function so

233
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:46,100
you can in this case you know sign has

234
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,930
to be you know the output of whatever

235
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:50,750
functions is that returns it works for

236
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:54,020
objects as well works within four loops

237
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:56,390
so yeah this is where you can invite

238
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:58,700
code to say things to do slices and for

239
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:00,350
loops and iterators together so I can

240
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:04,490
say for food comma bar in blue bars then

241
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:06,230
use foo and bar within the body of my

242
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:08,420
for loop and nothing you bring program

243
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:11,120
in different ways before this it just

244
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,190
makes it a whole lot more fun lot less

245
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:16,340
code much more compact you can also do

246
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:21,710
some crazy things so Neil Nix said what

247
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:24,740
if we took the yield statement and tried

248
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:26,840
to build basically threats within

249
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,580
JavaScript you know as you know right

250
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:30,950
now the JavaScript runtime is filtering

251
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:33,650
the browser's is it's a single thread so

252
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:35,270
what you can do is use a technique

253
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:36,680
called trampolining which is basically

254
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:39,440
like cooperative multitasking you can

255
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,420
basically pass control back to your

256
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:44,150
parent thread and build effectively a

257
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:46,010
thread library and what's interesting

258
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:47,630
about this is not that you actually want

259
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:49,790
to do this real life what's interesting

260
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:52,880
about it is by building on the basic

261
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,140
features of generators with in

262
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:57,260
JavaScript you can generate something

263
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:59,590
like this in in this case for code

264
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:01,480
versus the 90k coding used to taking

265
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:06,460
before to do this so that's jazz 17 and

266
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:07,150
I'm going to talk a little about

267
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:09,790
JavaScript to towards towards the end I

268
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:11,860
think the other exciting thing I get

269
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:13,390
into all things you can do today is

270
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:15,640
canvas unfortunately we had some ad

271
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,830
issue so I can't show you the demos how

272
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:19,240
many people have seen the Walker demo

273
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:23,140
Kevin's okay for those of you can it

274
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:24,940
looks just like this and it looks like

275
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:27,310
doom you know circa nineteen ninety-four

276
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:30,460
maybe but Wolfenstein greediest public

277
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:32,050
loves our pathways the darkness for you

278
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:36,310
Mac fans whole bunch of game but you

279
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:37,960
know let you run around amazed is

280
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,850
texture it's all running string them in

281
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:42,070
the browser you're not downloading a

282
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:44,440
java applet or anything like that and

283
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:47,050
it's using the canvas tag demos tag is a

284
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:49,840
tag started by Apple and then picked up

285
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:53,470
by us and opera and put into the one WG

286
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:55,510
Borden group in order to standardize

287
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:58,000
allows you to draw videos within a div

288
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,640
or other element within your when I HTML

289
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,650
page so if you've ever done treating

290
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:05,530
programming of any line move to Mari to

291
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:08,440
philz coffee wedges all the basics were

292
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,210
there you can build really powerful

293
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:12,970
things it's not just for toy demos if

294
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:15,130
you've seen yahoo place so this launched

295
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:17,920
two or three weeks ago it's a way to

296
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,530
kind of wide mix up data from the web so

297
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:23,560
i can grab one URL grab from another you

298
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,330
know put them together summarize and

299
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:27,130
generate for example a new RSS feed

300
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:28,960
because there's really killer editor

301
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:31,570
which lets you drag around the boxes to

302
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:33,850
adjust where the input 1 workflow

303
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:36,310
effectively goes into the output of

304
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:38,800
another and this is all done on top of

305
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,710
canvas so again fire my browser pointed

306
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:43,690
up there i could drag down that's around

307
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:46,240
to load any plugins allows you to build

308
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,370
what you'd expect on the desktop which

309
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:52,420
is a really rich web application so

310
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:53,950
that's what you can do today with

311
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:55,990
today's technologies so what are we

312
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:58,960
going next I'm going to talk about four

313
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,340
different things in terms of where we're

314
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:02,050
going next first in terms of JavaScript

315
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:03,940
itself talk a little bit about js2

316
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:07,360
javascript to talk about the basic

317
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,920
building blocks required to take web

318
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:11,080
applications offline so this means what

319
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,250
you can do to take your web application

320
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:14,940
disconnect from the net and still use it

321
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:17,110
talk a little bit about market formats

322
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:19,480
and talk for about a second about what

323
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:23,530
we're doing web tooling so JavaScript to

324
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:26,290
I there's two very common answers

325
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:27,880
questions that Brandon and other folks

326
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:30,190
are deeply involved in JavaScript to get

327
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:33,640
past the first one is why the heck are

328
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:35,950
you touching the JavaScript language all

329
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:38,170
around we can't seem to agree today and

330
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:40,150
how to implement it why we're creating

331
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:41,770
this whole new standard and this major

332
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:43,870
radical language and i think if you look

333
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:45,640
as I take you through kind of some of

334
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,920
the goals of JavaScript you it really is

335
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,870
about taking the web forward and taking

336
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,970
us out of the blink tag and on a route

337
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:54,160
list from you know the early 90s and

338
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,470
into these entire office suites and web

339
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:58,780
applications on the web and so what

340
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:00,970
we're trying to do is number one fix the

341
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:02,320
problems that people been griping about

342
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,170
for 10 12 years using javascript the

343
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:07,390
number to really support programming the

344
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:09,310
large this means lots of people

345
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:11,080
collaborating together to build web

346
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,450
applications and doing so novel luggage

347
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:16,960
nanigans along the way so take you

348
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,280
through a tour of some of the big parts

349
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:22,420
of javascript do first is typing so

350
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:24,790
JavaScript isn't it is now it's mostly

351
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:27,040
well you know untyped language well

352
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,450
we're adding a javascript you is the

353
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:30,880
ability to do type annotations I'll talk

354
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,530
about this a little bit and we're going

355
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:36,460
to get better in various at one time to

356
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:38,320
make sure that you can program them

357
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,150
make sure you write functions that

358
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:41,680
expect certain values and it's checked

359
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,360
by the system rather than check by you

360
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,280
in order to allow you to build

361
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,170
applications that are big and suitable

362
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:48,940
for the web and a game spaces and

363
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:50,920
packages and some of the features I

364
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:53,560
talked about in JavaScript 17 already

365
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,360
implemented in terms of instruction

366
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,730
assignment iterative generators I didn't

367
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,320
talk about operator functions as a part

368
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,720
of jives too and some improvements to

369
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:04,300
the basic objects so I said the first

370
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:06,400
question was why the heck are you doing

371
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,680
Jay is to in the first place the second

372
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:11,170
question is oh my god jst looks really

373
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:13,630
big did you take on too much work why

374
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:14,800
are you doing this big language crowd

375
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,170
and I think a couple of things happen if

376
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:18,730
you can tease apart everything I'm about

377
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:20,950
to talk about here it really boils down

378
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:23,590
to two to two or three amazing things

379
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,780
the first is the introduction of pipes

380
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:27,820
into the JavaScript language and filming

381
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:30,070
a sound and formal type system that's

382
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:31,390
not something you want to do kind of

383
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:33,100
piece by piece something you have to do

384
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,800
basically one whole shot the second is

385
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,810
really to just fix up some of these

386
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:39,820
problems in a play javascript for a long

387
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:42,640
time and the third is to add a lot of

388
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,140
the syntactic sugar a lot of the

389
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:46,780
niceties around here and generators let

390
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:49,900
you build these web applications so let

391
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:52,000
me take you quickly through some of the

392
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,060
basics of types so types first of all up

393
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:56,680
again it's type annotation which means

394
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,240
it's optional typing you can still

395
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,890
program the same way you did JavaScript

396
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:01,720
you're just not using types to your

397
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,460
variables but if you choose to you can

398
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:05,380
declare variables the types you can

399
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:08,350
write function signatures that request

400
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:10,030
certain types on them so in this case

401
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:11,740
we're saying writing function which

402
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:13,390
takes an interest ranking a generic

403
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:17,670
object you can do multiple parametrize

404
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:20,050
values passed a note function so you're

405
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:21,940
not fixed to a single prototype you can

406
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:24,430
have basically a set of pics variables

407
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:26,200
plus whatever else and people can pass

408
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,300
in different amounts of arguments and

409
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:31,330
send that isn't a range if you use Java

410
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:33,850
generics or if you've used chem blinks

411
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:37,000
and C++ you can build parametric lists

412
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,010
entire mental type C JavaScript as well

413
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:41,050
today we construct a list of only

414
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:46,990
Nike or type food whatever maybe you can

415
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:49,180
also use structural type so if you don't

416
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:50,350
wanna build glasses you just want to

417
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:52,029
build strokes the groups of objects

418
00:16:52,029 --> 00:16:55,120
together that are used in them I think

419
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,980
more interesting exciting is the use of

420
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:58,750
classes so this is again going to look

421
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,700
very familiar if you've done organ da

422
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:02,980
boom it's done work and pipe on any of

423
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,900
these other languages you see ways to

424
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,490
encapsulate pulled data and

425
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:08,800
functionality into structured objects

426
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:11,859
called glasses glasses look a lot like

427
00:17:11,859 --> 00:17:14,140
classes do a job on my way you can drive

428
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:16,179
a classroom and other plans like II

429
00:17:16,179 --> 00:17:18,699
molded sealed against vacation it looks

430
00:17:18,699 --> 00:17:20,099
a little bit something like this I

431
00:17:20,099 --> 00:17:23,589
extend another class I have a set of

432
00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:24,520
function declarations and

433
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,260
implementations there and I can just

434
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:27,849
construct it just like I would do with

435
00:17:27,849 --> 00:17:31,929
any other language interfaces interfaces

436
00:17:31,929 --> 00:17:33,490
or like glasses except there's no

437
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:35,800
implementation the key difference very

438
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:38,650
similar pajama again is that any class

439
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:40,480
that will extend one of the class but

440
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,700
can implement multiple interfaces so the

441
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:43,960
interface you're trying to find a

442
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,550
contract you're not defining any

443
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:48,460
publication how this actually works and

444
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:50,290
so again you see something looks a

445
00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:51,940
little something like this I think my

446
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:53,470
name okay which is simply a set up

447
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:55,809
effectively method signatures and i have

448
00:17:55,809 --> 00:17:57,940
a class or multiple classes in many

449
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:59,470
cases which would everything like that

450
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:04,780
happens you can use structural types as

451
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:07,120
well so you can declare types was just

452
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,640
either a function or a series of data

453
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:12,160
members with no amor tation so that's

454
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,720
the basics of closets or whatever that

455
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:16,360
really quickly but if you use many of

456
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,400
the modern programming languages and use

457
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,200
object orientation allow you to populate

458
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,300
your functionality your data into one

459
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:23,890
object that's effectively what we're

460
00:18:23,890 --> 00:18:26,080
doing here again maybe a familiar for

461
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,120
people making it fun make it easy to

462
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:30,160
build larger system is within javascript

463
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,840
that run on the web without any

464
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:32,720
installation of the

465
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,720
software the other key part of this is

466
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:39,110
namespaces so if you build glasses

467
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:40,220
you're going to want to make sure that

468
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:41,960
you can have certain parts of those

469
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,370
glasses that are exposed to other

470
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:45,320
classes and serve parts that are private

471
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:47,390
parts of the implementation so in this

472
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:49,580
case we can declare public private and

473
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:53,918
internal habilitation and this is on a

474
00:18:55,360 --> 00:19:00,470
per class basis so and then in spaces

475
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:02,150
are used fairly generically they can use

476
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:04,250
mold to namespace entire package systems

477
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:06,650
so in this case I'm saying in class c

478
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:09,230
function is in the improved namespace

479
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:12,020
and i can basically call the namespace

480
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:13,610
directly by qualifying it while i'm

481
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:16,070
calling it or i can import an entire

482
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:18,200
namespace and then i can use a shorthand

483
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,179
without having to to fully fall by the

484
00:19:20,179 --> 00:19:22,789
namespace that's up going this is we

485
00:19:22,789 --> 00:19:25,789
used to build packages so if i want to

486
00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:28,460
create for example like or lengthen

487
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:30,169
package and implement a series of things

488
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:32,299
in there that i have different ways just

489
00:19:32,299 --> 00:19:33,740
like you can import packages other

490
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:36,049
languages to import an entire package or

491
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:38,929
select Lamport individual classics again

492
00:19:38,929 --> 00:19:40,970
this is super important mostly for when

493
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:42,380
you're building huge systems i'm going

494
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:43,820
to take a up and different march the

495
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:45,559
left different people implementing it

496
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:47,299
you don't want to pollute the global

497
00:19:47,299 --> 00:19:48,770
namespace you know when it flashes of

498
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:50,929
classes and variables allowing props

499
00:19:50,929 --> 00:19:52,159
like what you're doing and make sure

500
00:19:52,159 --> 00:19:53,570
that you're safe from other

501
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:56,450
implementation decimals and only bring

502
00:19:56,450 --> 00:19:58,360
this up because this is one of the most

503
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,860
duplicated by to Lucilla which is why

504
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:04,909
the heck is 7.4 9-30 5.99 equal to that

505
00:20:04,909 --> 00:20:07,340
number so there's a new decimal type

506
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:09,049
that will be implemented there's a long

507
00:20:09,049 --> 00:20:11,059
number of other small features in

508
00:20:11,059 --> 00:20:12,289
JavaScript that I'm not going to go over

509
00:20:12,289 --> 00:20:14,419
now that improve a lot of these sorts of

510
00:20:14,419 --> 00:20:16,520
issues people issues that people have to

511
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:17,980
bang them heads on over

512
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:19,960
over again and fix and work around in

513
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:22,150
the browser and this is coming real soon

514
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:24,429
now as I said the suspect is being

515
00:20:24,429 --> 00:20:27,370
worked on now will be done around second

516
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:29,559
quarter of this year and what's also

517
00:20:29,559 --> 00:20:30,790
different about this version of

518
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:31,900
javascript is there's a reference

519
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:33,370
implementation being developed in

520
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:35,620
parallel and mmm so it means it's not

521
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:37,809
just a wikia word doc watch I have a

522
00:20:37,809 --> 00:20:39,610
working lining reference implementation

523
00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:41,590
that all the browser vendors can compare

524
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:43,270
their implementations against to make

525
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:45,610
sure we're getting a better shot at evil

526
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:46,840
behavior across all the different

527
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,000
platforms the other exciting

528
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,860
announcement that you may have seen is

529
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:52,950
that the Dobby has decided to donate

530
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:56,530
just-in-time compiler for action script

531
00:20:56,530 --> 00:20:58,540
/ JavaScript hold that we're not going

532
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:00,100
to cameron project to the announced this

533
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:02,530
in the fall and that would be integrated

534
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:04,660
into a future version of firefox so it's

535
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:06,280
going to allow us extremely high

536
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,660
performance JavaScript on the web

537
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:10,090
just-in-time compilers obviously the you

538
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:12,580
know a way to get virtual machines to

539
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:14,559
perform extremely well the other thing

540
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:16,150
to note is that this is probably the

541
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:18,610
last Big Bang grab we're going to do of

542
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:21,549
jas a long time realize it it's not like

543
00:21:21,549 --> 00:21:22,870
all browsers we're going to adopt this

544
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:24,520
overnight sound like all the websites

545
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:25,630
are going to do it is going to be a slow

546
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:27,669
adoption but once we get there we're

547
00:21:27,669 --> 00:21:29,830
going to have technology sitting on your

548
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:31,960
desktop on you know ninety ninety-five

549
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,910
percent of people's desktop that allow

550
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:35,440
you to build these big rich applications

551
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,210
without installing any additional

552
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:45,360
software so that's JX jazz to them yes

553
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:48,850
yes don't read that word it's spelled

554
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:52,419
wrong Thank You Axl all right how does

555
00:21:52,419 --> 00:21:54,809
this change

556
00:21:58,290 --> 00:22:04,560
kind of doesn't yeah kind of a restart

557
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:09,570
all right I just wear the other browser

558
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:12,010
implementations intense as a full name

559
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:15,580
JS too yeah it's a good question there

560
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:17,260
are other browser vendors participate

561
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:19,060
agri script isn't open standards group

562
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:20,590
so there are many other people

563
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:23,890
participating in this standards firefox

564
00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:26,170
well the furthest ahead javascript 17 is

565
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:29,230
kind of a halfway point to j SQ no one

566
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:31,930
else currently has 17 implemented we

567
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:33,520
probably won't have data simple method

568
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:37,300
until sometime 2008 it will probably be

569
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:39,400
the first since we're heavily involved

570
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,410
in there so you would expect you this is

571
00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:42,790
something that's coming over the next

572
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:44,530
couple of years not something you're

573
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:45,880
going to see this year across major

574
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:49,060
browsers as I can't speak for anyone i

575
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:51,160
hope everyone I hope they hit the night

576
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:54,160
but I never knew all right enough

577
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,960
JavaScript let's talk about how fun web

578
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:58,360
apps so does everyone get the basic

579
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:59,890
concept that will mean when we say

580
00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:02,560
offline without so means i'm reading

581
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:05,170
gmail looking through my mail either

582
00:23:05,170 --> 00:23:06,970
have you know just connect my laptop

583
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:10,360
going an airplane Wi-Fi is bad no reason

584
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:12,160
why I shouldn't be able to read all the

585
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,660
messages have already downloaded just

586
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:16,120
like any desktop application that allows

587
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,560
you to look at what's on your desktop

588
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:20,140
without having a connect so what we're

589
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:22,120
doing is building the basic building

590
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:24,400
blocks that any web application can use

591
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,400
to take themselves off line so offline

592
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:30,610
really poses a three main parts first

593
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:32,320
thing I've got to do they got to be able

594
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,870
to access and stored data offline so if

595
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:37,030
I'm building an offline email client I

596
00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:38,710
have to be able to take my messages my

597
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:39,280
email message

598
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,470
headers and shove them somewhere on the

599
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:43,300
disk and be able to access them when I'm

600
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:45,130
not connected to the net and so that's

601
00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:47,830
implemented via 1wg which is working

602
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:50,350
groups and formal standards body dong

603
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:51,730
storage and that's already partially

604
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:54,640
implemented in firefox to the second

605
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,290
thing i need to do so if i could store

606
00:23:56,290 --> 00:23:58,210
my data offline I need to be able to

607
00:23:58,210 --> 00:24:00,730
store coded in other resources so about

608
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:02,200
JavaScript or just going to run in the

609
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,660
browser on my offline application got

610
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:07,000
CSS files we've got images about other

611
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,710
things I need to make sure I can get to

612
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:10,150
that stuff without having to download it

613
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:11,440
over the net because I don't have a net

614
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,810
connection and so that's what well we've

615
00:24:13,810 --> 00:24:15,460
had offline catch which I'll talk a

616
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:17,350
little bit about and then the last thing

617
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:18,970
obviously shop needs to know whether

618
00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:20,980
it's online or offline so they can

619
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:22,690
behave properly leasing when it comes

620
00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:24,850
back online it can make sure to not make

621
00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:27,130
Nevel request when it's off and so we've

622
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:28,870
added online and offline event so let me

623
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:30,400
take the pretty titties Dom session

624
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,380
storage John efficient storage you can

625
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:34,270
pick them basically it's a big hash

626
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:36,400
table on the local disk that is

627
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,770
associated with your session so it goes

628
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:41,200
away the browser is explicitly close it

629
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,930
stays around if it crashes or something

630
00:24:43,930 --> 00:24:46,030
else happens and you can use it to

631
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:47,710
basically fetch any string value you

632
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:49,750
want so in this case I'm just shuffling

633
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:52,180
the value of the checkbox on my web page

634
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:55,300
into my dog session storage under a

635
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:57,880
variable name insurance and then I can

636
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:00,100
go back and I can Corey the value of

637
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:01,600
that variable later on with in one

638
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,820
session even more interesting probably

639
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:06,220
its global storage so it's the same

640
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:08,290
thing it's a hash table that i can use

641
00:25:08,290 --> 00:25:11,230
store values except that it's a per

642
00:25:11,230 --> 00:25:14,560
domain value and it's persistent so i

643
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:16,120
can store value shut down my browser

644
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:17,650
restart my computer stuff my browser

645
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:20,080
back up pull an IE back out without ever

646
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,940
go back to the network and so this is

647
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:23,200
one of the basic building blocks of

648
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,640
building these wetbacks web-based

649
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,950
applications security is obviously

650
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:29,890
important issue in one sites to be able

651
00:25:29,890 --> 00:25:32,549
to securely store the data there so

652
00:25:32,549 --> 00:25:35,019
domains can access some domains and vice

653
00:25:35,019 --> 00:25:37,269
versa so you can build a series of cured

654
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:39,159
sites that can share data across from

655
00:25:39,159 --> 00:25:41,799
the big one but we don't allow across to

656
00:25:41,799 --> 00:25:44,350
make sure so obviously doubled up to

657
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:46,690
example can't hit dump the dump example

658
00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:48,850
to the site all of this is specified in

659
00:25:48,850 --> 00:25:50,279
the West WG working groups

660
00:25:50,279 --> 00:25:52,779
specifications much of its implemented

661
00:25:52,779 --> 00:25:54,880
firefox to again we hope other browsers

662
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,440
will continue implementing and we'll

663
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:58,120
finish the implementation at bar box 3

664
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:00,940
the last part of the school puzzle is

665
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:04,330
the offline cash and that's this

666
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:07,169
complicated as a guest it's a link rel I

667
00:26:07,169 --> 00:26:09,970
basically tag right resource and I'm

668
00:26:09,970 --> 00:26:13,299
saying you know Jason jas until you got

669
00:26:13,299 --> 00:26:15,639
HTML I want you to pin them in the couch

670
00:26:15,639 --> 00:26:18,399
so that when I go offline I can make

671
00:26:18,399 --> 00:26:20,529
sure I can access those resources make

672
00:26:20,529 --> 00:26:22,539
sure that my HTML is there a CSS

673
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:24,880
JavaScript whatever maybe by simply

674
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,730
adding these additional metadata on your

675
00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:30,279
web page we will make sure to pin it

676
00:26:30,279 --> 00:26:31,510
into the cache and make sure it's

677
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:33,789
available for you to sign and this works

678
00:26:33,789 --> 00:26:59,230
on the latest nightly builds of hey you

679
00:26:59,230 --> 00:27:00,850
know what the hook your cash money we

680
00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:05,860
don't know a lot yeah it's bad that'll

681
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:10,240
be bad it don't visit the site this is

682
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,039
the future so we don't know it all yes I

683
00:27:12,039 --> 00:27:13,899
knew it i've been fighting stock market

684
00:27:13,899 --> 00:27:17,710
not you're talking to you not to but but

685
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:19,450
there's lots of things that work out and

686
00:27:19,450 --> 00:27:20,860
this is you know happening in real time

687
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:22,720
in terms of doing it we just we just

688
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:26,889
started getting this going last thing is

689
00:27:26,889 --> 00:27:28,299
online offline events this is really

690
00:27:28,299 --> 00:27:30,700
simple it's basically how does your code

691
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:32,649
how does your application know whether

692
00:27:32,649 --> 00:27:34,360
it's on the net or not and it starts

693
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:36,669
with a navigator online property which i

694
00:27:36,669 --> 00:27:39,370
think i should already existed which

695
00:27:39,370 --> 00:27:41,649
allows you to just query real time am i

696
00:27:41,649 --> 00:27:43,270
online if said well I should probably

697
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:45,730
shut with my data to the server him or

698
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:47,470
not online maybe I should shuffle with

699
00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:49,000
the local storage and deal with it there

700
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,090
and equally as important rather than

701
00:27:52,090 --> 00:27:53,590
checking in a loop what's going on

702
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:55,480
there's a new series of events going

703
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:58,480
online and gone offline or offline and

704
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,340
online really is what they are you can

705
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:02,289
register event handlers for to be

706
00:28:02,289 --> 00:28:04,960
notified when you're out goes offline so

707
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,850
in other words if I don't want to wait

708
00:28:06,850 --> 00:28:08,649
and notify want to go online and

709
00:28:08,649 --> 00:28:10,149
automatically sync my data back up to

710
00:28:10,149 --> 00:28:12,580
the server I can do that quite easily by

711
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:14,230
registering an event handler just like

712
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:17,610
you did would do anywhere else

713
00:28:24,429 --> 00:28:26,390
there's a little preview the future

714
00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:29,059
there all right so as I said

715
00:28:29,059 --> 00:28:30,380
unfortunately I can't show you the demo

716
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:32,600
but because i have it on the only

717
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:35,150
machine here but it turns out to be with

718
00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:36,590
these three building blocks relatively

719
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:38,420
trivial to build applications we've got

720
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:41,090
a couple of sample applications blunders

721
00:28:41,090 --> 00:28:43,490
justit to do is that allows me to store

722
00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:45,410
lunchy data locally and the other is

723
00:28:45,410 --> 00:28:48,230
sort of a company an open source project

724
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:51,830
called zimbra it's a male calendaring

725
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:55,040
basically server that has an open-source

726
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,480
edition of kind of like a microsoft

727
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,390
exchange competitor but all open-source

728
00:28:58,390 --> 00:29:00,590
someone from the missoula project spent

729
00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:03,920
about five six eight took the source

730
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,929
code and made it pulling off line the

731
00:29:05,929 --> 00:29:07,940
paddle so you can compose emails offline

732
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:10,700
drag them around folders when you get

733
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:12,020
back onto the server you can go into the

734
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:14,179
sent box inside them out so this is not

735
00:29:14,179 --> 00:29:15,890
something that requires people to

736
00:29:15,890 --> 00:29:17,270
completely wear protective web

737
00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:18,980
applications to download a new stop to

738
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:20,720
program in a different language it's

739
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,250
literally just take your application

740
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:24,920
make sure the resources are organized in

741
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:27,260
ways that we can pin to the cash make

742
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:28,309
sure you know when you're online and

743
00:29:28,309 --> 00:29:31,309
offline and store data offline so as

744
00:29:31,309 --> 00:29:32,540
this gets implemented we're going to see

745
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:34,280
probably a lot more applications do this

746
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:36,260
very very quickly which also dec use

747
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:41,120
cases read email RSS feeds even Google

748
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,710
Docs and spreadsheets being able to take

749
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:44,570
a doc offline read it on the plane

750
00:29:44,570 --> 00:29:46,309
without having to explicitly downloading

751
00:29:46,309 --> 00:29:52,130
beforehand so that's offline second part

752
00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:54,340
of the future of the web the third part

753
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:59,150
microformats so people are known to

754
00:29:59,150 --> 00:30:04,280
microformats okay

755
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:11,450
no one can say no right the Micra format

756
00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:13,250
basic idea is pretty simple it's just

757
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:15,290
there's a lot of unstructured data on

758
00:30:15,290 --> 00:30:18,410
the web I gotta hear my page and looking

759
00:30:18,410 --> 00:30:20,780
to order a pizza or bronze and dinner

760
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:22,760
I'm going to say a phone number but it's

761
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:24,380
an address containing email address

762
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:25,760
right I'm going to want to do useful

763
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,170
things with that I'm going to call its

764
00:30:27,170 --> 00:30:28,700
own number may want to shuffle the

765
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:30,470
address away in my address book so I can

766
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:32,510
do something useful later I may want to

767
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:34,730
add an event that's got a date on it my

768
00:30:34,730 --> 00:30:36,200
counter is it something I'm going to go

769
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:38,840
through and today what you do is is you

770
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:41,000
use yellow d so i'm going to green

771
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,380
screen cut and paste where I've kind of

772
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:44,660
cut and paige grab a tax drop it

773
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:46,340
somewhere else maybe reformat it hope

774
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:48,110
that it works so the basics of

775
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:49,850
microformats are hey we code a little

776
00:30:49,850 --> 00:30:51,830
bit more data in there to let you know

777
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:54,410
that this is an address or this is a

778
00:30:54,410 --> 00:30:57,200
date time or this is a phone number you

779
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,490
can start to build clients that do

780
00:30:58,490 --> 00:31:00,740
intelligent things that information so

781
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:03,140
we've already built a micro-cap we built

782
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:05,450
an extension pole operator which is

783
00:31:05,450 --> 00:31:07,340
available to download down firefox and

784
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:09,560
what it basically does is it looks for

785
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:11,930
content on your web page or tries to do

786
00:31:11,930 --> 00:31:13,760
useful things with it so in this case

787
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:16,040
it's go to yahoo local you look for an

788
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,440
address for pizza you know piece of

789
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:20,480
delivery or a restaurant instead of

790
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,610
again manually honey basing that you'll

791
00:31:22,610 --> 00:31:24,590
see in the upper left but it's found

792
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:26,020
this information you

793
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:28,240
just contact and export it directly into

794
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,940
your contacts toward your toes range

795
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:33,400
carnby card system of choice and so if

796
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,720
you're on a Mac it will take it to jam

797
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,950
it into the address book and now you've

798
00:31:35,950 --> 00:31:37,840
got the address and phone number jig

799
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:40,060
column and do something useful and so

800
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:41,680
the basics of microformats that we're

801
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,480
looking at trying to future versions of

802
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:46,090
Firefox and hopefully on the web is to

803
00:31:46,090 --> 00:31:47,920
build the basic building blocks so that

804
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,990
makes it really easy for web authors for

805
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:52,060
extension authors and other people to

806
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:53,890
expand this end of microformats it's not

807
00:31:53,890 --> 00:31:55,450
going to be a set of things that we ship

808
00:31:55,450 --> 00:31:58,150
in the browser rather ways to discover

809
00:31:58,150 --> 00:31:59,920
that you got content on the page a

810
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:02,290
unified way and notify people the hey

811
00:32:02,290 --> 00:32:03,670
there's something on this page you can

812
00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:05,920
do you can act with this is a toolbar as

813
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,600
a prototype implementation it's

814
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:08,980
certainly not done you can imagine

815
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:11,230
hovering over the address with a little

816
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:12,700
sticky pop-up or whatever it may be

817
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:14,320
we're going to build the basic building

818
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,000
blocks to make a trivial for someone to

819
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,220
say here's a new content type here's a

820
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:19,690
quick parser for it here's what you do

821
00:32:19,690 --> 00:32:21,280
with the data and plug that into the

822
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:23,560
browser so that's more doing

823
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:26,050
microformats and the last thing is

824
00:32:26,050 --> 00:32:27,820
another demo of course I some other time

825
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:30,370
I'll show you it's pretty sweet last

826
00:32:30,370 --> 00:32:31,780
thing everyone here who's done

827
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:33,160
developmental the web is probably seeing

828
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:35,020
Firebug Firebug it's pretty awesome

829
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:37,840
Firebug is an extension for Firefox it's

830
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,310
basically everything you've always

831
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:42,670
wanted in a javascript / CSS / HTML

832
00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:46,000
debugger and more and I think what's

833
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,310
important about this is when you think

834
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:49,330
about what we're trying to do with the

835
00:32:49,330 --> 00:32:50,980
future of the web we're trying to make

836
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:53,320
it possible and we're trying to make it

837
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:56,200
fun because for a lot of us programming

838
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:58,180
isn't just like a job so we would do it

839
00:32:58,180 --> 00:33:00,010
something that's fun and interesting to

840
00:33:00,010 --> 00:33:02,350
us and so aesthetics matter you know

841
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:03,820
banging my head against the wall a

842
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:05,230
problem that I know there's a better way

843
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:06,850
to deal isn't something I'm going to

844
00:33:06,850 --> 00:33:09,010
keep doing after a while the Firebug is

845
00:33:09,010 --> 00:33:10,180
one of these things that makes

846
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:12,100
development fun you can twiddle the CSS

847
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:14,320
you can get timings to figure out

848
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,760
exactly which part of your script is

849
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,190
running slow you can watch HTTP requests

850
00:33:18,190 --> 00:33:20,320
go by figure out which things are

851
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,330
hitting the server when and where and so

852
00:33:22,330 --> 00:33:23,890
this is the beginning of trying to bring

853
00:33:23,890 --> 00:33:26,830
tooling on the web up to par with what

854
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:27,420
you've seen

855
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:29,430
applications to make sure that it's not

856
00:33:29,430 --> 00:33:31,500
just a text editor and the JavaScript

857
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:33,090
console or the only weapons you have a

858
00:33:33,090 --> 00:33:34,260
choice when you're building web

859
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:36,180
applications but making sure you have a

860
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:37,830
totally rich full set to fill these

861
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:41,130
things so again what is all of this

862
00:33:41,130 --> 00:33:44,010
stuff so I hear me ramble on about high

863
00:33:44,010 --> 00:33:45,840
paying about iterators and generators

864
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:48,930
all this gobbledygook and jas but at the

865
00:33:48,930 --> 00:33:50,490
end of the day what we're trying to do

866
00:33:50,490 --> 00:33:52,530
is make it so big teams of people

867
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:54,990
collaborate or small in the world and

868
00:33:54,990 --> 00:33:56,910
get together and build the next

869
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:58,980
generation of web applications things

870
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:00,540
that we couldn't even think of today on

871
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:03,750
the web I want to make it fun but I make

872
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:05,790
it aesthetically pleasing we want you to

873
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:07,800
sit down develop something the legs it

874
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,480
oh that's cool look I can just do this

875
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,650
kind of thing this iterator thing

876
00:34:10,650 --> 00:34:11,730
instead of writing all of this code

877
00:34:11,730 --> 00:34:13,560
because then you'll do more but that's

878
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:15,750
what really motivates people we're

879
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:17,040
trying to make the web indistinguishable

880
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:19,739
from the desktop what I mean by that is

881
00:34:19,739 --> 00:34:21,300
there isn't anything you should be able

882
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:23,760
to do on a desktop application but you

883
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:24,989
shouldn't also be able to do on web

884
00:34:24,989 --> 00:34:27,630
application if you think about what the

885
00:34:27,630 --> 00:34:29,489
few things are that are that case right

886
00:34:29,489 --> 00:34:31,080
now we're going to take care of them

887
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:33,060
this year so the first thing is offline

888
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:35,429
again I can't sync my data offline we're

889
00:34:35,429 --> 00:34:37,020
going to fix that we're going to doing a

890
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:38,668
standard reply way so that people come

891
00:34:38,668 --> 00:34:40,469
along and make it so that you can take

892
00:34:40,469 --> 00:34:41,850
your web applications with you on the

893
00:34:41,850 --> 00:34:44,040
road graphics is another big area

894
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,560
they're saying a lot of eye candy and

895
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,540
desktop applications and the web is

896
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:50,250
slowly catching up there when you're

897
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:51,960
starting to see things like better SVG

898
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,760
of limitations and all the browsers and

899
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,949
the canvas tag that allow you to again

900
00:34:55,949 --> 00:34:58,380
do these rich products that are just

901
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:00,180
ways that allow you to build graph

902
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:02,310
editors and other projects so going to

903
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:04,099
see that that those kind of things

904
00:35:04,099 --> 00:35:06,200
done and then the last color is

905
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:10,130
performance so by increasing the

906
00:35:10,130 --> 00:35:12,380
performance of the JavaScript engine and

907
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:13,880
the scalability of the JavaScript engine

908
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,739
through a just-in-time compiler in the

909
00:35:15,739 --> 00:35:17,809
future going to be able to build even

910
00:35:17,809 --> 00:35:19,989
bigger web applications in the pen bay

911
00:35:19,989 --> 00:35:23,569
and again much of this is here now much

912
00:35:23,569 --> 00:35:25,130
of this you can play with either an

913
00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:26,869
existing versions of Firefox or future

914
00:35:26,869 --> 00:35:28,970
versions budget is specified you to

915
00:35:28,970 --> 00:35:30,559
necto working group for the what WG

916
00:35:30,559 --> 00:35:32,660
documents so never want to test their

917
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:35,269
communication to make sure it looks so

918
00:35:35,269 --> 00:35:37,430
that's the future of the web and I know

919
00:35:37,430 --> 00:35:41,169
it because aliens told me about

920
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:52,660
questions stun you into silence

921
00:35:57,250 --> 00:36:00,250
right

922
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:07,200
yeah I'm not I don't know the answer

923
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:11,100
that it's a short answer so probably not

924
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:12,900
the caching system doesn't store in a

925
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:14,880
persistently now whenever you know as

926
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,830
you know we never cashed in SSL

927
00:36:16,830 --> 00:36:19,350
transactions we do catch the ram certain

928
00:36:19,350 --> 00:36:23,550
cases so lightly those two things won't

929
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:25,890
be compatible you may have to serve up

930
00:36:25,890 --> 00:36:28,230
something off that our HTTP I I don't

931
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:34,320
know if you're going that far you will

932
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,690
change the way extension developers

933
00:36:35,690 --> 00:36:41,970
interaction is there something about a

934
00:36:41,970 --> 00:36:51,020
few government in there things like that

935
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:59,730
explosives brown instead of exposing in

936
00:36:59,730 --> 00:37:04,110
JavaScript yeah so it's probably not so

937
00:37:04,110 --> 00:37:07,470
the question was for firefox extension

938
00:37:07,470 --> 00:37:09,600
developers will jazz to help me not have

939
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,670
to deal with xpcom and the short answer

940
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:15,560
is js2 probably won't but over time

941
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:18,480
because we're making JavaScript an

942
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,490
easier language to build components the

943
00:37:20,490 --> 00:37:22,140
browser because the performance the

944
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:24,210
engine is increasing basically almost

945
00:37:24,210 --> 00:37:25,530
any code we touch of the brow

946
00:37:25,530 --> 00:37:27,480
for these days writing JavaScript unless

947
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:28,530
there's a really good reason to object

948
00:37:28,530 --> 00:37:30,900
so the name rendering path will probably

949
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:32,700
never be in JavaScript but at easy

950
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:34,740
examples to password manager right

951
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:36,150
there's nothing really performance in

952
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:37,950
tons of about password manager it's a

953
00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:39,450
whole lot easier to write here cooking

954
00:37:39,450 --> 00:37:41,070
Jas and so you're going to see this as

955
00:37:41,070 --> 00:37:42,900
we evolved in touched it reports the

956
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:44,910
system a lot of stuff implementing jazz

957
00:37:44,910 --> 00:37:46,500
next photos through dance interfaces

958
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:55,110
will flicker out of it that's the other

959
00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:56,310
thing we're doing is trying to build a

960
00:37:56,310 --> 00:37:57,870
better interfaces are crossing gonna use

961
00:37:57,870 --> 00:38:00,420
a fuel so if you're going to develop her

962
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:02,070
down mozilla.org it's on their fuel is

963
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:04,080
kind of the first guard up what are all

964
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:11,480
the extensions do you know

965
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:45,200
the officials

966
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:01,480
sorry

967
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:08,460
or

968
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:22,750
I'm silence then why should one will win

969
00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:26,470
IL compiler or toaster so we're

970
00:39:26,470 --> 00:39:31,570
producers will again sir not very sir

971
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:33,880
why you two about taking old desktop

972
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:35,800
applications to the web we're going to

973
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:42,960
see web-based video and yeah sorry that

974
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:45,670
there are some applications other know

975
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:47,740
why use basic but the question was about

976
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:50,470
web video editing so it's probably not

977
00:39:50,470 --> 00:39:54,190
as good as you know final cut but we'll

978
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:56,080
see I think it's going to stress canvas

979
00:39:56,080 --> 00:40:04,319
a little bit so but that will get back

980
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:19,540
yeah that's a really good so the

981
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:22,450
question was offline caching and

982
00:40:22,450 --> 00:40:25,900
security how do you notify users of the

983
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:27,610
going on especially if they worked at

984
00:40:27,610 --> 00:40:30,600
Whole on a public share in trouble

985
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:32,650
you're not going to like my answer which

986
00:40:32,650 --> 00:40:34,150
is another one of these we're still kind

987
00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:37,510
of figuring it out there's a couple of

988
00:40:37,510 --> 00:40:39,190
quarts of CKD with ongoing hash just

989
00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:40,750
want to let them know that the data is

990
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:44,230
there too is in Firefox to its all

991
00:40:44,230 --> 00:40:45,610
plugged into the clear private data

992
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:48,760
function so there's feature and firebox

993
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:50,560
to basically remove all you know my

994
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,120
cookies and history anything

995
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:53,830
might be sensitive personally

996
00:40:53,830 --> 00:40:56,260
identifiable was an offline captions

997
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:57,970
already plugged into that so that will

998
00:40:57,970 --> 00:40:59,680
also get clear if you clear private data

999
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:01,660
so that's the easiest one which is just

1000
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:03,760
okay we're using a computer that you

1001
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:04,930
don't want the people see what you're

1002
00:41:04,930 --> 00:41:06,640
doing on just clear your data if you're

1003
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:09,340
going in terms of many people manage the

1004
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:10,990
storage and see what's there which sites

1005
00:41:10,990 --> 00:41:13,390
are using it that we haven't actually

1006
00:41:13,390 --> 00:41:15,340
gone down more at the path under table

1007
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:21,190
of the UI school blood area you've

1008
00:41:21,190 --> 00:41:22,330
already got one selling to give it to

1009
00:41:22,330 --> 00:41:28,230
someone else yeah

1010
00:41:39,559 --> 00:41:42,299
thank you want a soda question so the

1011
00:41:42,299 --> 00:41:44,700
question was on video and fedex and

1012
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:46,829
what's the winter future that is

1013
00:41:46,829 --> 00:41:48,750
something we're really interested in I

1014
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:50,069
don't think we're going to get rid of

1015
00:41:50,069 --> 00:41:51,660
you know lots inferred Kodak's in the

1016
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:53,490
future whether you know has been a lot

1017
00:41:53,490 --> 00:42:07,410
of questions about what's up yeah so

1018
00:42:07,410 --> 00:42:08,789
there's a question of should we embed

1019
00:42:08,789 --> 00:42:10,640
video and audio codecs into the browser

1020
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:15,000
and i'm pretty sure video already is a

1021
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,150
big part as web as its audio whether it

1022
00:42:18,150 --> 00:42:20,039
belongs in the browser with some kind of

1023
00:42:20,039 --> 00:42:22,079
pluggable Kodak's system so that at

1024
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:23,309
least the basic frame of the players

1025
00:42:23,309 --> 00:42:26,190
there or whether it continues to belong

1026
00:42:26,190 --> 00:42:27,930
and plugins to anders today with flash

1027
00:42:27,930 --> 00:42:30,359
and phenomena and deputy I don't really

1028
00:42:30,359 --> 00:42:32,460
know yet I think that the one thing we

1029
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:39,359
are related in is and push it down what

1030
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:44,880
kind of play possibly I think the thing

1031
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:46,019
that's most interesting to me about

1032
00:42:46,019 --> 00:42:48,690
video is how to make video jump outs on

1033
00:42:48,690 --> 00:42:50,970
boom box and actually interface with the

1034
00:42:50,970 --> 00:42:53,730
rest of the web and so if it performance

1035
00:42:53,730 --> 00:42:55,140
for the issue and you could have video

1036
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:57,269
within a canvas Tyler example I'll be

1037
00:42:57,269 --> 00:42:59,039
able to style rotate have an interactive

1038
00:42:59,039 --> 00:43:00,480
all the pieces of the contest like

1039
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:02,160
that's where the future of the web is

1040
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:04,769
with with video how that's actually

1041
00:43:04,769 --> 00:43:07,970
kinetic we're still covered

1042
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:35,789
yeah I the question was a security

1043
00:43:35,789 --> 00:43:38,190
manager in golf trip what is the gym

1044
00:43:38,190 --> 00:43:40,529
permissions or what is the thing you're

1045
00:43:40,529 --> 00:43:52,170
trying to do yeah it's um the answer is

1046
00:43:52,170 --> 00:43:53,369
yeah we would like some ways that

1047
00:43:53,369 --> 00:43:55,440
declaratively it's been a common problem

1048
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:57,779
on the web these days for people that do

1049
00:43:57,779 --> 00:44:00,509
content filtering so I usually never any

1050
00:44:00,509 --> 00:44:02,849
content you uploader to page you know

1051
00:44:02,849 --> 00:44:04,739
you have a small bug in your content

1052
00:44:04,739 --> 00:44:05,880
filter and someone's able to get some

1053
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:07,829
cover through there and then wham-o

1054
00:44:07,829 --> 00:44:08,640
you've been a cross-site scripting

1055
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:10,920
attack on that site because I i can

1056
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:12,749
upload code run it in the context of

1057
00:44:12,749 --> 00:44:14,789
your session and steal your cookies and

1058
00:44:14,789 --> 00:44:16,380
then steal your blog do whatever im

1059
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:20,190
doing that so so we are looking heavily

1060
00:44:20,190 --> 00:44:22,380
of ways to add some declarative parts to

1061
00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:24,900
javascript some really basic ones would

1062
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:27,059
be basically like no j/s after this you

1063
00:44:27,059 --> 00:44:29,009
know within this block or no gas after

1064
00:44:29,009 --> 00:44:31,650
the tags loaded so you can scan things

1065
00:44:31,650 --> 00:44:34,559
out lots of different ways to try and do

1066
00:44:34,559 --> 00:44:36,630
it so that use a website author don't

1067
00:44:36,630 --> 00:44:38,400
have to deal with it especially as the

1068
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:39,779
specs for things of all you know you

1069
00:44:39,779 --> 00:44:41,190
have to keep up with what all the latest

1070
00:44:41,190 --> 00:44:41,819
tags

1071
00:44:41,819 --> 00:44:44,430
that's worth it so it's another one of

1072
00:44:44,430 --> 00:44:45,900
those yeah it's something we will be

1073
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:50,219
doing zooming hopefully this is a

1074
00:44:50,219 --> 00:44:54,329
proposal relax at your neck / security /

1075
00:44:54,329 --> 00:44:57,150
content type and restrictions which I'm

1076
00:44:57,150 --> 00:44:59,130
going to get to the next couple of

1077
00:44:59,130 --> 00:45:04,979
months cool probably one more question

1078
00:45:04,979 --> 00:45:11,369
and then time to eat alright thanks a

1079
00:45:11,369 --> 00:45:13,489
lot
