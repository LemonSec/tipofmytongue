1
00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:18,700
thank you well it's a huge pleasure to

2
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:21,520
be here with your today if someone can

3
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:25,079
suggest it to me three years ago that i

4
00:00:25,079 --> 00:00:28,899
will be speaking for them that I'd be

5
00:00:28,899 --> 00:00:30,579
representing son that I'd be talking

6
00:00:30,579 --> 00:00:34,090
about John being GPL I would probably

7
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:37,530
laugh almost doesn't matter if you were

8
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:42,370
so it's it's really quite awesome to be

9
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:44,080
here talking about this for you today

10
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:46,120
what I could try and do for you is try

11
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:48,190
me as interesting as I can by not

12
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:49,840
talking for too long and getting some

13
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,610
other interesting people up here what

14
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:53,200
I'd like to do start off by talking to

15
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,390
you about why son is interested in free

16
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:57,520
software then talk to you a little bit

17
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,890
about the Java platform and free

18
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:02,020
software and you can use you to some of

19
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:03,910
the people who are making it happen and

20
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:10,329
then it'll go Punk thank you okay so I

21
00:01:10,329 --> 00:01:12,640
know if you if you thought about that

22
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,700
the impact that the eight the Internet

23
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:19,149
has had on society this is if you're

24
00:01:19,149 --> 00:01:21,429
using my presentation I I even enjoy

25
00:01:21,429 --> 00:01:23,409
graphics so everything that I'm learning

26
00:01:23,409 --> 00:01:26,679
so the structure of society for decades

27
00:01:26,679 --> 00:01:28,780
have been a structurally to be

28
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:31,719
hub-and-spoke it's been government in

29
00:01:31,719 --> 00:01:33,639
the middle with citizens out bespoke

30
00:01:33,639 --> 00:01:36,149
tell you things done to them it's been

31
00:01:36,149 --> 00:01:39,399
consumers that consumer society I always

32
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:42,310
think is a wonderful phrase it brings to

33
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:45,850
me above the Belgian idea of geeks

34
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:48,039
having called full-scale their throats

35
00:01:48,039 --> 00:01:51,729
ready to be turned into foie gras that's

36
00:01:51,729 --> 00:01:53,950
the consumer society hello that's all

37
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:56,079
part of this hub-and-spoke world with

38
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:58,359
people doing things controlling lee in

39
00:01:58,359 --> 00:02:00,700
the middle and giving them out to people

40
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:04,329
out of soaps and when the internet

41
00:02:04,329 --> 00:02:06,470
became a pervasive

42
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:10,639
necessary part of Western life this

43
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:13,310
mobile change it was no longer the case

44
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:15,650
that everyone was distributed out at the

45
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:18,020
end of spokes instead everyone was going

46
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:20,180
to everyone else and that began to

47
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:25,820
change everything now son and the Free

48
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:28,160
Software Foundation had both been

49
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,620
working with free software for a very

50
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:33,380
very long time if I told you about a

51
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:36,620
startup company California that use a

52
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:39,230
free operating system together commodity

53
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:42,709
hardware to introduce a computer

54
00:02:42,709 --> 00:02:44,510
technology that completely came to

55
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:47,030
computer industry you might think I was

56
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:48,560
talking about something that happened in

57
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,470
the in the mid to late 90s but actually

58
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:53,959
I'm referring to the work of builder and

59
00:02:53,959 --> 00:02:56,209
vinod khosla Annie and effect all time

60
00:02:56,209 --> 00:02:59,390
and stop really in the early ages they

61
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:02,000
took bsd unix and combine it with

62
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,610
off-the-shelf motorola arbor to produce

63
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:07,520
the workstation category completely

64
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,770
disrupting the monopolistic business of

65
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:11,209
the big computer companies at the time

66
00:03:11,209 --> 00:03:14,239
and that means some for the last 25

67
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:17,320
years is doing the doing that stuff and

68
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,489
right at the heart of what we've been

69
00:03:19,489 --> 00:03:21,950
doing has been this shift to a networked

70
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:23,660
society and the Free Software Foundation

71
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:26,150
has been doing the same thing in popular

72
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:28,640
culture in developer culture has been

73
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,730
making sure the ability to work is not

74
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:34,250
dominated in a hub of spoke way but it's

75
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:38,030
operated in on that way and so with

76
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:40,940
society shifting to a mesh model it's

77
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:44,030
time for things to change it's time to

78
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:49,430
head into this mesh world and to take to

79
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:53,720
wave goodbye to be fought Rockies now I

80
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:56,440
don't want to be a consumer anymore I

81
00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:00,950
want to be a participator and that mess

82
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:04,760
is what produces a participate name the

83
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,769
way that big software companies used to

84
00:04:06,769 --> 00:04:08,959
make software was by hiring all smart

85
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:11,300
people and locking them in a room and

86
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:14,540
sliding pizza under the door until later

87
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:15,980
written whatever it wasn't neatly

88
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:18,738
writing and then saying tickets to get

89
00:04:18,738 --> 00:04:22,160
into the room and that worked all the

90
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,320
time of statistically you could pass as

91
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,350
smart people BBC one thing still doing

92
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:29,840
those notice a long time goes you can't

93
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,630
hire all the smart people some of them

94
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:35,570
inevitably work somewhere else and you

95
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:38,750
know when you have a meshed society the

96
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:41,450
people that you could hire are all on a

97
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:43,130
network forming a statistically

98
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:45,380
significant unit and the people you

99
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:48,950
could I statistically around 20 and so

100
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:50,720
your software business involves having

101
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,790
none of the smart people working on

102
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:54,590
software in a closed room completely

103
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:56,960
against all of the smart people out on

104
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,729
the internet producing the same type of

105
00:04:58,729 --> 00:05:01,610
software faster and better and you know

106
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:03,410
I think I know which business I would

107
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:07,550
rather be so why is Sun getting into

108
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:09,770
free software well partly it's because

109
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:13,760
of our history with free software but

110
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,580
also it's because we believe that the

111
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:18,919
the way businesses do software is

112
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:21,260
changing when I got into the computer

113
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:24,200
industry rather too long ago and the way

114
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,900
it worked was you bought a piece of

115
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:28,580
hardware and it came with all the

116
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:30,979
software you could ever possibly need it

117
00:05:30,979 --> 00:05:32,960
was there on a punched tape in the

118
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,539
bottom of the shipping crate if you

119
00:05:35,539 --> 00:05:38,060
could find it in the the huge space of

120
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:40,310
the computer and so you'd buy a computer

121
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:41,720
with all the software you could possibly

122
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:44,780
need and go deploy it and it would all

123
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:45,770
be up and running and you would have

124
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:48,320
paid for it at the time that you bought

125
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,800
the computer software was paid for the

126
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,900
work of the laborers producing the

127
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:56,120
software was compensated at the time

128
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,610
that the hard way was selected in the

129
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:01,460
80s that all changed and people started

130
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:03,880
selecting software for business use

131
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:06,710
separately from the computer that they

132
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:08,210
were going to deploy it up and they were

133
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:09,979
then combined that software in that

134
00:06:09,979 --> 00:06:11,940
hardware to produce something that work

135
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:13,770
forum and the time they pay for the

136
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:15,620
software was at the time they close it

137
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:18,540
software companies invented this idea of

138
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:21,480
a commercial license I've never yet met

139
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,910
anyone apart from a software

140
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:26,580
manufacturer that likes selling licenses

141
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:30,480
or buying licenses no software user ever

142
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:33,630
wanted to buy a software license no none

143
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:36,450
of us wants to buy software what we

144
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:38,400
actually want is software that solves a

145
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,710
problem for us and what we would really

146
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:43,470
rather be paying for is for having the

147
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:47,010
problem solved and with the the rise of

148
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:49,530
the mesh society with the availability

149
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:52,350
of free software being created in open

150
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:54,480
source communities we've been able to

151
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:57,750
move to software market 30 in software

152
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:00,540
market 30 you're able to select the

153
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:03,690
software and assemble a solution that

154
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:06,930
works and go deploy it and it's entirely

155
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:09,990
up to you what you pay for when you no

156
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:12,600
longer have to pay in advance and so the

157
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,210
business of being a software vendor in

158
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:18,270
the 21st century is a business that is

159
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:21,290
about making good software and

160
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:23,430
unbundling the value proposition of

161
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:27,030
software for your end users so what

162
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:28,800
people used to pay for was a license to

163
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,210
get a black box they couldn't look

164
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:33,270
inside and they would have an implied

165
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:35,010
right to have all of these great things

166
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:37,950
down here some code ability to install

167
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:39,840
it some documentation may be as much as

168
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,020
a page you know maybe it's an education

169
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:45,240
maybe a warranty maybe a bit of

170
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,790
insurance thing is that most of us

171
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:50,190
didn't want all those things most of us

172
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:53,160
only wanted some of those things well in

173
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:56,340
a world of free software on in a mesh

174
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:59,400
society you actually only have to worry

175
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:02,340
about what you need and your it's your

176
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:04,230
choice what you pay for who you hire to

177
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:06,900
do things what you buy-in from vendors

178
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:09,630
to do things and so the software

179
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:11,610
business of the 21st century that Sun is

180
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:14,100
moving into is this software business of

181
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:16,770
being able to demonstrate value to our

182
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:19,050
customers and providing them with a

183
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:22,040
service that they can pay for that will

184
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,020
software running doing the things they

185
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:26,240
need get the new features added get the

186
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,270
bugs fixed and have them paying for just

187
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:31,700
what they want to pay for we're not

188
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:32,929
doing this out of a great sense of

189
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:34,700
philanthropy and love for the love of

190
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:37,580
the world this is just what's going to

191
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:40,039
happen because software companies can't

192
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:42,530
charge at the time of software selection

193
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:46,040
anymore because we collectively have

194
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:49,640
broken that business for them forever is

195
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,800
no longer possible to force people to

196
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,020
pay for software licenses because

197
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:57,350
software is liberated and software is

198
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:59,030
without charge as a result of being

199
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:04,850
liberated so what could upset all this I

200
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:06,020
just want to briefly mention this

201
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:08,150
there's been two earlier talks for those

202
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:10,220
of you who got up late and there was a

203
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:11,510
talk right at the beginning about

204
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:14,690
software patents and then we've just had

205
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:16,990
Jim talking about one laptop per child

206
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:20,920
on the subject of software patents and

207
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:24,020
son is one of many US companies that

208
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:27,080
file software patents regularly and the

209
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,550
reason that we file software patents

210
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:30,550
regularly is the same reason that

211
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:34,370
Americans buy guns Americans buy guns

212
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:38,440
because Americans buy guns

213
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:42,450
and American corporations file software

214
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:44,700
patents because American software

215
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:47,400
corporations file software patents if

216
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:51,570
you don't you are toast so really we've

217
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:53,220
got no choice but to file software

218
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:56,220
patents it isn't having software patents

219
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:58,080
that's the problem it's what you do with

220
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:02,430
them that's the problem and so one thing

221
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:04,050
I want to point out to you that you

222
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:06,480
really need to understand in addition to

223
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,070
the talk you heard earlier is that

224
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:10,440
software patents are filed in parallel

225
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:14,070
with development when people in your

226
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:16,740
community work for American software

227
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:18,870
corporations those corporations are

228
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:20,910
incenting them to file patents every

229
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:23,700
morning they're not getting them to wait

230
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:25,470
to the end of the process look for the

231
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:28,020
clever stuff and file patents on it what

232
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:29,430
they're doing is they're incenting them

233
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:31,110
every morning when they wake up to file

234
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:34,650
a patent they're filing in parallel with

235
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:36,990
development and that means that there is

236
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:38,850
a very strong chance that if you have

237
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:41,100
any corporate sponsored developers in

238
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,020
your community that they are filing

239
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:44,850
software patents on the work that you

240
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:47,700
are using in that community and you must

241
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:50,580
be aware of this it is happening in your

242
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:52,530
community the software patents are there

243
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:55,470
and the reason that they are a problem

244
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:57,660
is not because anyone is going to come

245
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:00,120
after you personally and see you as you

246
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:03,210
heard earlier the problem that is that

247
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:05,310
happens there is that whole communities

248
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:09,840
can be threatened by a threat to key

249
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:12,090
sponsors in the communities now what

250
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:13,680
happens with software patents is they

251
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,110
fall into the hands of parties who would

252
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:18,600
like to do things with them that are not

253
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,090
community friendly so let's say that I

254
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:23,460
as a company I'm busily getting on

255
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:25,980
contributing to free software filing

256
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:27,600
patterns at the same time because that's

257
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,780
what corporations do and it's the same

258
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:31,830
as you know

259
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:33,450
the reason you have kitty litter is

260
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:35,070
because of what cats do software

261
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:38,310
corporations file software patents I'm

262
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:40,980
busily filing the patterns I'm unlikely

263
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:45,210
to be harmful to you if should it perish

264
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:48,420
the thought some company that has been

265
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:50,640
filing patents go out of business its

266
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:53,070
patents are treated as assets in the

267
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:56,160
open market and the big threat to free

268
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,170
software is what happens when the people

269
00:11:58,170 --> 00:12:00,150
filing in parallel in your community

270
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:03,000
pass their patents to a hostile party

271
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,700
outside your community and that's the

272
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,740
reason that the art week we heard

273
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:09,540
earlier that software patents aren't

274
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:11,130
going to go away in the u.s. anytime

275
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:13,770
soon and we also heard earlier that

276
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:16,620
patents as a category in Europe are here

277
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:19,530
for a while I'm doing my best as I did

278
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:22,230
two years ago with Mark webbing from Red

279
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:24,630
Hat to trunk stops the software patent

280
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:26,610
directive in Europe but it's like it's

281
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:28,410
like a zombie you know every time you

282
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:30,150
look around he finds up out of the grave

283
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:32,640
and running down to the voting booths

284
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:35,760
down in the European Commission I spend

285
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,530
my time over here trying to kill it off

286
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:41,370
but it no it's us all keeps on coming

287
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:43,710
back so what can we do there's three

288
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:46,320
things that we can do one of them is to

289
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,510
accept patent grants from patent holders

290
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:50,460
and hold them in common was out in our

291
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:53,700
community now this is good but really

292
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,800
low value the reason it's really low

293
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,180
value is because if you look at any

294
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:59,370
software patent software patents don't

295
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:00,870
contain any useful information to

296
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:03,540
developers software patents are designed

297
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:06,690
to help lawyers know how to sue other

298
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:08,730
companies when they infringe the patent

299
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:11,130
so a software patent is a list of things

300
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:13,140
that you can have by which you can know

301
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:15,930
that someone is worth doing there's no

302
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:18,510
code samples in there the flow diagrams

303
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:21,510
are lame the languages are paying the

304
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:23,760
patents are worthless trust me I've read

305
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,180
lots of them so patent grants are great

306
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:28,890
and I'm really grateful for the

307
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:30,150
companies that have protected things

308
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:33,600
like Samba with patent grants but it's

309
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,030
insufficient what we actually need are

310
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:39,210
two things we need new software licenses

311
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:41,880
like the gplv3 that have strong language

312
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:42,480
that

313
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,540
patents in them and we need to have a

314
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:48,180
new approach to software standards that

315
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:49,560
makes sure that if you implement a

316
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,540
software standard like mp3 it's

317
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:54,329
impossible for any party to prosecute a

318
00:13:54,329 --> 00:13:56,339
patent claim against that international

319
00:13:56,339 --> 00:13:58,829
standard those are the two things that

320
00:13:58,829 --> 00:14:01,589
we need to do and I'd encourage you in

321
00:14:01,589 --> 00:14:04,440
your hatred for software patents which I

322
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:07,529
share with you to drive it into a

323
00:14:07,529 --> 00:14:09,630
positive treatment of the software

324
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:12,060
patents try and prevent applicability of

325
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:15,120
patterns in key areas okay that's my

326
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,130
advertisement for the day now back to a

327
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:22,410
quiz for you it is a quiz if you were to

328
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:25,440
look at the source code in the Debian

329
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,199
source code repository which company do

330
00:14:28,199 --> 00:14:30,690
you think you would find had written the

331
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:32,490
majority of the code in the Debian

332
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:36,630
source code repository any ideas is it

333
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:42,260
IBM is it red red heads it's go

334
00:14:43,939 --> 00:14:46,769
well as it turns out scurries number

335
00:14:46,769 --> 00:14:51,149
five on the list it turns out that son

336
00:14:51,149 --> 00:14:52,709
is actually the majority corporate

337
00:14:52,709 --> 00:14:54,689
contributor to the software that's in

338
00:14:54,689 --> 00:14:58,619
the Debian repository and son has

339
00:14:58,619 --> 00:15:00,420
contributed three times as much code as

340
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:02,569
IBM and five times as much as Red Hat

341
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:04,649
this is from a recent European

342
00:15:04,649 --> 00:15:06,839
Commission survey and so the question

343
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:10,040
remains why do you hate us

344
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:21,140
it doesn't give you some examples of

345
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:23,180
what that code is this isn't that this

346
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:24,560
isn't stuff that you don't want is this

347
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,990
is stuff you're using every day this is

348
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:28,850
the accessibility framework ingham own

349
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:30,950
this is orca this is the on-screen

350
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:34,220
keyboard this is the framework that IBM

351
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:35,990
has then reimplemented as I accessible

352
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:38,150
to on windows this is the

353
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:40,180
internationalization code in Mozilla

354
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:46,420
this is openoffice.org it's a key stuff

355
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:49,850
so all the people who wrote open office

356
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:53,540
work for some trust me I went and met me

357
00:15:53,540 --> 00:16:00,680
in Hamburg between so it strikes me that

358
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:01,880
what's been going on for many years

359
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,740
there's been two ribbons of free

360
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:05,840
software there's been a ribbon of free

361
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,790
software that has been going on in the

362
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:08,960
commercial world and there's been a

363
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,400
ribbon of free software that's been

364
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:13,160
going on in the collective world that is

365
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:16,610
represented here at fuzzed m and so I'd

366
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:18,700
encourage you to look beneath

367
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:21,230
competitive behaviors at the actual

368
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:23,240
behaviors of developers I've got a bunch

369
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,160
of developers that have come to fuzz

370
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,570
them this time to tell you about what

371
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:28,940
they're working on like OpenJDK and I

372
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:30,830
encourage you to go go meet them and

373
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:32,870
discover that whatever the competitive

374
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:35,120
postures and the stupid messages

375
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,330
executives give out actually there's

376
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,190
real developers contributing real code

377
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:41,630
and there are people who have already

378
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:45,800
changed your life now just to seal the

379
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,050
the two ribbons that are coming up I'm

380
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:51,980
announcing now now yes I that son has

381
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:53,210
become a patron of the Free Software

382
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:55,450
Foundation

383
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:05,660
and I think it's time for us to begin to

384
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:09,050
tie off the ribbons of hostility between

385
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:11,540
the old bsd worlds and the old GPL

386
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:14,780
worlds and begin to realize that we have

387
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:16,849
a great deal to gain by being united and

388
00:17:16,849 --> 00:17:18,890
working together and I think that's the

389
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:23,150
message that lies behind the OpenJDK so

390
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:28,660
let me show you a video here about Java

391
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:37,010
I'd love you to hear the words in free

392
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:39,110
software license the special thing about

393
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:41,720
this license is that it's a copyleft

394
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:45,170
license that is to say all versions of

395
00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:47,720
the program must carry the same license

396
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:51,260
so the freedoms that the gill GPL gives

397
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:54,950
to the users must reach all the users of

398
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:57,110
the program and that's the purpose for

399
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:59,300
which I wrote it it will be very good

400
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:01,190
that the java trap won't exist anymore

401
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:03,710
there will be a thing of the past that

402
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:06,679
kind of problem can still exist in other

403
00:18:06,679 --> 00:18:09,290
areas where won't exist for Java anymore

404
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:12,860
I think son has well with this

405
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:14,940
contribution

406
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:17,370
more than any other company to the free

407
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:20,070
software community in the form of

408
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:24,450
software and it shows leadership it's an

409
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:28,370
example I hope others will follow I

410
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:39,450
wouldn't I want you to get the idea here

411
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:43,280
that something big has changed okay I

412
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,870
could imagine going to Richards office

413
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:48,540
three years ago and asking him to record

414
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:51,330
a video where he said that the Java trap

415
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:54,210
no longer existed and that son was a

416
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:55,950
company that you encouraged other

417
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:58,260
companies to emulate so if you could

418
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:01,470
imagine that blew my mind completely to

419
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:03,870
make that video but something big is

420
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:06,900
going on here we're seeing a shift in

421
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:10,620
society that is making it correct for

422
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:12,720
software businesses to start doing free

423
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,490
software the way that free software

424
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:16,650
ought to be done that's the change of

425
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:18,570
tackling so now they're zooming in on

426
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:22,230
Java for you java as a as a technology

427
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:25,350
as a community has been around for over

428
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:29,580
a decade now when global was introduced

429
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:32,900
it was licensed in a revolutionary way

430
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:36,090
that meant that businesses all over the

431
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:38,010
world started to embrace it almost

432
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:40,590
immediately it wasn't licensed using of

433
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:42,630
a philosophy that was compatible with

434
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:45,000
free software but it was made available

435
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,250
on the release day with the full source

436
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:49,680
code and I at the time work for IBM

437
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:52,680
rather than for Sun and in her sleep

438
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,570
icked up all of the source code to Java

439
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:59,010
and we ported it to AIX and os/2 by July

440
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:01,320
of 1995 because all the source code was

441
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,940
there we didn't ask anyone's permission

442
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:05,970
we just went and did it and many many

443
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:07,950
groups all over the world did that and

444
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:11,490
proved to corporate observers that

445
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:13,440
keeping the source code secret wasn't

446
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,070
necessary a competitive advantage and

447
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:19,500
that experience I believe was the sea

448
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,810
that then allowed Mozilla to break

449
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:25,310
through and become a commercial

450
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:27,840
commercially visible free software

451
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:31,380
entity now we did that in 1995 and it

452
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:34,620
succeeded far beyond son's expectations

453
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:36,600
some was just completely overwhelmed

454
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:39,720
with demand and you know when you're

455
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,820
when you're a pioneer you often don't

456
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:43,410
look over your shoulder to see what's

457
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:45,300
behind you you can't you just keep on

458
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,650
looking forward and trying to duck the

459
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:49,110
arrows and if we looked over our

460
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:50,820
shoulder a few times we might have

461
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:52,680
realized that there was a free software

462
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,540
constituency that we really ought to

463
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:56,640
have been working with but we didn't and

464
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,300
it was done and it's taken a really long

465
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,370
time to get to the place where we've

466
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:04,440
realized we need to fix it but we've

467
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,970
realized that we need to fix it there is

468
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:08,580
a rich ecosystem already for Java that

469
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:10,650
includes both commercial activities

470
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:12,300
includes free software activities

471
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:15,480
includes community activities and it's

472
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:18,270
time to bring the ribbons together on

473
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:23,880
Java as well so I'm last November think

474
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:26,340
it was we we said that we were going to

475
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:29,760
GPL Java now to give you an idea of what

476
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,010
GPA lang-java means in software terms

477
00:21:32,010 --> 00:21:35,820
just the java SE the Java platform that

478
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:37,740
gives you a programming environment

479
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:39,660
that's the same on every platform just

480
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:41,610
that code is around about 6 million

481
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:44,700
lines of code that's before you've

482
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:48,060
accounted for everything else great big

483
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:50,640
piece of code and it's taking some time

484
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,290
for mark Reinhold down here in the front

485
00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:56,130
row to get everything done and so what

486
00:21:56,130 --> 00:21:58,020
we did was we started out by just

487
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:01,290
releasing the Java C compiler and the

488
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:03,660
hotspot virtual machine I was very

489
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:05,310
thrilled when that was released to

490
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:07,800
immediately see people like like mark

491
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:10,530
villa down here and daddy bought topic

492
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:13,470
wherever he is and up there and Tom trow

493
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:15,480
me picking this stuff up and compiling

494
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:17,610
it trying to break it and trying to use

495
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:20,670
it to test gcj and doing creative things

496
00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:23,010
with it that immediately started

497
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:25,290
happening so Java Sea and hotspot are

498
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:28,550
out already we've also taken the full

499
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:30,380
java mobile

500
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:32,510
and embedded platform and release that

501
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:34,910
under the GPL under the name mobile and

502
00:22:34,910 --> 00:22:37,310
embedded and that's already out that's

503
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:39,470
already very active that's already been

504
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:41,560
ported to a number of new places and

505
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:44,810
there's an interesting free software

506
00:22:44,810 --> 00:22:48,140
community growing around it we're going

507
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:49,940
to carry on with these code releases

508
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:52,700
over the next few months in the spring I

509
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:54,740
think that's about as precise as I dare

510
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:57,380
be is in the spring they will have

511
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:59,720
finished moving all the code over into a

512
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,880
public repository and it will be made

513
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:04,100
available under the GPL with the

514
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:06,440
classpath exception so that people can

515
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,720
work on that public codebase the reason

516
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,760
we're not just releasing it all at once

517
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,650
is actually we're continuing to do

518
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:15,110
business with this code we continue to

519
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:18,440
have business contracts and we're moving

520
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,630
it from a closed repository inside some

521
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:23,390
that's using something that actually

522
00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:25,460
predates bitkeeper written by the same

523
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:28,070
guy called teamwear and we're getting it

524
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:29,720
out of there need to a public repository

525
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,700
called mercurial and we want to make

526
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:33,410
sure we can carry on fulfilling our

527
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:36,080
commitments to our customers during that

528
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,700
transition period so it's taking us a

529
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:39,680
number of months to do it but mark is

530
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,150
definitely going to get done by the

531
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:45,200
spring on your mark yeah he's looking

532
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,710
very confident down here so so this is

533
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:50,930
the timeline that we're on we anticipate

534
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:54,920
having a full buildable java SE jdk jdk

535
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:59,030
7 down here somewhere in the spring and

536
00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:00,800
i'll leave you to work out where that

537
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,270
line might actually be pointing be

538
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:04,190
pointing and gets slight off the screen

539
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:07,100
quickly there's a few bits of the code

540
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:10,670
that are encumbered in order to when you

541
00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:12,230
write any piece of commercial software

542
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:14,090
in a world that doesn't have free

543
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:16,820
software in your mindset you sometimes

544
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:18,770
go and acquire stuff from third parties

545
00:24:18,770 --> 00:24:20,870
and when you acquire it you don't think

546
00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:22,880
to get the right to give arbitrary

547
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,220
unidentified third parties the right to

548
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:28,220
create redistributable derivative works

549
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:30,170
I mean no one even thinks of it because

550
00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:31,399
that's not what you learn

551
00:24:31,399 --> 00:24:33,169
you're about and we didn't get those

552
00:24:33,169 --> 00:24:36,619
rights for in particular java 2d the

553
00:24:36,619 --> 00:24:38,389
font rasterizer the graphics rasterizer

554
00:24:38,389 --> 00:24:40,639
and the color manager and their big

555
00:24:40,639 --> 00:24:43,249
chewy pieces of software and their

556
00:24:43,249 --> 00:24:45,469
encumbered at the moment so when the jdk

557
00:24:45,469 --> 00:24:46,759
comes out in the spring it's going to

558
00:24:46,759 --> 00:24:49,249
have some binary plugs in it but we want

559
00:24:49,249 --> 00:24:50,690
to get rid of those as fast as possible

560
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:53,359
and that's potentially where you come in

561
00:24:53,359 --> 00:24:56,839
because it may well be that in a like

562
00:24:56,839 --> 00:24:58,549
Sven for example that you've been

563
00:24:58,549 --> 00:25:01,669
working on a color manager and we'd like

564
00:25:01,669 --> 00:25:03,169
to hear from you we'd like you to come

565
00:25:03,169 --> 00:25:06,409
join them in with this community because

566
00:25:06,409 --> 00:25:08,089
I believe that we can have a completely

567
00:25:08,089 --> 00:25:10,309
free Java in the fastest possible time

568
00:25:10,309 --> 00:25:12,349
if we get everyone working together on

569
00:25:12,349 --> 00:25:16,070
the same code base just to complete the

570
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:18,409
picture we've we've got all of java SE

571
00:25:18,409 --> 00:25:20,629
under the GPL in the spring all of

572
00:25:20,629 --> 00:25:22,669
Galvan mobile is already under the GPL

573
00:25:22,669 --> 00:25:27,259
also all of Java EE is under the GPL we

574
00:25:27,259 --> 00:25:29,749
decided we'd we would add the GPL

575
00:25:29,749 --> 00:25:32,779
license to the existing license on Java

576
00:25:32,779 --> 00:25:35,839
EE so the story was complete now what

577
00:25:35,839 --> 00:25:37,549
this means is that you have available to

578
00:25:37,549 --> 00:25:40,639
you a complete stack of Java software

579
00:25:40,639 --> 00:25:42,710
which is free software under the GPL

580
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:44,389
that you can do anything you want with

581
00:25:44,389 --> 00:25:46,969
and it stretches all the way from

582
00:25:46,969 --> 00:25:49,639
embeddable code for mobile devices all

583
00:25:49,639 --> 00:25:51,919
the way to enterprise code you can use

584
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:54,349
to program mainframes and all points in

585
00:25:54,349 --> 00:25:56,929
between the key way that this software

586
00:25:56,929 --> 00:25:59,179
differs from other virtual machine

587
00:25:59,179 --> 00:26:01,509
environments you may have seen before is

588
00:26:01,509 --> 00:26:05,450
is in the area of Java EE what Java EE

589
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:09,649
does is it virtualizes or generalizes

590
00:26:09,649 --> 00:26:13,070
enterprise interfaces so when you use

591
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:15,080
Java EE you're not locked into any

592
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:17,059
particular vendor of databases or

593
00:26:17,059 --> 00:26:18,679
message queuing systems or other

594
00:26:18,679 --> 00:26:20,509
enterprise facilities like you would be

595
00:26:20,509 --> 00:26:23,629
if you use mono net for example you

596
00:26:23,629 --> 00:26:25,460
haven't you have an a generalized

597
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:27,919
abstracted environment which will work

598
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:29,410
with any vendor and what

599
00:26:29,410 --> 00:26:33,430
work with any free software okay yeah

600
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:37,780
JCP yup people asked us whether we

601
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:40,150
worried about compatibility in all this

602
00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:43,660
stuff the one of the key selling points

603
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:45,580
of the Java platform the thing that has

604
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:47,200
made sure that there are over five

605
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,670
million commercial developers working

606
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:50,560
with it the thing that has made that it

607
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,360
made it be present on two million

608
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:55,330
devices is the fact sorry two billion

609
00:26:55,330 --> 00:26:58,990
devices is that you can be pretty sure

610
00:26:58,990 --> 00:27:01,180
that the Java environment is the same in

611
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:04,150
every place you find it inevitably

612
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:05,350
there's going to be little differences

613
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:08,380
here and there but broadly speaking the

614
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:10,300
best way to get a piece of software that

615
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:13,270
has a binary that runs anywhere is to

616
00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:15,700
use the Java platform and it's through

617
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:17,920
java compatibility compatibility that

618
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:21,280
that works compatibility is ensured by

619
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:26,500
testing and the testing regime is going

620
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:28,450
to remain in place as we move forward

621
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:31,030
into the world of free Java that's going

622
00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:32,530
to mean that you can use the code to do

623
00:27:32,530 --> 00:27:35,260
anything you want with if you want a

624
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:37,150
call it java you'll still have to take a

625
00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:40,150
test we'll make that test available

626
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:44,050
without charge suitable nonprofits we're

627
00:27:44,050 --> 00:27:45,370
going through a bit of a transition as a

628
00:27:45,370 --> 00:27:47,560
company at the moment and exactly how

629
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:50,380
that like that testing license works out

630
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:52,540
is a tricky question for us because

631
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:53,830
we've actually got a bunch of people

632
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:56,350
whose livelihoods depend on selling test

633
00:27:56,350 --> 00:27:58,390
kits at the moment and we have to find

634
00:27:58,390 --> 00:28:02,170
new jobs for them so we would really be

635
00:28:02,170 --> 00:28:05,020
pleased if you stick with us while we

636
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:07,630
find new jobs for those folks but

637
00:28:07,630 --> 00:28:09,460
because in the interim phase there's

638
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:11,050
going to be a point where we can't quite

639
00:28:11,050 --> 00:28:14,500
do things the way that we'd like to okay

640
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:16,870
now I've done lots of talking there

641
00:28:16,870 --> 00:28:19,690
let's get some community voices in here

642
00:28:19,690 --> 00:28:21,610
first one that I first thing I'd like to

643
00:28:21,610 --> 00:28:23,770
do is I'd like to introduce you to Tom

644
00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:27,670
marble tom is at son's open lady came

645
00:28:27,670 --> 00:28:28,640
ambassador

646
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:32,120
nervous about coming up here we go Tom I

647
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:41,690
i did a dangerous thing I think last

648
00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:44,300
year and took Tom's took Tom to debconf

649
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:46,790
in Mexico was waterfront and yeah and

650
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:51,770
and he went native and so so we decided

651
00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:53,300
we ought to move him off his day job

652
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:54,560
when you were doing something like are

653
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:56,420
you doing a job a performance

654
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:58,220
performance testing or something yes oh

655
00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:00,140
yes performance automation and I've been

656
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:02,240
sort of doing community related things

657
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:05,170
with with Java for the past year and

658
00:29:05,170 --> 00:29:08,840
going to defcon was a great experience

659
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:10,430
for me and one of the things that we did

660
00:29:10,430 --> 00:29:14,150
last year as we liberalised our license

661
00:29:14,150 --> 00:29:16,010
a little bit to make Java

662
00:29:16,010 --> 00:29:20,180
redistributable with distros and

663
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:22,190
opensolaris and the next and so on and

664
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:25,130
now this year of course we're going the

665
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:27,980
full way with the GPL yep so the one of

666
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:29,960
the you know when I just looked at Java

667
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:32,300
on free software platforms it was in a

668
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:34,340
pretty sad state to be honest with you

669
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:36,890
son spend a lot of its time making it

670
00:29:36,890 --> 00:29:40,250
work on windows with a almost unhealthy

671
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:42,520
focus on competing with a certain

672
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:46,640
northwestern American company and and

673
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,930
we'd forgotten about the free software

674
00:29:47,930 --> 00:29:50,120
platforms and we were still faithfully

675
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:52,820
producing rpms of the Java of the JDK

676
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:56,210
but they really needed to be a genius to

677
00:29:56,210 --> 00:29:58,490
install them and you needed to be a

678
00:29:58,490 --> 00:29:59,990
double genius that then make them run

679
00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:02,960
after you'd install them and there were

680
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,090
no packages that worked with the Debian

681
00:30:05,090 --> 00:30:07,820
packaging system and it was it was

682
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:10,700
really a really a mess and the the guys

683
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:12,830
on class path from the all the

684
00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:14,720
affiliated VMs really of doing a bold

685
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:17,300
job trying to patch up the hole that we

686
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:19,520
were leaving but really it was necessary

687
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,080
to get a new packaging system together

688
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:23,570
Tom came to dead conference at writing

689
00:30:23,570 --> 00:30:26,870
it on the floor in in Mexico well I did

690
00:30:26,870 --> 00:30:27,650
a little bit I really

691
00:30:27,650 --> 00:30:31,220
to give most of the credit to Mattias

692
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:33,260
close I was here who did a lot of the

693
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:40,000
work with debian thank you my dear so

694
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,230
tell me Tom how are we getting on with

695
00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:43,610
OpenJDK where is it going to be

696
00:30:43,610 --> 00:30:45,470
available sometime soon I think the

697
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:49,660
springtime Simon yeah for real for real

698
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:52,550
all of it and what are you gonna do

699
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:55,010
about community governments well this is

700
00:30:55,010 --> 00:30:56,660
one of the things that I wanted to talk

701
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:59,210
about on one of the things that's really

702
00:30:59,210 --> 00:31:01,100
exciting about joining the free software

703
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:03,020
world for Java is that now we're going

704
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:04,760
to be able to collaborate and a

705
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:07,730
particular market we heart and I have

706
00:31:07,730 --> 00:31:10,130
talked a lot about ways that we can

707
00:31:10,130 --> 00:31:12,080
collaborate and mark has a couple of

708
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:15,350
sessions today on a class path and the

709
00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:17,480
runtime Rumble and what's coming for

710
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:19,730
class path and so we're very excited to

711
00:31:19,730 --> 00:31:22,730
collaborate with the classpath community

712
00:31:22,730 --> 00:31:25,130
and OpenJDK and think of ways that we

713
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:28,370
can grow together so that's that's today

714
00:31:28,370 --> 00:31:30,470
and then tomorrow we have an open JDK

715
00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:31,990
session where we're going to talk about

716
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:34,010
governance and we need your input

717
00:31:34,010 --> 00:31:36,710
because we want to have a governance

718
00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:38,990
model for OpenJDK that works for

719
00:31:38,990 --> 00:31:40,790
everyone and it's very participatory so

720
00:31:40,790 --> 00:31:42,410
we're going to have a discussion about

721
00:31:42,410 --> 00:31:44,900
governance tomorrow and a contribution

722
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:47,570
policy and we also have some engineers

723
00:31:47,570 --> 00:31:51,770
here from Java 2d hotspot the Java

724
00:31:51,770 --> 00:31:53,900
compiler and quality that are going to

725
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:56,150
talk a little bit about what's cool with

726
00:31:56,150 --> 00:31:58,910
that each part of OpenJDK and we're

727
00:31:58,910 --> 00:32:00,710
really hoping that will become a lively

728
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:03,470
interactive discussion on the technology

729
00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:05,690
that's cool that you can now access in

730
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:08,300
the free world with OpenJDK and then

731
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:10,880
after that we have the Def Jam we have

732
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:14,720
representatives from Debian RedHat Jen

733
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:17,150
to hopefully Susie and other other

734
00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:19,400
distributions to talk about packaging

735
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:22,340
issues for java on all of the

736
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:24,730
distributions because once we solve the

737
00:32:24,730 --> 00:32:27,770
issues of packaging the jvms the

738
00:32:27,770 --> 00:32:30,770
libraries and the applications now java

739
00:32:30,770 --> 00:32:31,730
can become an inter

740
00:32:31,730 --> 00:32:34,640
a part of a tool chain for distributions

741
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,620
and then we can do some really exciting

742
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:37,940
kinds of innovation so that's what's

743
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:39,830
coming great so if you think we're

744
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:43,150
screwing up at all Tom marble at suncom

745
00:32:43,150 --> 00:32:49,310
ok I really don't every website yeah and

746
00:32:49,310 --> 00:32:50,900
if you can't remember that ombudsman

747
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:53,360
that suncom will do just as well ok I

748
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,220
rip those seriously if you think they're

749
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:57,320
screwing up I want to hear about it the

750
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:58,820
first time that we're screwing up I want

751
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:00,140
to hear about it at one of those email

752
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:01,940
addresses and preferably not on the

753
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:04,010
front page of your website somewhere so

754
00:33:04,010 --> 00:33:07,310
we fixed a number of screw-ups through

755
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:08,810
those email addresses over the last year

756
00:33:08,810 --> 00:33:11,000
and make his life miserable if we doing

757
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,010
something wrong and buying beer if we're

758
00:33:13,010 --> 00:33:15,860
not he made her mark Villard mark going

759
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:19,360
to come up and come talk to us

760
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:28,549
so mark is one of the one of the heroes

761
00:33:28,549 --> 00:33:31,340
of free Java there's a few others around

762
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:34,850
the room actually who that tom is hiding

763
00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:36,890
up there somewhere i think i got

764
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:38,630
there'll be sitting there he moved down

765
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:40,070
the other areas is moved down here and

766
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:42,409
there's a few other focus there's dolly

767
00:33:42,409 --> 00:33:44,809
ball up there really hiding in the back

768
00:33:44,809 --> 00:33:47,630
trying not to be noticed these guys have

769
00:33:47,630 --> 00:33:49,490
kept the hope of free Java alive through

770
00:33:49,490 --> 00:33:51,710
the years when son's management was

771
00:33:51,710 --> 00:33:54,289
doing its level best to be done and I

772
00:33:54,289 --> 00:33:58,669
didn't say that of course and and I when

773
00:33:58,669 --> 00:34:00,350
we're really grateful to you for doing

774
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:03,289
that um how do you feel about OpenJDK is

775
00:34:03,289 --> 00:34:04,700
it ruining your life are making you

776
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:07,730
miserable it takes some let that thing

777
00:34:07,730 --> 00:34:10,790
but luckily you didn't release

778
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:16,510
everything yet so partly we are now in a

779
00:34:16,510 --> 00:34:19,730
padded spend color let's steal that

780
00:34:19,730 --> 00:34:23,239
cookie before they give it away so we're

781
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:26,359
actually really working hard to be the

782
00:34:26,359 --> 00:34:29,719
first but and then you released one of

783
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:37,609
six here what would is behind again to

784
00:34:37,609 --> 00:34:39,739
be honest I think we are going to make

785
00:34:39,739 --> 00:34:47,119
your life a bit harder because half of

786
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:51,020
our work is compatibility we we saw want

787
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:55,399
to be the free thing that you can run

788
00:34:55,399 --> 00:35:00,380
any Java and if the Java Java ice cream

789
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:02,300
then that leaves the compatibility

790
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:07,330
partners is taken care of and then we

791
00:35:07,330 --> 00:35:11,089
can really compete on on innovating

792
00:35:11,089 --> 00:35:14,089
things and that's when one of the things

793
00:35:14,089 --> 00:35:16,970
you you won't like this of course that

794
00:35:16,970 --> 00:35:19,460
we're certainly going to make all that

795
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:21,380
brand with not net

796
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:29,299
oh yes but but we have been doing that

797
00:35:29,299 --> 00:35:33,789
yeah and and it will be fun to see can

798
00:35:33,789 --> 00:35:38,269
donate now now be a better java and java

799
00:35:38,269 --> 00:35:41,329
at least now there's a chance to prove

800
00:35:41,329 --> 00:35:49,279
that or or disprove the same with gcj we

801
00:35:49,279 --> 00:35:53,509
have a native costume party and wow

802
00:35:53,509 --> 00:35:55,940
wasn't always the fastest that at least

803
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:58,400
was the free one and how we also have to

804
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:05,269
make it the fastest to be better well we

805
00:36:05,269 --> 00:36:08,960
have good we are going to make sure that

806
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,579
everything that you haven't released the

807
00:36:10,579 --> 00:36:13,579
update that will be available we have an

808
00:36:13,579 --> 00:36:18,109
awt based on gtk+ right to the graphics

809
00:36:18,109 --> 00:36:21,289
based on chi era which i think is

810
00:36:21,289 --> 00:36:25,519
interesting so and we're just going to

811
00:36:25,519 --> 00:36:28,069
talk them see well we have a lot of

812
00:36:28,069 --> 00:36:29,359
things that we can learn from you

813
00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:30,470
already about the way that you

814
00:36:30,470 --> 00:36:32,240
collaborate the way that you automate

815
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:38,240
testing the way that you you do all

816
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:41,180
kinds of auto tools related things where

817
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:42,980
you know we have our own strange and

818
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:44,980
arcane with a build system story mark

819
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:47,569
that is going to take some adapting to

820
00:36:47,569 --> 00:36:49,039
you and we can learn a lot from you in

821
00:36:49,039 --> 00:36:53,019
that process i hope so

822
00:37:03,010 --> 00:37:06,230
it's about technology of programming in

823
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:09,740
the last decade the question of Java's

824
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:12,170
freedom whether it could be used freely

825
00:37:12,170 --> 00:37:15,140
and made part of free software projects

826
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:18,770
has been a crucial question sons policy

827
00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:21,680
of GP LOL Java which we are celebrating

828
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:25,130
now is an extraordinary achievement in

829
00:37:25,130 --> 00:37:28,550
retool program and technology to that

830
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:32,180
state freely available knowledge son has

831
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:36,320
now GPL hardware designs son is gpo and

832
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,810
java that's an extraordinary vote of

833
00:37:38,810 --> 00:37:41,120
confidence in this way of sharing

834
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:44,270
information and we own the free software

835
00:37:44,270 --> 00:37:46,660
world are very pleased and very

836
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:50,210
flattered to see some taking it's all

837
00:37:50,210 --> 00:37:53,390
very valuable and very important

838
00:37:53,390 --> 00:37:56,450
products and agree with us that they

839
00:37:56,450 --> 00:37:58,670
will be more advantageous to son as well

840
00:37:58,670 --> 00:38:01,100
as to the rest of the community if they

841
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:10,550
are shared under these laws that really

842
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:12,710
was everything that I won't say do you

843
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:14,830
hear today I wanted to tell you that

844
00:38:14,830 --> 00:38:17,630
it's been a wild ride certainly for me

845
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:20,690
in the last two years with son I believe

846
00:38:20,690 --> 00:38:23,660
that son son is still a corporation and

847
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:24,620
you should never turn your back on

848
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:29,600
corporations and I know you won't so I

849
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,820
know you're going to keep us honest but

850
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:34,700
we honestly want to work with free

851
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:36,440
software because we believe that our

852
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:39,200
business is best served by working with

853
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,390
everybody in the open room rather than

854
00:38:41,390 --> 00:38:42,980
by trying to get everyone into a closed

855
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:45,200
room we believe that that's the future

856
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,120
of the software business and we believe

857
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:49,130
yes ok I'll admit it we believe will

858
00:38:49,130 --> 00:38:51,890
make more money by doing free software

859
00:38:51,890 --> 00:38:54,140
than all those other companies are going

860
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:55,990
to do by doing their clothes stuff and

861
00:38:55,990 --> 00:38:58,670
well we go to work with you on that and

862
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:01,190
well you know I don't know how many of

863
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:03,140
you are going to work on sons payroll I

864
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:04,190
don't know how many of you

865
00:39:04,190 --> 00:39:06,380
other people's payroll but we're moving

866
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:08,119
into a future where we're able to

867
00:39:08,119 --> 00:39:10,310
synchronize the interests that we each

868
00:39:10,310 --> 00:39:12,710
have whether it there be about one

869
00:39:12,710 --> 00:39:14,810
laptop per child and by the way we

870
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:17,240
didn't just randomly release the open

871
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:19,849
firmware for one laptop per child I OPC

872
00:39:19,849 --> 00:39:21,560
actually asked me and I released it

873
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:23,869
under BSD so they could use it and we

874
00:39:23,869 --> 00:39:25,160
didn't put out a press release because

875
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:27,280
the only people who wanted it with them

876
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:31,940
just just in case you wondered we intend

877
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:36,470
to pioneer a 21st century free software

878
00:39:36,470 --> 00:39:38,599
business and we want to do that in a way

879
00:39:38,599 --> 00:39:40,760
that helps you succeed at your goals as

880
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:42,790
well so at any point that we screw up

881
00:39:42,790 --> 00:39:46,460
Ombudsman at suncom Tom marvel at song

882
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:49,730
song com simon phipps at song com write

883
00:39:49,730 --> 00:39:52,010
to us and tell us that we're screwing up

884
00:39:52,010 --> 00:39:54,710
and apart from that I look forward to

885
00:39:54,710 --> 00:39:56,839
collaborating and cooperating with you I

886
00:39:56,839 --> 00:40:00,430
over the Java platform / Mozilla over

887
00:40:00,430 --> 00:40:04,339
the Thunderbird and lightning over all

888
00:40:04,339 --> 00:40:06,410
of the other packages genome and so on

889
00:40:06,410 --> 00:40:08,150
that we're working on together thank you

890
00:40:08,150 --> 00:40:10,990
very much for paperless

891
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:21,920
and we've got time for some questions

892
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,380
that don't go there go away mark we have

893
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:27,950
got time for some questions and take the

894
00:40:27,950 --> 00:40:29,480
gift what do you fancy getting let go

895
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:30,920
out there who raised his hand with a

896
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:34,839
microphone oh he can get to yes go

897
00:40:34,839 --> 00:40:36,829
anyone down the front one to ask a

898
00:40:36,829 --> 00:40:38,119
question while that microphones heading

899
00:40:38,119 --> 00:40:41,470
up there yes raise our hand again please

900
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:49,220
my question is about dynamically typed

901
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:52,460
languages I know that the JRuby guys

902
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:56,599
will hide last year by son what is the

903
00:40:56,599 --> 00:40:58,520
commitment to getting dynamically tight

904
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:02,450
land which is running on the JVM and I

905
00:41:02,450 --> 00:41:04,220
think you better do it quickly because I

906
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:07,400
think that northwestern American company

907
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,980
might be doing the same I think I've

908
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:11,480
noticed I'm hiring a few people as well

909
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:13,250
yes funny you should ask that because

910
00:41:13,250 --> 00:41:14,780
the guy who's dubba deez is over here in

911
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:17,210
the front row this is Mark Reinhold I

912
00:41:17,210 --> 00:41:23,660
he's the COO think year ago so so we

913
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:25,940
develop gods and son had sort of

914
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:27,049
attitudinally has gone through this

915
00:41:27,049 --> 00:41:28,819
transition where we're definitely seeing

916
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:31,220
Java as two things which is kind of what

917
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:33,079
it's always been there's drama the

918
00:41:33,079 --> 00:41:34,400
language which is great for a bunch of

919
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,750
stuff and there's dropped the platform's

920
00:41:35,750 --> 00:41:37,190
the vm and all the infrastructure and

921
00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:39,290
the libraries and java platform is about

922
00:41:39,290 --> 00:41:41,720
more than java the language so not only

923
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:43,910
we hire their JRuby guys but we're

924
00:41:43,910 --> 00:41:45,920
working closely with them there's going

925
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:50,329
to be a JSR rd is a JSR for a new byte

926
00:41:50,329 --> 00:41:52,490
code called them folk dynamic which is

927
00:41:52,490 --> 00:41:54,770
useless for john totally pointless as

928
00:41:54,770 --> 00:41:57,140
far as job is concerned but for or

929
00:41:57,140 --> 00:41:58,650
scripting languages or

930
00:41:58,650 --> 00:42:01,509
dynamically typed languages it can bring

931
00:42:01,509 --> 00:42:03,309
like an order or two magnitude

932
00:42:03,309 --> 00:42:05,349
performance improvement and so we're

933
00:42:05,349 --> 00:42:07,180
actively working on that with the JRuby

934
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:08,799
guys and other folks so so java the java

935
00:42:08,799 --> 00:42:10,749
platform is definitely about a lot more

936
00:42:10,749 --> 00:42:14,019
than just drop the language so one of

937
00:42:14,019 --> 00:42:16,420
the things that i've started 18 months

938
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:19,900
ago was in our NetBeans tool was support

939
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:23,380
for four groovy and for Jason so it

940
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:25,239
isn't just Ruby that we're that we're

941
00:42:25,239 --> 00:42:27,160
supporting there is one of this it's

942
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:28,839
something I've been I've been banging on

943
00:42:28,839 --> 00:42:31,269
about for ten years five years at IBM

944
00:42:31,269 --> 00:42:34,450
within five years of Sun is that there's

945
00:42:34,450 --> 00:42:36,789
a there's a guy called talks Dorf who's

946
00:42:36,789 --> 00:42:38,859
got a website with all of the languages

947
00:42:38,859 --> 00:42:40,450
that run on the Java VM there's some

948
00:42:40,450 --> 00:42:43,599
like 130 of them and we've finally got

949
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:47,019
some to admit they exist and so we are

950
00:42:47,019 --> 00:42:49,420
now actively working on on scripting

951
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:51,309
language or dynamic languages or indeed

952
00:42:51,309 --> 00:42:53,440
other other languages that work on Java

953
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:56,019
VM I I'm not sure I can think of very

954
00:42:56,019 --> 00:42:57,369
many languages that wouldn't work on the

955
00:42:57,369 --> 00:43:01,210
job of you question of the bag I was

956
00:43:01,210 --> 00:43:04,049
very pleased and encouraged about the

957
00:43:04,049 --> 00:43:07,630
your intentions and your ethical value

958
00:43:07,630 --> 00:43:09,059
systems that you mentioned earlier

959
00:43:09,059 --> 00:43:11,769
specifically in regard to sams patent

960
00:43:11,769 --> 00:43:14,559
portfolio unfortunately I'm not

961
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:18,279
convinced that your intentions and

962
00:43:18,279 --> 00:43:20,140
values are necessarily shared by the

963
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:23,710
directors of Sun and even if they are

964
00:43:23,710 --> 00:43:27,249
they are they have to do what their

965
00:43:27,249 --> 00:43:29,019
shareholders tell them and the

966
00:43:29,019 --> 00:43:32,039
shareholders can change overnight and is

967
00:43:32,039 --> 00:43:35,529
there any intention with in San to do

968
00:43:35,529 --> 00:43:38,529
with the GPL equivalent to its its

969
00:43:38,529 --> 00:43:41,259
patents and that is to dedicate them to

970
00:43:41,259 --> 00:43:46,539
the public so that there's not an intent

971
00:43:46,539 --> 00:43:48,700
to do that the reason that we file the

972
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:50,140
patterns in the first place is because

973
00:43:50,140 --> 00:43:52,140
we're competing against a very big

974
00:43:52,140 --> 00:43:54,339
unconvicted monopolist in the northeast

975
00:43:54,339 --> 00:43:56,770
of the US and a very big convicted

976
00:43:56,770 --> 00:43:58,530
toplist in the northwest of the US and

977
00:43:58,530 --> 00:44:01,480
those two companies and we need our

978
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:02,980
patent portfolio in such a way that

979
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:04,360
we're able to use it to defend ourselves

980
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:05,710
against them and a couple of other

981
00:44:05,710 --> 00:44:08,290
companies what I am keen for us to do

982
00:44:08,290 --> 00:44:11,080
however is to lock ourselves up in traps

983
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:13,690
so we can't exercise our patents against

984
00:44:13,690 --> 00:44:17,080
the community so that's what the pattern

985
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:18,910
on cert covenants are avail for example

986
00:44:18,910 --> 00:44:20,740
so we've we've made a covenant around

987
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:22,960
open document format that says that

988
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:25,060
whatever patents we've got we promise

989
00:44:25,060 --> 00:44:27,430
you that we won't exercise them against

990
00:44:27,430 --> 00:44:29,020
any implementation of open document

991
00:44:29,020 --> 00:44:31,810
format and that that means that Sun on

992
00:44:31,810 --> 00:44:33,910
its heirs and the signs are unable to

993
00:44:33,910 --> 00:44:35,740
litigate against implementers I guess

994
00:44:35,740 --> 00:44:37,240
implementations of open document format

995
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:39,280
and going forward you'll see us make

996
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:41,560
more of those non assert covenants in

997
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:43,030
areas where we're working with the

998
00:44:43,030 --> 00:44:45,640
community but the the way that the

999
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:47,350
patent system in the u.s. is set up

1000
00:44:47,350 --> 00:44:49,690
there are no easy answers for how to

1001
00:44:49,690 --> 00:44:51,940
both defend yourself against aggressive

1002
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:53,710
monopolists and uncommitted monopolist

1003
00:44:53,710 --> 00:44:57,010
and how to also behavior ethically and

1004
00:44:57,010 --> 00:44:58,440
responsibly in a community and

1005
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:01,060
ultimately I think we need to together

1006
00:45:01,060 --> 00:45:02,950
work out what the new new ways of doing

1007
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:05,740
that up I I talk I talked a lot with the

1008
00:45:05,740 --> 00:45:09,070
FII folks 18 months ago and goeth

1009
00:45:09,070 --> 00:45:11,410
cokeman and on from there and really

1010
00:45:11,410 --> 00:45:12,490
we've still not reached an agreement

1011
00:45:12,490 --> 00:45:16,480
about ways that that actually work now

1012
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:18,910
there's ways that look good but working

1013
00:45:18,910 --> 00:45:20,220
out ways that actually work in

1014
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:22,570
protecting us I mean we got sued by a

1015
00:45:22,570 --> 00:45:23,950
patent troll that you'll be very

1016
00:45:23,950 --> 00:45:27,580
familiar with company called Kodak they

1017
00:45:27,580 --> 00:45:29,710
they state they bought a company that

1018
00:45:29,710 --> 00:45:31,030
had bought a company that had bought a

1019
00:45:31,030 --> 00:45:34,210
patent that related to object-oriented

1020
00:45:34,210 --> 00:45:36,760
technology and they took out an

1021
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:38,710
injunction against this over Java and

1022
00:45:38,710 --> 00:45:41,110
were threatening to stop shipment of

1023
00:45:41,110 --> 00:45:42,460
Java to anyone anywhere in the world

1024
00:45:42,460 --> 00:45:44,280
which we thought was a really bad idea

1025
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:46,570
but we didn't have any patterns we could

1026
00:45:46,570 --> 00:45:48,370
fight them with and so we had to pay

1027
00:45:48,370 --> 00:45:50,020
them 90 million dollars so that they

1028
00:45:50,020 --> 00:45:50,650
would get off

1029
00:45:50,650 --> 00:45:52,450
even though we believe that their patent

1030
00:45:52,450 --> 00:45:55,000
claim was worthless because in the u.s.

1031
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,860
they could get injunctive relief against

1032
00:45:56,860 --> 00:45:58,480
this and stop of shipping our code they

1033
00:45:58,480 --> 00:45:59,830
didn't have to prove a case they could

1034
00:45:59,830 --> 00:46:01,390
simply say we're going to prove a case

1035
00:46:01,390 --> 00:46:02,950
later so will you stop them shipping it

1036
00:46:02,950 --> 00:46:05,650
while we prove it please and that's the

1037
00:46:05,650 --> 00:46:07,660
situation we've got we have to be able

1038
00:46:07,660 --> 00:46:09,730
to defend ourselves against I hated that

1039
00:46:09,730 --> 00:46:12,750
it's that way and I wanted to change I'm

1040
00:46:12,750 --> 00:46:14,680
much more importantly want to make sure

1041
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:16,060
it doesn't happen in this on this

1042
00:46:16,060 --> 00:46:18,340
continent because at the moment as you

1043
00:46:18,340 --> 00:46:19,750
heard earlier we don't have the laws in

1044
00:46:19,750 --> 00:46:21,640
place that make it happen here and I

1045
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:22,660
really want to make sure it doesn't

1046
00:46:22,660 --> 00:46:24,300
happen here but in the u.s. I'm sorry we

1047
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:26,650
it would be irresponsible of us to

1048
00:46:26,650 --> 00:46:28,360
dedicate our patents to the public

1049
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:30,820
domain but I'm very keen to do

1050
00:46:30,820 --> 00:46:32,200
responsible things in connection with

1051
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:36,790
our communities thank you any other

1052
00:46:36,790 --> 00:46:38,740
question so we're doing still got five

1053
00:46:38,740 --> 00:46:41,410
minutes there's when your assignment the

1054
00:46:41,410 --> 00:46:46,780
question somewhere over there tom yeah

1055
00:46:46,780 --> 00:46:49,020
ah

1056
00:46:57,090 --> 00:46:59,440
mom could you like we got to repeat the

1057
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:03,460
question is there any likelihood of

1058
00:47:03,460 --> 00:47:06,070
multiple inheritance being added to Java

1059
00:47:06,070 --> 00:47:08,830
the languages that's the question I

1060
00:47:08,830 --> 00:47:16,390
think the answer is no a different

1061
00:47:16,390 --> 00:47:18,250
answer is hey you already have it with

1062
00:47:18,250 --> 00:47:20,470
with interfaces but multiple England

1063
00:47:20,470 --> 00:47:23,859
implementation heritance and another

1064
00:47:23,859 --> 00:47:24,940
answer is you could always write a

1065
00:47:24,940 --> 00:47:28,500
language that ran on the VN the added

1066
00:47:33,450 --> 00:47:38,500
but mark you you know the kitchen sink

1067
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:43,990
language that is based on Java Sea butta

1068
00:47:43,990 --> 00:47:46,510
pets be accepted in a branch for the

1069
00:47:46,510 --> 00:47:49,950
kitchen sink language for that

1070
00:47:52,230 --> 00:47:59,040
where's fee that so one of the people we

1071
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:00,390
brought with us is a guy who we've got

1072
00:48:00,390 --> 00:48:04,650
this pretty good thank you so so fun

1073
00:48:04,650 --> 00:48:08,580
doraha is I guess not here he's the Java

1074
00:48:08,580 --> 00:48:11,540
C compiler lead at son he created a

1075
00:48:11,540 --> 00:48:15,530
project on dragnet called ksl java.net

1076
00:48:15,530 --> 00:48:17,430
this is actually an idea that james

1077
00:48:17,430 --> 00:48:19,530
gosling had its the kitchen sink

1078
00:48:19,530 --> 00:48:21,570
language so you know we open source java

1079
00:48:21,570 --> 00:48:23,850
see the compiler and now people are

1080
00:48:23,850 --> 00:48:26,490
taking Java Sea and Remy for apps is

1081
00:48:26,490 --> 00:48:29,400
here somewhere he's been prototyping new

1082
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:31,109
syntax for declaring and accessing

1083
00:48:31,109 --> 00:48:32,670
properties and stuff and so people are

1084
00:48:32,670 --> 00:48:34,740
going wild and it's great exploring

1085
00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:37,080
random language ideas as the the baby

1086
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:39,840
case 7 ball gets rolling you know what

1087
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:41,190
language changes might might be

1088
00:48:41,190 --> 00:48:43,650
considered for that so that's what ksl

1089
00:48:43,650 --> 00:48:47,310
is all about it so let me back up a

1090
00:48:47,310 --> 00:48:48,900
little bit the thing about multiple

1091
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:50,609
inheritance II it's not gonna be added

1092
00:48:50,609 --> 00:48:51,869
to drop it because I he's actually

1093
00:48:51,869 --> 00:48:53,940
technically infeasible that doesn't mean

1094
00:48:53,940 --> 00:48:56,970
it's a bad idea of itself it's just

1095
00:48:56,970 --> 00:48:58,740
really really tricky to get right and

1096
00:48:58,740 --> 00:49:00,540
people who have done it in programming

1097
00:49:00,540 --> 00:49:03,060
languages so far at least it might you

1098
00:49:03,060 --> 00:49:05,520
haven't gotten a right but that's say

1099
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:06,690
you see me over beer or something i'll

1100
00:49:06,690 --> 00:49:12,840
talk more yes my name is patty Knowlton

1101
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:14,460
from the school linux and debian project

1102
00:49:14,460 --> 00:49:17,430
and i'm really happy to be one of the

1103
00:49:17,430 --> 00:49:19,230
people organizing the dead job in a

1104
00:49:19,230 --> 00:49:23,130
later on my question is that when son is

1105
00:49:23,130 --> 00:49:25,440
missing some pieces which is encumbered

1106
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:27,930
with the current java and class but

1107
00:49:27,930 --> 00:49:29,700
already have on with a compatible

1108
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:32,070
license will you actually take it from

1109
00:49:32,070 --> 00:49:35,650
12 top mark

1110
00:49:35,650 --> 00:49:39,280
I know the answer to that question but I

1111
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:43,900
let mark tell you we can dip our answers

1112
00:49:43,900 --> 00:49:52,180
um we let's see I am NOT a lawyer so

1113
00:49:52,180 --> 00:49:54,400
there's a sole contribution we can't

1114
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:57,490
just be we can't just pick out random

1115
00:49:57,490 --> 00:49:59,710
code out there and pull it in right it

1116
00:49:59,710 --> 00:50:01,330
has to be contributed but we're

1117
00:50:01,330 --> 00:50:02,770
hopefully we're going to be working the

1118
00:50:02,770 --> 00:50:04,750
lights clasp at folks and and it all

1119
00:50:04,750 --> 00:50:08,200
being lb 11 fun good party fit filling

1120
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:10,210
this stuff in so yeah I hope there's

1121
00:50:10,210 --> 00:50:15,820
plenty of opportunity for Koecher so I

1122
00:50:15,820 --> 00:50:17,650
give my out so well do it come on answer

1123
00:50:17,650 --> 00:50:19,930
that was well not is that coke annoying

1124
00:50:19,930 --> 00:50:25,720
up and I've been to anything I'm not

1125
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:29,640
church going into up yet ok but this it

1126
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:34,510
certain people will combine and how

1127
00:50:34,510 --> 00:50:38,920
precisely we figure out who is working

1128
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:43,780
on what is it's going to be interesting

1129
00:50:43,780 --> 00:50:48,400
and of course you yeah but that is why

1130
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:52,330
we are here and besides saw the

1131
00:50:52,330 --> 00:50:56,080
licensing and there's the community and

1132
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:58,240
people being proud of their own codes I

1133
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:03,910
i know i am so it will take some

1134
00:51:03,910 --> 00:51:07,930
convincing to replace my coat with god

1135
00:51:07,930 --> 00:51:10,990
somebody else wrote which can never be

1136
00:51:10,990 --> 00:51:14,890
as good as michael and probably they

1137
00:51:14,890 --> 00:51:17,530
have the same feeling about some of

1138
00:51:17,530 --> 00:51:25,530
their code so we work something out so

1139
00:51:25,530 --> 00:51:27,670
in essence there's no reason why I

1140
00:51:27,670 --> 00:51:29,080
shouldn't going that there are there is

1141
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:30,820
that there are a few tiny problems in

1142
00:51:30,820 --> 00:51:34,090
the way that the AWT in in class path is

1143
00:51:34,090 --> 00:51:36,310
architected is radically different to

1144
00:51:36,310 --> 00:51:38,740
the way that the AWT in OpenJDK is

1145
00:51:38,740 --> 00:51:40,590
architected and so it isn't

1146
00:51:40,590 --> 00:51:41,910
matter of picking up and throwing it in

1147
00:51:41,910 --> 00:51:42,990
there there is actually some heavy

1148
00:51:42,990 --> 00:51:44,490
lifting to do to get make it going I

1149
00:51:44,490 --> 00:51:46,290
think I think that's what you told me

1150
00:51:46,290 --> 00:51:50,670
wasn't it yeah yeah it is our awts based

1151
00:51:50,670 --> 00:51:55,010
on GP k + + d 2 k plus s solution slight

1152
00:51:55,010 --> 00:51:58,400
changes in semantics with how things

1153
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:02,040
work and compatibility for some it's a

1154
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:07,080
very big thing so keeping great back

1155
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:10,140
layout working yes it's an interesting

1156
00:52:10,140 --> 00:52:17,100
problem actually just a quick update as

1157
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:19,050
assignments encumbrance libelous was a

1158
00:52:19,050 --> 00:52:21,830
little bit stale we actually have

1159
00:52:21,830 --> 00:52:24,320
resolved the color management library

1160
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:26,760
encumbrance by incorporating I think it

1161
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:29,610
was a little CMS so that that's actually

1162
00:52:29,610 --> 00:52:32,670
done Igor who's sitting down here is

1163
00:52:32,670 --> 00:52:34,170
from the 2d team and he's actually

1164
00:52:34,170 --> 00:52:36,780
working on integrating free type in as a

1165
00:52:36,780 --> 00:52:39,180
replacement for the proprietary font

1166
00:52:39,180 --> 00:52:41,040
rasterizer so if you're interested in

1167
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:43,830
that topic you can talk to Igor we're

1168
00:52:43,830 --> 00:52:45,510
still kind of scratching our heads over

1169
00:52:45,510 --> 00:52:47,250
the whole graphics rasterizer thing and

1170
00:52:47,250 --> 00:52:49,080
looking at chiro and other stuff and

1171
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:52,050
that's a really hard one so we'd also

1172
00:52:52,050 --> 00:52:53,970
welcome think of your your input up

1173
