1
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:14,910
I've been working on it and until I'm

2
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:19,230
working I'm the exodus and a hero who I

3
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:23,040
was with hey I'm DX which is why we let

4
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:27,720
me talk about today so that the first

5
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:31,050
out of this August is about what amvx is

6
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:35,190
how it works and some problems i wiII

7
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:39,840
happen we try to do next whether the

8
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,540
second happen is all going to be about

9
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:44,220
what kind of problems are still in there

10
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:48,120
what does we won't and what what what's

11
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:54,089
needed to definitive so its impacts on

12
00:00:54,089 --> 00:00:57,600
atiq late a molar movie because of the

13
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,019
desktops

14
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,040
Oh

15
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:38,670
you reign her output mode setting Mattie

16
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:43,729
this is the deal Figgis a most improper

17
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:21,929
library yeah

18
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,290
the night

19
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:30,790
thank you

20
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:40,010
so the reckless did the normal rate for

21
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:58,520
the eggs uber is that Kevin and

22
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:04,880
friend request in to me ok and

23
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:10,820
difficulty exit connection bc egg

24
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:13,010
containing different movements and then

25
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:16,670
takes after a little bit performs an

26
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:19,040
essay come here so the right thing that

27
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,340
was trying to the next time you go so

28
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:23,810
and this is this is a little comparison

29
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:26,060
that it is over hat and this is what

30
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:28,239
allows us to work over a network and

31
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:31,190
remote is made over here in canada the

32
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:38,170
90 and maybe send a pandemic respect so

33
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:44,360
with an NGO we open gyoza possibly the

34
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:50,930
3d and graphics API is available on all

35
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:53,510
platforms and if you want to use over

36
00:03:53,510 --> 00:04:00,170
here under Deano GX this is

37
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:03,150
and instead of the extension to specify

38
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:07,400
how old he'll text yes sir th month and

39
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:10,920
in this case then connects has two basic

40
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:14,189
modes of operation SC indirect lower

41
00:04:14,189 --> 00:04:16,738
operational piece which is pretty much

42
00:04:16,738 --> 00:04:18,539
how X formally works and there's a

43
00:04:18,539 --> 00:04:24,570
director so in this case that s the

44
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:26,550
application wants to be rendering sting

45
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:29,850
link things to give that kid GL which

46
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:32,729
this is similar to what amazes when you

47
00:04:32,729 --> 00:04:35,669
render regulate requester links to this

48
00:04:35,669 --> 00:04:39,449
one here like with in internet votes he

49
00:04:39,449 --> 00:04:42,270
found the dx11 works in a very remote

50
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:45,000
the library razon performed very much

51
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,830
the same time as we takes a level that

52
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:49,380
is if you want to render this 3d model

53
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:52,020
you send all the 3d triangles and your

54
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:54,330
sense of textures and gives has into

55
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:59,240
detail pls take this hundred request and

56
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:09,510
network like SNL DX over and again the

57
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:11,250
extras on the other cells network will

58
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:14,099
increase connection receives the regular

59
00:05:14,099 --> 00:05:17,520
office and hasn't been

60
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:22,110
man the way it used to work was that in

61
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:24,389
this entire case where the xserve

62
00:05:24,389 --> 00:05:25,830
receives the random offense over the

63
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:29,490
network and the XO would have a correct

64
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:33,990
implementation of the year yeah so you

65
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:36,479
want to rather try to enforce a software

66
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:39,270
so do scale integration of the triangle

67
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:41,520
and perform the text of the box and

68
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,759
regular to trying it step by step this

69
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:46,289
won't be done in software and it makes

70
00:05:46,289 --> 00:05:49,050
me live the only limitation recover this

71
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:51,659
one is the screen and that's also waste

72
00:05:51,659 --> 00:05:54,539
know that if you have a factory so some

73
00:05:54,539 --> 00:05:58,110
40 are indirect granular slow and 10

74
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:00,810
software and data by noon which is your

75
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:10,530
case was a fantastic ok so I'm not

76
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:12,960
rebounding from adam to incur game

77
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,560
because it's done yes I'd we don't talk

78
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,069
to over

79
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:25,370
alright so so as I mentioned that lesson

80
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:27,919
has another mode of operation for for

81
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:31,699
the on GL finding this is the diamond

82
00:06:31,699 --> 00:06:34,930
book and in this case

83
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:22,890
alright that's a tiny spot so this is

84
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:24,780
the award BTW we match the answer in

85
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:29,130
case another nation to UGL just painted

86
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:31,860
the entire case is where the application

87
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:34,920
talks to the GH come on wigs for them

88
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:39,900
and take the regular first panel over

89
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:43,530
here to the xserver well Felix module

90
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:46,860
receives the vm their requests in Santa

91
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:49,290
Costa and since the simply renders

92
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:51,510
replacing to the gym karate and this

93
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:53,760
this is a software rasterization house

94
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:56,580
home about the tanks the triangles do

95
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:58,970
this kind of information and original

96
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:03,480
copies if the consciousness cream the

97
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:06,120
other cases is a dollar case and this is

98
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:09,540
this is where we reside / tuned to

99
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:11,100
deviate from how the excellent only

100
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:14,250
works in this case what we end up with

101
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:17,100
is a driver eh to moving Nate into the

102
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:19,320
drive so we have education up here but

103
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:22,650
they need to live here but then ask

104
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:25,100
attractions is not rendering then

105
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:28,830
there's a local author then step in the

106
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:33,900
yield sahabat alternator and if it asks

107
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,820
the xserve atheism and a terrific

108
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:37,979
because that's usually the preferred

109
00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:40,740
mode of a break it is the excellences

110
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:44,190
yes I could do that until not half a key

111
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,740
name of private reload and the address

112
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:49,220
of the rainbow so so it is part the

113
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:53,730
client actually no square member the

114
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:56,610
frame of this we're trying to look in

115
00:08:56,610 --> 00:09:00,810
the system to noted the genomic the

116
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:03,840
drivers yes is yellow with them d lotus

117
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:07,220
and in each lattice

118
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:10,589
so in this part we actually have the

119
00:09:10,589 --> 00:09:12,689
driver for the hardware disco instantly

120
00:09:12,689 --> 00:09:14,970
the client and the car starts somebody

121
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:17,970
pregnant requests into the driver into

122
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:20,720
the clinical all the different so we

123
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,240
received a rating of Christmas the iPod

124
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:26,180
which instead of style soccer well

125
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:29,610
program Harper to gratify some tracks or

126
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:34,290
the triangles SS necessarily set up

127
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:37,170
pointless to the textures swimming naked

128
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:40,259
video everything in them written

129
00:09:40,259 --> 00:09:42,689
everything on screen directly and the

130
00:09:42,689 --> 00:09:45,329
acer basically doesn't doesn't know what

131
00:09:45,329 --> 00:09:47,910
can happen because it just asked out the

132
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:51,420
paper project and and the the diagonals

133
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:57,060
of to do all right so there's a tiger in

134
00:09:57,060 --> 00:10:03,269
case and since this is harper and we

135
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:06,149
load the driver the times i had from in

136
00:10:06,149 --> 00:10:08,970
the hopper and then the hopper doesn't

137
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:10,709
mean this is a source of service with

138
00:10:10,709 --> 00:10:13,170
the fat render connection between me and

139
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:22,309
follow time in your adrenaline was the

140
00:10:22,309 --> 00:10:25,680
XOXO doesn't happen but it is is it is

141
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,339
hardly some someone because you

142
00:10:28,339 --> 00:10:31,110
solutions think the only video she have

143
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:33,269
a Knicks so if you have a next window

144
00:10:33,269 --> 00:10:35,339
you can run into your ex is in talks

145
00:10:35,339 --> 00:10:37,470
reason and you drank another window the

146
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,040
top of you

147
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,579
with the director has to a state that

148
00:10:42,579 --> 00:10:44,430
window and so you had your surrender

149
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:47,139
across your external whatever it's your

150
00:10:47,139 --> 00:10:49,360
you having trouble can talk show

151
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,880
yourself whenever whenever the windows

152
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:54,910
move for the tip Rex chains there's that

153
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:56,589
civilization going on between the

154
00:10:56,589 --> 00:10:59,889
diagram cloud and Exum so some dexter

155
00:10:59,889 --> 00:11:02,319
assess most you have to be read the

156
00:11:02,319 --> 00:11:05,680
fittest and whenever the diagram time is

157
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,959
ready to do some reading goes and we

158
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:10,449
doing to campus so that it doesn't all

159
00:11:10,449 --> 00:11:25,860
right does the English okay so

160
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:28,959
accelerator interest which is what 8 on

161
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:32,050
your license is the case where we made

162
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:35,440
1px over to note the Opera and use the

163
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,490
harbor drive to implement any requests i

164
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:42,310
became committee so we want to do you

165
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:44,079
want to make the extra work away if you

166
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:47,199
know the dusk on all is good because

167
00:11:47,199 --> 00:11:51,220
won't use the previous work but then the

168
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:53,019
reason why we have direct window in the

169
00:11:53,019 --> 00:11:55,420
first place is that and we want the

170
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:58,329
phones and we'll do the xserver with the

171
00:11:58,329 --> 00:12:00,430
normal version we don't really need that

172
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:05,170
much performance and the overhead or we

173
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:07,660
need performance but we avoided for

174
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,440
continued in imagining

175
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,110
in network access is negligible compared

176
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:14,000
to actual rendering especially if you

177
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,160
have to fall back to software so when

178
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,810
you see you XO being slow if you're

179
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:20,960
storing the story at pho red rhinestone

180
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,460
is terrific first we have to fall back

181
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:25,040
to software operating software so

182
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,530
because we have too much time sending it

183
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:32,260
or a tankful no waste software fell back

184
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:39,440
but 400 you know we never do something

185
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:43,760
is always mostly always Harper and since

186
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,880
we're running crate you want the biggest

187
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:48,920
possible spread wait a second they're

188
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:51,650
tearing everything matters so we can

189
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:53,480
avoid the net we access here we might

190
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,430
get one to make some frames per second

191
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:58,040
wait and then that's one of the reasons

192
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:04,460
we sung is most compatible so the

193
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:06,170
question is which we have data better

194
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:09,440
which is faster than the innervation and

195
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,240
it does to say why we want to fix

196
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:16,190
everything and there's a few reasons we

197
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:19,010
both item listen collects it's taking a

198
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:24,020
role which is which is probably the

199
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:29,990
timer grab underneath this work so for

200
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:33,080
companies the combustion render cupcakes

201
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:36,560
is an OpenGL application that renders

202
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,230
the entire screen the entire desktop

203
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:40,000
using

204
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,790
deal and the dust so using the

205
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:45,970
compositing center what the compositing

206
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:48,550
center allows you to the sample you take

207
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:51,340
the contents of the window and nobody

208
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:53,620
went times the applications running to

209
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:55,540
win any cleaner it's render the right

210
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:57,820
into the frame of pleased to see the

211
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:59,790
contents of a large penis as the

212
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:02,500
applications render what the message

213
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:05,010
does this is all that rendering and

214
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:07,000
without the application know themselves

215
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,530
all the regular guy happens to the

216
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:11,380
office paper so the dedication we going

217
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:13,270
to remember any requests and the

218
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:16,030
excellent for these minor arrests or if

219
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:17,230
you want actually appear on the screen

220
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:19,510
as you sleep it will go into an

221
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:23,050
all-school boxes this is why he wants or

222
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:25,210
needs on this mini river because we

223
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:26,680
don't need million of these oxygen

224
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:29,260
bubbles but that's the dissident up we

225
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:30,640
give this practice very clever quickly

226
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,680
because that allows us then to determine

227
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:35,890
how we gonna composite however for my

228
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:37,810
knees off your buffers on screen and

229
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:39,850
this is where stuff I transparent window

230
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:42,250
the pedometer also meant because we do

231
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:45,540
this in a second step where you have

232
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:50,620
then use an extra channels and injure in

233
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:56,050
the pic map TT selling the transparency

234
00:14:56,050 --> 00:14:59,560
sticks and then equally scalar windows

235
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:04,720
SS SS computer and then what are the

236
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,900
cases of these possibilities and

237
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:10,089
companies actually have another / to go

238
00:15:10,089 --> 00:15:13,690
from your food defense to something how

239
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:14,790
the negative

240
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:17,160
for every we need some way to go from

241
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,830
the pic map in external media room or

242
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:23,250
anything so to end text it to text that

243
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:28,440
that we can use for NGO to render and

244
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,000
this is this isn't live is it takes from

245
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,760
global attention this context and pizza

246
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:37,470
not related this was this is a sentence

247
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:46,050
let's allow a detection so as SNS keep

248
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:48,930
few questions when we talk about doing a

249
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:53,430
title next yield to him probably not

250
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:55,920
feasible because semi education two

251
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,860
different only limitation but conclude

252
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:01,500
it this way once we have overkill ex

253
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,140
already available inside yourself we can

254
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:07,230
do this piecewise that's a regulation

255
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:11,580
accelerate say XD using OTL we can do

256
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:13,440
that for one driver where we have that

257
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:17,240
feature able if not something we can do

258
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:21,180
the compositing for any visual here in a

259
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,370
specific travel we can enable that and

260
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:26,370
easy so it may be a rose up a lot of

261
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:31,590
this work in fact the excimer and as

262
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:39,440
such this is some it is this an ad- and

263
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:43,080
and of course they able to take you use

264
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:46,690
exhilarating opium across a network is

265
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:53,570
you have your free having a server that

266
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:57,529
s the political arena driving infection

267
00:16:57,529 --> 00:16:59,390
and exhilarating eggs on a desktop and

268
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:02,000
run the application from it from act and

269
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,250
a foundation server support those of the

270
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:07,970
GPU accelerated in this case of course

271
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:12,109
the canyon on this case is that if you

272
00:17:12,109 --> 00:17:16,609
have takes just like you have to say we

273
00:17:16,609 --> 00:17:18,109
take us through the network without

274
00:17:18,109 --> 00:17:19,640
rendering you can't we can download the

275
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,730
protection separated because climate

276
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:26,959
progress on the same cosmic space but

277
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:31,100
overall the misery in rate exorcism is

278
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:33,440
interesting because we we we can then

279
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,970
accelerate these positive manner that

280
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:44,660
Google uses state so all of it is so

281
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:49,070
from from an to 20,000 feet perspective

282
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:53,540
this is easy we have been completely

283
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:57,650
there's an X or don't do I got in pretty

284
00:17:57,650 --> 00:18:00,740
much same way that the kind would notice

285
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:06,080
you are similar and another this is the

286
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:10,340
top that you did such a fine just the

287
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:13,309
exit will set up to southeast but Emily

288
00:18:13,309 --> 00:18:15,590
we can at the exit you support and

289
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:18,050
divert me refresh your frame of their so

290
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:20,330
a king from going on between this line

291
00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:22,760
is the xserver turns out all this is now

292
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:25,010
just in terms of the excuse so we can

293
00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:27,800
just go into given our next person to

294
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:30,230
say when you support a direct question

295
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:32,750
finger so only see plays a subjective

296
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:35,540
another smoke from going out and hit the

297
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:39,740
wire and then the Exuma already has a

298
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:43,670
module infrastructure so we we can use

299
00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:45,559
dildo in the exhibition to go to the

300
00:18:45,559 --> 00:18:50,140
right on making it and any comment and

301
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:52,520
when it we need to provide some from

302
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:55,760
functionality to the dr I browser so

303
00:18:55,760 --> 00:19:00,170
that no matter how into the exhibit for

304
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:03,910
for various pieces of information and

305
00:19:07,649 --> 00:19:13,080
in general it is business tactic just a

306
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:16,080
better deal opening the driver live

307
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,820
tweeting interfaces to to make sure that

308
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:20,259
the drunk and get impatient with me for

309
00:19:20,259 --> 00:19:28,720
the external my first yeah gotta skip

310
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,100
this slide this is about how we

311
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:33,580
initialize official kind of messy but it

312
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:39,399
was made it before if so what one of the

313
00:19:39,399 --> 00:19:41,500
more interesting case of problems and

314
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,149
we're a nation is what was then the

315
00:19:43,149 --> 00:19:47,950
island so in a case when we have direct

316
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:50,019
winner we have an avocation way that

317
00:19:50,019 --> 00:19:51,580
notes the driver too much you program

318
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:54,100
the hopper so this miserable seats to

319
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:57,340
the Opera 241 friends of triangles the

320
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:59,220
same time we have the exit over here

321
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:02,289
soon say who will bit around by from the

322
00:20:02,289 --> 00:20:05,110
matter to copy what happen to us so both

323
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:07,419
these applications are trying to access

324
00:20:07,419 --> 00:20:09,309
the same hardware and programming 15

325
00:20:09,309 --> 00:20:12,100
things so we need to synchronize this in

326
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:15,340
some way and and and then way to do this

327
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:17,590
to list for the people knock around

328
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:22,210
whole things so that's the way it works

329
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:25,090
is that the DI driver knows that has to

330
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:27,039
synchronize X stenography knows that

331
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:29,440
there might be different di funny you

332
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,200
didn't have to cover some seriously have

333
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:35,019
quite over here

334
00:20:35,019 --> 00:20:37,460
if you can have several times and at the

335
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:39,499
same times and you need to respect that

336
00:20:39,499 --> 00:20:42,769
so that your I'd rather then no decline

337
00:20:42,769 --> 00:20:46,940
to do the regular already OSIS details

338
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:51,109
when they write about you too many uses

339
00:20:51,109 --> 00:20:53,840
it once it's done on the other hand of

340
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,629
the XO doesn't know about the locket you

341
00:20:56,629 --> 00:20:58,369
think that one without me except our

342
00:20:58,369 --> 00:21:03,109
neck surgery just goes off button so

343
00:21:03,109 --> 00:21:06,470
mostly browser written teacher just any

344
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:07,970
more than you expect whatever they

345
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:09,830
submit to the card is still valid next

346
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:11,049
time they come around the Platte River

347
00:21:11,049 --> 00:21:13,850
that's not the case in this because you

348
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:16,759
might frontpoint one this would be the

349
00:21:16,759 --> 00:21:20,090
river bit in the 80 maybe the exit is

350
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:22,100
swapped out and the dark Amerikan Gunz

351
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:24,649
and also in training for t-rex peers and

352
00:21:24,649 --> 00:21:26,690
then make service walking again and now

353
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:27,919
this day is completely different from

354
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:30,769
the last time it has to happen so we

355
00:21:30,769 --> 00:21:32,960
need some mechanism around this to make

356
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,509
sure that the XLR get confused so what

357
00:21:35,509 --> 00:21:37,879
we do is s as soon as we receive

358
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:39,950
requests at request from the other side

359
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:42,679
we take the island and restore the stage

360
00:21:42,679 --> 00:21:45,919
with XOX ecstasy and then we go off

361
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:48,590
again rather than a request tisha and

362
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:52,369
then when we trusted how we render all

363
00:21:52,369 --> 00:21:54,230
the requests that was sitting in alcohol

364
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:56,749
and tell people we go back to sleep

365
00:21:56,749 --> 00:22:06,710
original sequitur we release enough so

366
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:08,450
let's listen and people

367
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:11,270
a server and they declined to start

368
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:14,120
learning class that result you and then

369
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,950
this is a most efficient way to do

370
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:35,630
things for the voice and yeah as far so

371
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:41,290
the question is if this dog is a stir

372
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:45,950
the freezing when you forget about the

373
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:48,680
education creases doesn't run continue

374
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:51,470
the window and a fellow business

375
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:55,700
students because an essay deprivation to

376
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:57,470
drag it around the egg so is just

377
00:22:57,470 --> 00:23:00,290
saturated with requests to moving around

378
00:23:00,290 --> 00:23:04,580
and listen a bunion bootie and the

379
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:06,800
education system the other hand time to

380
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,990
render policies that allow you stayed

381
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:10,820
all the time especially when you're out

382
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:12,770
so does this very gratefully locked in a

383
00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:20,690
way which interview so this is this is

384
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:22,790
not the most efficient way to go so we

385
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:29,780
get this but it basically words any the

386
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:32,250
better way to do this would be

387
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:35,490
I knew about it up and could only take

388
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:37,710
it for that short on time technique you

389
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:39,840
to remember which is survived a

390
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:43,950
connection press them to another or

391
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:47,070
whatever it is the XO needs to do you do

392
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:52,220
it probably see this is you go away and

393
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:54,630
only you have convention doctors

394
00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:57,630
architecture where you submit and the

395
00:23:57,630 --> 00:24:04,350
driver gets rid the software that is but

396
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:05,970
angry then the interesting part is it

397
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:09,090
but this lock set up we will begin to

398
00:24:09,090 --> 00:24:11,400
punish wait because we're a primer then

399
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,860
if you are wrong with the tries to wrap

400
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:16,860
the log before classes figure it and now

401
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:18,330
we're trying to run it from within the

402
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:21,750
excess so and what happens is it the

403
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:24,090
external receives a request of the whole

404
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:25,860
thing please read the links to the

405
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:28,560
triangles and then simply goes and

406
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,330
cracks it up because it was that's what

407
00:24:30,330 --> 00:24:32,370
it does for this is russ and then comes

408
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:34,980
into the driver to render it and then in

409
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:38,700
the eye barber will think that i need to

410
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:41,250
back it up before but the extra lonely

411
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:43,560
has a box so we have a recursive getting

412
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:48,150
up here because we try to run a crown on

413
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:51,960
their backs it up for example are so we

414
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:54,540
had to do some sun hanging on this and

415
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:58,860
then the similar way to do this is to

416
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:01,320
just see if you're a guest even the

417
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:04,170
person comes in and it turns out that

418
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:06,540
this is a three different then before

419
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:08,300
the garbage

420
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:10,880
quick just releasing our correlation

421
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,760
driver and now the dryer is a Democrat

422
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,680
adoptive endless and that will succeed

423
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:18,980
us he doesn't let go top so the driver

424
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:21,380
will be able to rent out what every

425
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:23,420
muscle in his release about and protect

426
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:25,670
the answers and the extra will then in

427
00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:28,910
easily retailer in case we were about to

428
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:31,610
do some to be rich so the acyl taking on

429
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:38,050
animation in da to look back to see so

430
00:25:38,050 --> 00:25:40,970
this is actually works very well means

431
00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:42,860
that I hope taking and repeating with

432
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:45,380
ours is not cheap because it's not the

433
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:47,780
same about himself about restoring the

434
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:49,670
state of the graduates have to be what

435
00:25:49,670 --> 00:25:51,530
makes server or the complete traffic

436
00:25:51,530 --> 00:25:54,860
lights but anything in the end there's

437
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:56,810
not much of a performance energy

438
00:25:56,810 --> 00:26:01,460
information here for their definitely it

439
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:09,110
should be efficient ok so the ticker

440
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:12,560
monroeville this is a big one of the big

441
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,360
article for doing this the big

442
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:18,530
motivation and and the thing is not a

443
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:20,840
necessity rather one in from within the

444
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:25,040
egg server memory and ever space we say

445
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:27,250
all right but they teach my parents here

446
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:30,110
because of the data business is an extra

447
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:31,049
body in this

448
00:26:31,049 --> 00:26:34,679
Taylor address space and now we have you

449
00:26:34,679 --> 00:26:36,539
the street in operating the expedited

450
00:26:36,539 --> 00:26:38,549
space too so we can say to the drive all

451
00:26:38,549 --> 00:26:40,470
right but these Peaks I've out here this

452
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:42,570
is your texture so that the

453
00:26:42,570 --> 00:26:45,600
implementation is valid or not because

454
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:51,840
ok we just part to that this map and it

455
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,759
doesn't almost way to do this is the

456
00:26:53,759 --> 00:26:55,799
best way to see if we have that picked

457
00:26:55,799 --> 00:26:59,460
up sitting in Indian River on the car so

458
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:01,919
intentionally that's what the XO agility

459
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:05,279
play the video may require a visa in an

460
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:08,340
ocular on the behavior and Su render

461
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:10,889
your lips and in the ratings whatever

462
00:27:10,889 --> 00:27:14,460
you do to this window that draw with

463
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:16,289
accumulated the home screen office

464
00:27:16,289 --> 00:27:18,330
immediately and then when you want to

465
00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:21,690
taste her we want to render and applying

466
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:23,940
a level to do safety for meditation we

467
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:26,489
have one two three then two then video

468
00:27:26,489 --> 00:27:28,320
area with the decline and you said

469
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:31,730
protect me so that's the ideal case but

470
00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:39,080
it doesn't work that way to them is that

471
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:43,019
initiation works but for now what we're

472
00:27:43,019 --> 00:27:45,269
doing is we will just add the extra

473
00:27:45,269 --> 00:27:47,100
logic to not do things you take that

474
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:49,350
time to minimize our interpreter in

475
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:53,460
whole story so whenever you usually do

476
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:57,539
your improving the overall this render

477
00:27:57,539 --> 00:27:59,669
any of this revelation emotion which

478
00:27:59,669 --> 00:28:05,730
Gregor and when we want to use it as a

479
00:28:05,730 --> 00:28:09,799
cetacean we do text to this

480
00:28:09,799 --> 00:28:14,519
area and the treatise txt downloads /

481
00:28:14,519 --> 00:28:16,620
may have set up the texture so we have

482
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:19,409
this Bank volcom host memories really

483
00:28:19,409 --> 00:28:22,379
love it all the time not bad for to go

484
00:28:22,379 --> 00:28:24,539
from pokering cover the intervening

485
00:28:24,539 --> 00:28:30,809
refund on every new option so that's

486
00:28:30,809 --> 00:28:33,210
that we're doing now is halogen biggest

487
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:36,210
component automation nvm compunctions

488
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:41,850
desktops it was unit today and in 1719

489
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:44,090
faced

490
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:04,020
ah

491
00:29:14,150 --> 00:29:20,450
and so they're the property with and

492
00:29:20,450 --> 00:29:22,130
this is it we would like to be able to

493
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:27,100
use the same on in the media room and

494
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:29,810
the same people be aware that EXO for

495
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:31,010
instance you would like to give to you

496
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:33,140
said protected without counting things

497
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:36,710
about okay do that right now because the

498
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:39,290
way the eggs are the main story is kind

499
00:29:39,290 --> 00:29:45,410
of open so we have video ever and what

500
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:48,290
happens test out of this set we take our

501
00:29:48,290 --> 00:29:50,810
memory for the framework so we do sell

502
00:29:50,810 --> 00:29:55,820
some of this video response rate then

503
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:58,850
what happens is that we have deriding

504
00:29:58,850 --> 00:30:00,740
which we split the rest of the numerator

505
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:04,430
to pass and the XR minus one half of the

506
00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:11,270
river another hazard do so so we had to

507
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:14,720
section of very angry move it around the

508
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:17,240
exodus extended theorize over the

509
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:20,420
drivers or sinus TX memory so the

510
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:22,730
problem is that will be related to two

511
00:30:22,730 --> 00:30:25,130
new pieces just picture related live in

512
00:30:25,130 --> 00:30:27,440
the extra half a gentleman and we want

513
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,720
to use it as a texture we really need to

514
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:32,930
be in the critical part of the video but

515
00:30:32,930 --> 00:30:37,690
it's over the last so we can't do that

516
00:30:37,690 --> 00:30:41,390
so what we like to do here is just have

517
00:30:41,390 --> 00:30:44,990
one figure of memory on the car and MN

518
00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:48,899
and this is what the work

519
00:30:48,899 --> 00:30:51,509
talking guys to do is worth doing it a

520
00:30:51,509 --> 00:30:54,149
colonel in there were men involved in

521
00:30:54,149 --> 00:30:56,580
the video memory so you can have your

522
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:59,399
very delicate objects in literally all

523
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:01,469
right visits of opera and EXO is going

524
00:31:01,469 --> 00:31:03,029
to rain doesn't stop into thinking it's

525
00:31:03,029 --> 00:31:06,149
a big mac and then laid on you as a

526
00:31:06,149 --> 00:31:09,239
device whether it's the texture and the

527
00:31:09,239 --> 00:31:11,580
do I don't use that same problem in the

528
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:14,909
cultures alert to take so then the work

529
00:31:14,909 --> 00:31:16,950
they do not allowed us to work if we can

530
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:19,830
head still employs take complete a quiz

531
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:26,059
you then get rid of the storm you see a

532
00:31:26,059 --> 00:31:32,099
company's composite s and the other

533
00:31:32,099 --> 00:31:35,989
thing is that we have some regression

534
00:31:35,989 --> 00:31:40,219
functionality so the way that is dead

535
00:31:40,219 --> 00:31:48,269
tari Renner works this is said and at

536
00:31:48,269 --> 00:31:54,659
the beginning talk then these outlaws

537
00:31:54,659 --> 00:31:57,330
man asked the xserver for the address of

538
00:31:57,330 --> 00:31:59,279
the paper and then it knows the gravel

539
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:02,429
and Venice strange their paper but if we

540
00:32:02,429 --> 00:32:04,409
want to get some positive yes it

541
00:32:04,409 --> 00:32:05,700
shouldn't be doing that it should be

542
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:08,659
very internet peaceful uses iphone

543
00:32:08,659 --> 00:32:11,460
window patterns but then the dark i do

544
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:13,799
not know about this and just premise it

545
00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:18,479
to power for my sis officer and it

546
00:32:18,479 --> 00:32:27,269
doesn't so no separate it looks like

547
00:32:27,269 --> 00:32:29,399
it's working this is the next is running

548
00:32:29,399 --> 00:32:31,979
it down removal that's what you may not

549
00:32:31,979 --> 00:32:33,779
remove the window run it is obvious that

550
00:32:33,779 --> 00:32:43,649
if that way and then we remove the sun

551
00:32:43,649 --> 00:32:47,429
is down DJ accountable and the thing is

552
00:32:47,429 --> 00:32:50,999
that copies does not any update the

553
00:32:50,999 --> 00:32:53,460
extras idea for the videos until you

554
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:55,919
give the window set us down we as always

555
00:32:55,919 --> 00:32:58,139
in sporting that this can we tell the

556
00:32:58,139 --> 00:33:00,629
air services oddly shape so it doesn't

557
00:33:00,629 --> 00:33:03,419
even try but the more you let it go its

558
00:33:03,419 --> 00:33:05,450
analysis all right i got an imposition

559
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:07,529
this is where you should be ready so

560
00:33:07,529 --> 00:33:10,799
it's only when actually has a decision

561
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:13,229
moves around another thing is that it

562
00:33:13,229 --> 00:33:24,570
doesn't respect it lists here promise i

563
00:33:24,570 --> 00:33:25,910
I think

564
00:33:25,910 --> 00:33:32,690
we have a the wiggle sketching is

565
00:33:32,690 --> 00:33:34,550
different because we have a big

566
00:33:34,550 --> 00:33:38,120
witnessing in front of them desta so now

567
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:40,760
this love these windows visible anyway

568
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:44,630
it in the exercise that we're sitting in

569
00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:47,660
front the copies does already over into

570
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:53,620
this window so we see the movie but the

571
00:33:56,290 --> 00:33:59,300
be again de la drivers from specialists

572
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:05,960
and ngos presence of a more so soon so

573
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:08,690
that's something interface what was soon

574
00:34:08,690 --> 00:34:11,540
would need to be here again ties into

575
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:16,790
the riverbed network because and we

576
00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:21,230
regroup tell me you could only be here

577
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:23,239
i'm proud to say wait after the famous

578
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:25,940
racketeer apology with a different

579
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:27,650
address and say this is where you should

580
00:34:27,650 --> 00:34:29,989
be regularly and then give it given the

581
00:34:29,989 --> 00:34:32,840
address of a nothing if not we do your

582
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,940
quantity relative but that's not what

583
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:38,179
problems to let it just so with the

584
00:34:38,179 --> 00:34:40,790
technical piece like i did we the way so

585
00:34:40,790 --> 00:34:42,409
till now we actually to have this

586
00:34:42,409 --> 00:34:45,350
contents in hopes terror but if we did

587
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:51,560
did it 400 it would end up in convenient

588
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:53,840
and so we couldn't easily use that we

589
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:56,659
leave a disturbance as a texture so so

590
00:34:56,659 --> 00:34:59,210
that open another thing is that even

591
00:34:59,210 --> 00:35:00,680
though when we look at the day with our

592
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:03,620
dinner with NBC we see this portrays a

593
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:05,720
tear or there's a concern or layers of

594
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:10,130
data Adams and O'Neil frames and like oh

595
00:35:10,130 --> 00:35:12,680
you can do chocolate operate which in

596
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:14,390
which case we run into the backbone and

597
00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:17,010
then when you say smoking pocket

598
00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:20,280
the back cover is the focus it also has

599
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:23,610
info us that that that drank some depth

600
00:35:23,610 --> 00:35:25,680
in pixels so that if you renders a new

601
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:28,500
peeps the name and that case is firm on

602
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:31,800
that piece of their already in cover but

603
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,480
if the peaceful nuclear energy on

604
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:35,940
Santorini Island you're just not okay

605
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:37,880
that people keep the old value in place

606
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:42,120
it's got other types of offers Stenson

607
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:44,670
buffers and then there is another

608
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:47,340
prophecy market commons allocate our

609
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:49,200
fifth child of the rate that same way

610
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:53,640
that we allocate from so so if we try to

611
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,700
drain into the spot where they they they

612
00:35:55,700 --> 00:36:00,480
still they didn't want they don't still

613
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,220
keep the rendering accountants the owner

614
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:04,560
pillows and one litter boxes known as

615
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:07,290
dedicated for for for sale attempt on a

616
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:10,440
double and the means that then 3d

617
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:12,960
remedies to know how to allocate or it

618
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,520
doesn't know if I now just take the

619
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:17,130
child out a big screens and bottom and

620
00:36:17,130 --> 00:36:21,120
then uses that so so with the memory

621
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:23,160
when their work the egg with the Dragon

622
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:25,740
will be able to clone and in the quest

623
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:28,110
and then he is powerful back offer of

624
00:36:28,110 --> 00:36:30,900
depth buffer and he can then set up and

625
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:31,650
went

626
00:36:31,650 --> 00:36:33,360
and also you think that's the same way

627
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:42,180
we do for regular and special needs we

628
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:43,980
have another apartment losses in Capri

629
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:50,850
narration and so so if we in da snow say

630
00:36:50,850 --> 00:37:02,550
case this is when their way by so I two

631
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:05,690
windows here and this is my laptop is a

632
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:10,370
1024 x 768 screams a lot of space

633
00:37:10,370 --> 00:37:13,950
between two minutes I I had to resize

634
00:37:13,950 --> 00:37:15,720
them and put the next to each other or I

635
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:18,150
can usually to sync up the feature of

636
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:20,910
Howdy's this will even throw a loss or

637
00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:24,030
mahogany before please get it down like

638
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:26,610
that and I get a view of all the words

639
00:37:26,610 --> 00:37:31,050
of a desktop but the xls know that the

640
00:37:31,050 --> 00:37:32,460
way that have been resized and moved

641
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:34,470
around like this extra the stupid the

642
00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:36,780
three windows of all this full screen

643
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:38,970
size and all the system talk each other

644
00:37:38,970 --> 00:37:43,860
so he if he might if I could clear his

645
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:50,010
widow the exhalation Linkletter the

646
00:37:50,010 --> 00:37:52,800
mouse cursor is up here in indy of a

647
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,740
power window even though it looks like

648
00:37:55,740 --> 00:38:01,050
it's almost in email you know what is

649
00:38:01,050 --> 00:38:04,170
the necklace text you i would be picking

650
00:38:04,170 --> 00:38:07,860
up here instead of someone close to them

651
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:10,110
so the departing it is that the Excel

652
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:11,430
does know that the windows if you move

653
00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:14,810
round and scale access so it is tries to

654
00:38:14,810 --> 00:38:17,270
english is the witness of collusion very

655
00:38:17,270 --> 00:38:21,410
thin design so in this case conscious is

656
00:38:21,410 --> 00:38:24,080
this clear to know about this because he

657
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:26,230
doesn't try to get me prank an icon

658
00:38:26,230 --> 00:38:30,410
they're like what would we usually you

659
00:38:30,410 --> 00:38:33,020
could rank pregnant item into this for

660
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:38,720
that I want to copy polygons but because

661
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,040
this doesn't let me do that because it

662
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:41,990
doesn't work so what are you still upset

663
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:44,540
I i can click on the window and select

664
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:47,920
the thing you should be focused and

665
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,240
that's sort of the limit of what you can

666
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,340
do and what happens is a counting

667
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:53,870
companies this drawing the window so

668
00:38:53,870 --> 00:38:55,280
comfy clothes that the windows epic

669
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:59,740
scale town to town and how these can can

670
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:02,750
highlight the windows move over with the

671
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:07,460
mouse but i had actually interact with

672
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:10,490
the winners of this thing so as you

673
00:39:10,490 --> 00:39:12,800
mentioned in your input we'd written

674
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:16,630
before that a method to take you next

675
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:19,760
the information instruct the extra-large

676
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:22,130
of back in with two windows so is this

677
00:39:22,130 --> 00:39:25,100
whether it is shown a way of an opponent

678
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:29,120
scale down the composite america for mix

679
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:33,050
on this by sending it as SL triangle

680
00:39:33,050 --> 00:39:35,090
that describes the relation between the

681
00:39:35,090 --> 00:39:37,490
winner is inexcusable screen how

682
00:39:37,490 --> 00:39:40,280
actually this objective so with that in

683
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:44,410
place we should be able to find again

684
00:39:44,410 --> 00:39:48,700
like how we want how does mean to me so

685
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:55,118
that you do I just left super them it's

686
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:01,960
Christmas

687
00:40:25,310 --> 00:40:33,270
yeah so so much space in town as support

688
00:40:33,270 --> 00:40:39,300
for repair windows with on here so with

689
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:43,560
with them regular eggs when the sweet we

690
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:48,510
can request a reversal officials and

691
00:40:48,510 --> 00:40:50,580
official is just data structure

692
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:54,240
describes how the pizza meal and window

693
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:56,970
is to be interrupted by later when it

694
00:40:56,970 --> 00:40:59,250
was impossible is not possible to say I

695
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:01,890
want to dress for visual that has an

696
00:41:01,890 --> 00:41:04,200
alpha channel so that not with the right

697
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:07,550
of being and when I sweet vs. business

698
00:41:07,550 --> 00:41:10,170
transparency of pizza and then you can

699
00:41:10,170 --> 00:41:14,550
use this tool to make clocks or window

700
00:41:14,550 --> 00:41:18,810
like this the shape and then so what you

701
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:21,630
can out of this half is for you aight

702
00:41:21,630 --> 00:41:24,030
you can't see anything through this but

703
00:41:24,030 --> 00:41:26,180
in this case we have this is slightly

704
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:28,470
translucent you can see the folder on

705
00:41:28,470 --> 00:41:31,680
the desktop can over here so you can do

706
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:35,790
this for regular x applications but you

707
00:41:35,790 --> 00:41:38,400
want to use an open here education and

708
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:43,250
specify that you want a relationship e

709
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:47,280
opengl application let's we don't lose

710
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:52,280
all that but i don't think it would be a

711
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:54,960
proper training with this if we vary

712
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:57,990
native with the next 15 to american

713
00:41:57,990 --> 00:42:00,690
render and image that has the alpha

714
00:42:00,690 --> 00:42:04,300
values ahead suppose

715
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:07,150
because we just mostly have Queen

716
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:11,500
recovering and can provide alpha that is

717
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:13,900
pleased peacing it is basically just

718
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:29,350
work I don't some yeah it XP is about

719
00:42:29,350 --> 00:42:33,070
regression that that we introduced with

720
00:42:33,070 --> 00:42:35,380
their for muscle and because it's me

721
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:38,560
uses it it is a different story but in

722
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:41,220
the detection simple if you put in HD

723
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:43,840
and the desktop we shall move your arm

724
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:46,240
you see that the video is implicit

725
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:49,300
correct and then this is again that

726
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:51,550
vehicle e-except amuses in feature of

727
00:42:51,550 --> 00:42:54,070
the outlet at last opportunity in house

728
00:42:54,070 --> 00:42:56,260
based operation and it uses a color

729
00:42:56,260 --> 00:42:59,200
keyed I indicate on the screen where it

730
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:02,950
should be the video solvation hidden

731
00:43:02,950 --> 00:43:06,100
kitchen from reebok anything with as you

732
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:09,330
probably know and moved around their

733
00:43:09,330 --> 00:43:12,760
descriptions of each other half of a

734
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:16,540
group they come to the competition today

735
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:22,200
and then the summer can only be like so

736
00:43:23,009 --> 00:43:25,269
and as you moved around you don't

737
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:27,489
actually update that physicians & albert

738
00:43:27,489 --> 00:43:29,919
and you cooked it it was still go to

739
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:33,579
transform us with us so to get that work

740
00:43:33,579 --> 00:43:39,159
we probably need to use over here and I

741
00:43:39,159 --> 00:43:41,799
know their game from has done some work

742
00:43:41,799 --> 00:43:45,400
in this area and jamie has something in

743
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:50,529
his HTM swimmers from the Justice but a

744
00:43:50,529 --> 00:43:57,779
alex is still there and that's something

745
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:12,560
let's go if i buy us anything yet let us

746
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:14,540
that still slow the net net net falls

747
00:44:14,540 --> 00:44:16,340
down to the way we do the texture of

748
00:44:16,340 --> 00:44:18,680
this crap the implications does and the

749
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:21,230
external vendors like the window family

750
00:44:21,230 --> 00:44:22,790
to host memory so when you're snorting

751
00:44:22,790 --> 00:44:25,850
on firefox what nobody will find what we

752
00:44:25,850 --> 00:44:27,560
do to disclose right now is it would ask

753
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:30,650
the excellent to copy the area of 10

754
00:44:30,650 --> 00:44:32,960
pics with our watches going and then

755
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:34,490
five us will remember that stripper yeah

756
00:44:34,490 --> 00:44:37,550
but what we do now is we really eczema

757
00:44:37,550 --> 00:44:40,790
has been instructed to do this posted so

758
00:44:40,790 --> 00:44:44,000
this wrote to his mother now is it then

759
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,520
copy it also to cover the lives up in

760
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:48,980
place and then it goes and raises for

761
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:51,590
this up and in for Paul takes brendan is

762
00:44:51,590 --> 00:44:56,000
upset you want to community meeting

763
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,730
characters into the Gamma Rho bo staffs

764
00:44:58,730 --> 00:45:00,890
are you consider it is compositing into

765
00:45:00,890 --> 00:45:03,170
the this case we fall back to

766
00:45:03,170 --> 00:45:06,340
software to so we have composite they

767
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:10,220
will inherit and suffer so this is so

768
00:45:10,220 --> 00:45:12,740
then once we've done that gets the cover

769
00:45:12,740 --> 00:45:15,410
that entire from algorithm which in the

770
00:45:15,410 --> 00:45:19,220
texture to bring up then you pray on the

771
00:45:19,220 --> 00:45:21,830
screen so that that's a big public right

772
00:45:21,830 --> 00:45:23,960
now God hopefully if we once the

773
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:25,820
government in some cases we can be handy

774
00:45:25,820 --> 00:45:29,470
has rendered into one period of objects

775
00:45:29,470 --> 00:45:32,810
we thank you we use an optical mixer in

776
00:45:32,810 --> 00:45:35,720
it food is like you want

777
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:52,740
excellent so that's the resizing yeah

778
00:45:52,740 --> 00:45:55,470
that that's more involved if it really

779
00:45:55,470 --> 00:45:59,720
comes down to then some educational

780
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:08,880
resources and have a lot more practice

781
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:17,670
emoji we definitely need and a ton of

782
00:46:17,670 --> 00:46:19,260
things are interesting that we do the

783
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:20,359
deposit

784
00:46:20,359 --> 00:46:22,220
actually synchronize the recycler

785
00:46:22,220 --> 00:46:24,049
between the educational interventions

786
00:46:24,049 --> 00:46:25,940
before for those westernization you

787
00:46:25,940 --> 00:46:27,890
resize video and the application would

788
00:46:27,890 --> 00:46:31,059
get another piece activating try combo

789
00:46:31,059 --> 00:46:36,650
and you get these half-breeds out the

790
00:46:36,650 --> 00:46:39,970
window and once it
