1
00:00:18,939 --> 00:00:25,810
talk about to the view the situation yet

2
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:39,670
hey trees we're ready so when you talk

3
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:42,910
about securing secure communications my

4
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:45,520
name's Peter sent on pay but I don't

5
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,920
speak any French st. Peter at every

6
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,129
organ is my email whatever and

7
00:00:51,129 --> 00:00:52,900
everything I always say is in the public

8
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:55,110
domain so none of this copyright garbage

9
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:57,640
here talk about student communications

10
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:00,309
with Jabbar so what's the status of this

11
00:01:00,309 --> 00:01:02,590
is a very brief overview it said mobile

12
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:04,479
technologies for real-time messaging

13
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:08,020
presents multimedia negotiation and more

14
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:10,119
it's really just an XML router it was

15
00:01:10,119 --> 00:01:13,090
invented by every Miller in 1998 its

16
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:14,920
power breastfeeding XML which is kind of

17
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:17,680
bizarre concept but you know Tim rated

18
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,780
might hit but it works very well for us

19
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:23,200
so we send streaming xml / long with TCP

20
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,970
connections essentially just open tcp

21
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:27,190
socket and you need to mentally parse

22
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:29,920
XML when you can do generally that's the

23
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,200
short version so we have a client-server

24
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,830
architecture which enables

25
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:35,960
the decentralized network greater domain

26
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:38,600
messaging it's basically like email but

27
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:41,840
really fast with built-in presence but

28
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,580
it's not following source project divers

29
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:45,380
get different from something like Apache

30
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:50,240
or Linux multiple code bases there's

31
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,860
open source code there's commercial code

32
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:53,570
this year where it is free where there's

33
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:54,860
all sorts of different kinds of code

34
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:56,480
that we have because we really focus on

35
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:00,200
the protocol not the NOC code base so

36
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,780
our court protocol has been standardized

37
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:05,060
to the IETF non-final standard but we're

38
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:07,220
working through my own standardization

39
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:08,750
of that with the internet engineering

40
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:11,750
task force when we took that they're

41
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:13,190
waiting call jabbering called the

42
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:14,570
extensible messaging and presence

43
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:17,000
protocol or executi because you need a

44
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,570
4-letter acronym for all good protocols

45
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:23,330
let's define an RFC 39 20 and 30 and 21

46
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:25,130
I wrote those and I don't suggest that

47
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:26,990
the right artsy's unless they have dead

48
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:29,690
fish but it's been widely deployed how

49
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:31,220
many users do we have what we really

50
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:32,720
don't know big decentralized

51
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,100
architecture we don't keep track of

52
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:35,990
these download the servers and how many

53
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:37,970
people are using this stuff we ask them

54
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:40,790
it is about 50 million Jews that's

55
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:42,530
princeton st there's a lot of other

56
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:43,629
stuff

57
00:02:43,629 --> 00:02:46,010
because it's not just hide em its

58
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:48,230
general xml grounding essentially so

59
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:50,180
there are lots of applications beyond IM

60
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:51,920
and we're continually defining

61
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,720
extensions to the court protocol but we

62
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,250
don't do all those all in the IDF

63
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:57,260
because we have done an abandoned and

64
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,510
potatoes too long so we find us in

65
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:01,099
something called the action 50 standards

66
00:03:01,099 --> 00:03:03,110
foundation which until recently we call

67
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:04,730
the javits software foundation but we

68
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:06,590
never get any software so we decided to

69
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:08,330
change name can more accurately describe

70
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:11,269
what we were doing so that's great right

71
00:03:11,269 --> 00:03:13,700
you have 50 million users big deal but

72
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,799
how secure is it which I've got 50

73
00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:17,810
million people sending unsecured

74
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:19,280
messages it's not really a good thing

75
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,989
we're actually maybe harming the

76
00:03:20,989 --> 00:03:23,660
internet or more healthier and we wanted

77
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:25,250
a good internet citizen so what is

78
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:27,380
security well there's a lot of

79
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:28,910
definition so I thought let's visualize

80
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:30,799
what is the secure commerce ation in

81
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:33,739
real life because we have these are the

82
00:03:33,739 --> 00:03:35,599
analogies that we can use to figure out

83
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:38,720
what security on the internet let's see

84
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,750
a good friend over to visit your home

85
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:43,849
it's your house right you know each

86
00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:45,860
other you trust each other he's probably

87
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:48,319
not wearing some recording device figure

88
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:50,060
out but you know take this home and

89
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:52,750
posted on the internet when he gets home

90
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:55,160
it's only the two of you right there's

91
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,720
no people listening indeed you've got

92
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,450
someone else

93
00:03:57,450 --> 00:04:00,390
close window right strangers can enter

94
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:02,220
your home like they can on the Internet

95
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:04,950
intervene in these types of things your

96
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:07,200
home is involved too old you know maybe

97
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,440
check the rooms or bugs before you start

98
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,970
to have your computation the

99
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:13,680
conversation is not recorded you're not

100
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,450
recording at your friends not recording

101
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:17,010
that what you say is private and

102
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:19,079
confidential all right if you take a

103
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:21,238
walk on the hike in the mountains or you

104
00:04:21,238 --> 00:04:22,740
have someone over to your house this is

105
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,810
an assumption that you have a secular

106
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:27,200
conversation is private and confidential

107
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:30,389
contrast this with the internet the

108
00:04:30,389 --> 00:04:32,310
Internet is a dangerous place don't use

109
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:35,070
the internet there are lots of potential

110
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:37,800
attacks right we have been the middle

111
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,750
they have been authenticated users we

112
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,460
have address spoofing we've got weak

113
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:44,330
identity Road servers denial of service

114
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:47,010
directory harvesting buffer overflows

115
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:50,010
and various code bases spam spins bits

116
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:53,010
blogs there's all these nasty things

117
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:54,900
that can happen to it goes on and on

118
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:58,110
this viruses and worms Trojans malware

119
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:00,389
fishing and farming you have to come up

120
00:05:00,389 --> 00:05:01,800
with the term for this stuff all the

121
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,870
time because the Internet

122
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:04,940
that's a nasty place you put a machine

123
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:06,440
on the internet to see how long it takes

124
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,660
to get attacked right this information

125
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:10,550
leaks is people why do things you don't

126
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:14,420
want them to log them and so so how do

127
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:15,770
we fight these threats in the jabber

128
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:18,410
community well I have to first apologize

129
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:22,240
but Deborah is not a perfect technology

130
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,620
it was not originally built for high

131
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:27,560
security it was written built by hackers

132
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,910
who said hey let's get something working

133
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:30,530
you know we don't like game you know my

134
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:32,270
guy CQ let's build something that's a

135
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:34,190
real technology that we can develop

136
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:36,020
ourselves to not be bubbled into these

137
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:38,000
large corporations typical American

138
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,590
operations I'm American so we don't

139
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:45,890
require jejeje we don't require x509 we

140
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:47,930
don't require ubiquitous encryption it's

141
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:50,120
not silk it's not much mail it's a very

142
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:53,150
open technology that's why we have if

143
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:54,890
you don't users how many people areas

144
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:56,570
the silk and hushmail these kinds of

145
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:58,540
technology it's not 15 million mo big

146
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:00,710
but privacy and security have always

147
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:02,450
been very important to our community and

148
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:04,490
even though we haven't necessarily done

149
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:06,290
a great job with bad leader is time

150
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:08,450
would have approved so what have we done

151
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:10,010
to help well let's look at the gyro

152
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:11,410
architecture hey this looks familiar

153
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:15,590
clients and servers right oops it's a

154
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:16,820
client-server our place or somewhere

155
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:19,430
deep in so client connects on the TCP

156
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:25,340
connection sockets 552 or we have HTTP

157
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:27,370
or SSL

158
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:31,030
is a tcp connection device 22 which if

159
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:32,740
you don't want to do data communications

160
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:34,930
you can close off that port and off we

161
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:37,510
go the client must authenticate you

162
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:38,710
don't have any of this you know

163
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:40,540
medication is optional like it happens

164
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:42,160
if itself like that original

165
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,320
technologies those plaintext effort

166
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,870
obviously not very good idea but I still

167
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:49,180
do it with the telnet client that I use

168
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:51,070
if i connect on the same subnet I don't

169
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:52,930
worry about it too much a hashed

170
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:55,030
password which is the other early

171
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:56,380
technique that we had then we went to

172
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:57,760
thanks to the internet engineering task

173
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,860
force to say hey we've had this great

174
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:02,169
technology called sassa simple

175
00:07:02,169 --> 00:07:03,789
authentication and security later and it

176
00:07:03,789 --> 00:07:05,440
has all sorts of mechanisms it's in

177
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:10,060
defining RC 4422 ds3 2222 so there are

178
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:11,860
many sasso mechanisms you can complain

179
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:14,460
which is okay we've got a ssl encrypted

180
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:18,160
connection Dinah 75 you know some people

181
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,639
like that some people don't this bearing

182
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:23,229
philosophies on that external so if

183
00:07:23,229 --> 00:07:26,020
you're using x509 or IP stack or

184
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:27,400
something like that you can assess of

185
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:30,070
external Kerberos is a lot of recognized

186
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:33,220
at MIT who have a new scabbard they do

187
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:35,139
Supercross some of the

188
00:07:35,139 --> 00:07:36,780
Lester Bangs these other people

189
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:39,189
excessive amounts owing that anonymous

190
00:07:39,189 --> 00:07:44,110
users maybe support you know a technical

191
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:45,819
support kind of application and so on

192
00:07:45,819 --> 00:07:47,529
this level so all of our users not

193
00:07:47,529 --> 00:07:50,590
authenticated and the server asserts

194
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:52,659
what the from address a so you can't say

195
00:07:52,659 --> 00:07:55,810
oh I'm service at PayPal com it just

196
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:57,189
doesn't work because the server is going

197
00:07:57,189 --> 00:07:58,719
to say no you are on the server tell

198
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:00,849
them informs other people what defender

199
00:08:00,849 --> 00:08:02,349
addresses so you can't just assert that

200
00:08:02,349 --> 00:08:04,090
you want to be a certain person in

201
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:07,120
general so are these Japanese me quite

202
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,979
clever logical addresses they look like

203
00:08:08,979 --> 00:08:10,960
email addresses Iowa's News of

204
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,300
Shakespeare examples Romeo at Montague

205
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:16,719
and Juliet Capulet calm you know bar to

206
00:08:16,719 --> 00:08:18,370
chase your doublet these kinds of things

207
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:20,439
but they're not limited to us ask the

208
00:08:20,439 --> 00:08:22,590
character so unlike email you can have

209
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:26,289
yet to conduct CC and you can add

210
00:08:26,289 --> 00:08:28,990
play-doh and tell us gr and you can have

211
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:31,300
Thai addresses and Japanese addresses

212
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:32,740
and these will work you can have been to

213
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:35,708
domain name to it 28 to confuse the

214
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:38,860
possibilities open today

215
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:41,630
and you see people jabber addresses like

216
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:44,000
this is pretty cool so we have a full

217
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,520
year ago but it's good an attempt has

218
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,870
now you can have some nice phishing

219
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:50,510
attacks for instance my address is st.

220
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:53,300
Peter tire rubber what's the ill it does

221
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,920
aunt Tilly really know that this one of

222
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,690
the bottom uses Cherokee characters

223
00:08:56,690 --> 00:08:59,150
instead of asking characters probably

224
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:01,520
not so she said oh this looks like my

225
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,230
friend Safety Director work but it ain't

226
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:05,990
it's someone else so the clients to

227
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:07,310
choose tech names and things like this

228
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:09,140
for tardy around some of the possible

229
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:10,640
phishing attacks we haven't seen these

230
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,000
happen but we need to be prepared so

231
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,260
these can all get store in your buddy

232
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:17,480
list buddy list is trademarked term from

233
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:20,840
a well so I don't typically use it we

234
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:23,030
call it a roster together to the surface

235
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:25,400
for a roster so that when connecting

236
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,410
various clients it's all there for you

237
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:28,700
you don't have the story when you're

238
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:31,310
goofy and the server broadcaster

239
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:33,020
presents are your availability so once

240
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:35,300
you get on behind you can say hey

241
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:39,550
everyone that I care about Here I am

242
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:42,279
Oh mrs. Cole presence but the server

243
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:44,050
only senses the people are authorized

244
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:45,880
there are some instant messaging

245
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,529
consumers and veteran systems out there

246
00:09:47,529 --> 00:09:49,450
which will give your presence away to

247
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:51,010
anyone which is really not such a good

248
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:53,260
idea we don't do the things that way the

249
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:55,240
server also must not expose your IP

250
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,160
address on like something like IRC where

251
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,720
your blog entire team room and everyone

252
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,910
knows what IP addresses good enough such

253
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:03,670
a nice connector almost of the track

254
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:05,800
doesn't server we disappear yourself we

255
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,480
actually have a server us know that one

256
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,149
laptop per five people are going to use

257
00:10:09,149 --> 00:10:11,920
but most traffic typically typical

258
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,720
implementations and deployments goes to

259
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:17,529
the server traffic is pure XML and the

260
00:10:17,529 --> 00:10:19,600
server's reject a malformed XML so this

261
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,060
is you know India validate even against

262
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:23,500
the schemas that they want typically

263
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,390
people don't do that but at the least

264
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:27,910
reach Africa well formulas this makes it

265
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:29,890
difficult to inject i nary objects

266
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:34,180
difficult to propagate malware in part

267
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:35,500
where this helps us do is break the

268
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,329
alliance between the virus writers in

269
00:10:37,329 --> 00:10:38,860
this manners there's a live action

270
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:40,240
service

271
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,860
15 of the virus writer for this manner

272
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:43,600
and he got won't quite well because

273
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,790
they're all trying to harm us in various

274
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:48,070
different ways so we basically don't

275
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:50,320
have what's called spin which is family

276
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,500
Brian yeah then this pic which is Stan

277
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:56,020
Wawrinka Internet telephony and a real

278
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:58,060
notes blogs of course expand their

279
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:00,790
family box we basically don't ask them

280
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:02,770
i'm on to say that we don't have any i

281
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:05,260
mean i've been using jabber since 1999 I

282
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:08,230
don't have ever received any spam except

283
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:10,779
when I was naked ice cube over the

284
00:11:10,779 --> 00:11:13,330
various databases that we have but I'm

285
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:15,910
not to say they don't have it so why is

286
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:17,050
that well it's hard to scoop the

287
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:19,390
addresses it's hard to send this in line

288
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:21,310
binary stuff that you know something get

289
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:23,260
in each family time now so to get around

290
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:27,580
need basic filters we have a ACA XHTML

291
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:30,370
subset which is kind of a safe such as

292
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:33,459
HTML that we can do formatted messages

293
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:35,830
but not send scripts and images these

294
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:38,380
kind of things the clients are very much

295
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:40,600
encouraged to check with the user before

296
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,810
accepting any file transfers on let's

297
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:45,490
say we're loose them but we have lost

298
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:47,630
and frightened tools

299
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:50,300
working on that we should have ready in

300
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:51,740
time before the spammers really

301
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:54,560
discoveries for instance we connected a

302
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,360
challenge response to figure out

303
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:59,390
something to spot versus a person or

304
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:01,640
before you registered account and we're

305
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,470
working on a quick wasted reports them

306
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:05,900
to your server and your servers reports

307
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,400
of each other and we can figure out

308
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,770
their Road servers on the Internet we

309
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:11,860
may even work on reputation systems

310
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:14,810
farther down the line and the skimmer is

311
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:16,340
one thing they need to do is overcome

312
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:18,800
great no need Zoe we limit the amount of

313
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,300
packets that you can send to the server

314
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:22,280
this is what most of the servers are

315
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,590
written to try to prevent wrote clients

316
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:28,910
from connecting to legitimate servers so

317
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:31,070
if you really want to get serious about

318
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:33,710
spending the jabber network you don't

319
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:35,900
have to launch a rogue server but you

320
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:37,700
get discovered pretty quickly because we

321
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:41,330
you know check out from addresses or you

322
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:43,910
left to launch a distributed pack so get

323
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:46,010
a lot of different box connect into

324
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:48,140
various different servers and have

325
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:50,450
nothing that you can get under the great

326
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:52,910
money and sending us fans really big

327
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:55,310
worth the bottle not impossible is just

328
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:57,950
harder than other networks but got in

329
00:12:57,950 --> 00:12:59,900
the mail might as well technically on

330
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,370
the structure first collaborative

331
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:04,340
circles just footage of pain and we

332
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:05,970
don't really have any road server

333
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:07,439
but if we do we're going to figure out

334
00:13:07,439 --> 00:13:10,100
ways to tell each other that they exist

335
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:12,810
so server Federation's by which I mean

336
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:14,970
inter-domain communication is optional

337
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:17,069
we have when I said that 50 million

338
00:13:17,069 --> 00:13:18,899
users those are not all users on the

339
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:20,730
open Internet in fact a lot of people

340
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:24,720
use jabber at universities or companies

341
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,220
and they don't connect aggressive the

342
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:27,870
network which is just fine they're using

343
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:29,310
our technology where they want to use it

344
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:32,009
we don't have any problem so that server

345
00:13:32,009 --> 00:13:33,839
Federation is on there many private

346
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:36,629
executi servers out there public service

347
00:13:36,629 --> 00:13:38,939
that rate on a different port so if they

348
00:13:38,939 --> 00:13:40,680
want to do federation they open up sec

349
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,329
report from the client communication

350
00:13:42,329 --> 00:13:46,350
which is 5269 DNS hooked up so we knew

351
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:48,509
dns lookups to determine IP addresses

352
00:13:48,509 --> 00:13:50,370
obviously me and has to be poison so

353
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:52,470
talk about that as well there's only one

354
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:55,319
hop between servers so I my email where

355
00:13:55,319 --> 00:13:57,449
this for this best death of delivery all

356
00:13:57,449 --> 00:13:59,279
I get it part of the way was another

357
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:02,370
server in between we only have one hop

358
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:05,069
between the servers which is that

359
00:14:05,069 --> 00:14:07,740
correct sir conservative connection when

360
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:09,600
certain identities are validated we have

361
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,279
come listen to the first way that we

362
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:13,829
have a surfer dial back which we bista

363
00:14:13,829 --> 00:14:15,809
tune in in two thousand so then the

364
00:14:15,809 --> 00:14:18,120
total october two thousand you can still

365
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,730
spoof server domains on jabber and it

366
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:22,259
was a bad things that we got rid of that

367
00:14:22,259 --> 00:14:24,180
and we said you can't connect the old

368
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:26,339
way this is ancient history for Jabbar

369
00:14:26,339 --> 00:14:27,899
by the way we've been around since

370
00:14:27,899 --> 00:14:30,389
nineteen on so so we can reverse the end

371
00:14:30,389 --> 00:14:32,279
that's the NS products if you tell me

372
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:33,750
that you're costing the door i say

373
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:34,370
that's

374
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:35,990
thank you very much for saying that

375
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:37,880
awesome that work let me check into the

376
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:40,100
emergency phone from the grill God we're

377
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:42,350
really is i checked to that IP address i

378
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:43,910
say how about this connection over here

379
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:45,800
who says he's boss bend over all right

380
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:48,080
is everybody through and I ditch the

381
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,029
keys that had passed back and forth and

382
00:14:50,029 --> 00:14:51,950
then you check whether the server really

383
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:53,390
is possible that organ if I got back

384
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:55,310
from the authoritative server then I

385
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:56,839
tell this connection oh that's you know

386
00:14:56,839 --> 00:14:59,360
your European and if I don't get back to

387
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,940
my key I say sorry Abed closest

388
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:05,240
connection so this effectively prevent

389
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:08,420
server spoofing and the reserve a

390
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:10,700
preceding server once that connection is

391
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:13,010
open now checks the sending domain on

392
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:15,440
every packet and so if the server's was

393
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,660
lost on the work and now it must said it

394
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:20,750
paypal Debra Debra which is neat over

395
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,310
here is going to say no I'm going to be

396
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:23,690
deck that packet about those that

397
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:24,890
connection because you're trying to do

398
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:27,380
the wrong thing so basically we have no

399
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:30,050
none of these messages from people who

400
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:32,450
are not who they say that we validate

401
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:34,880
all the identities on the network now

402
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,250
obviously if you do DNS poisoning you

403
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:39,410
can invalidate this Pacific poison dns

404
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:41,900
you can get Devon results right so if we

405
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:44,000
need something stronger we use something

406
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,890
called transport layer security which is

407
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:50,120
RFC 43 46 which is the IETF upgrade ssl

408
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:52,279
so this enables us with the channel

409
00:15:52,279 --> 00:15:54,170
encryption and if you use channel

410
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:56,450
encryption with TLS and certificates and

411
00:15:56,450 --> 00:15:58,750
you refer to this as

412
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:01,270
you can really tell if someone is well

413
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:03,130
now there's still may be some problems

414
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:05,370
and some people just direct IP IP

415
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:07,630
connection for server server we really

416
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:09,820
care about it so this enables us to do

417
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:11,980
strong medications other servers but

418
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:13,570
only if you're not using self-signed

419
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:15,190
certificates degrees and sell sorry

420
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:16,960
Emily do a self-signed certificates

421
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:19,150
totally meaningless the problem with

422
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:22,270
this as usual gets back to money these

423
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:23,830
are dollars the addition of these zeros

424
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:27,760
here so real I x.509 certificates are

425
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,800
expensive how many people here are going

426
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,930
to go to the very embarrassing or

427
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:34,210
thoughts and I've got by a lil

428
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:35,680
certificate for their jabber server

429
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,360
they're probably not because we're just

430
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,620
a bunch of hackers we don't have this

431
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:41,110
kind of money so what we want is free

432
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:43,360
digital certificates right free is good

433
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:47,800
free is free beer for FX PT server

434
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:50,080
admins so what we've done is we set up

435
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,420
an intermediate certification Authority

436
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:54,850
for the janitor network and that's a

437
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:58,060
texan feet up net so our root CA start

438
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:01,660
drama which is a CA based in Israel and

439
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:03,430
then we set ourselves up as an

440
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:04,990
intermediate certification Authority

441
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:07,180
through start from to offer free digital

442
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:09,790
certificates in jeopardy server admins

443
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:11,890
so if you have a jabber server you want

444
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:13,660
to free certificate just come to us and

445
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:15,970
we have Prix circuit circuit this is

446
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:18,190
really encourages people to do

447
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:20,589
I'm talent perfect so hopefully it will

448
00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:22,030
work without this case in the future our

449
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:24,430
guns amor a shirt and you can do

450
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:27,760
the ca search grab as well because I

451
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,020
work with those folks to get the edge of

452
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:31,120
the key supporting their so this

453
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,680
basically main channel encryption a

454
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:35,770
no-brainer and we have you should buy

455
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:37,660
then you're really trying to work out so

456
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:40,420
that we have mostly ubiquitous channel

457
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:42,370
encryption both server server client to

458
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:45,580
server so this really causes problems

459
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:47,590
for Mallory hunters remember your

460
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:49,780
security characters Mallory's the man in

461
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:51,580
the middle right so if i have my client

462
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:53,920
and the server i want to have connect to

463
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:57,580
my server Mallory is now boil but it

464
00:17:57,580 --> 00:17:59,020
doesn't really help us with Isaac

465
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:03,940
adjustment Isaac is your ISP and justin

466
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:07,450
is the justice system so you're is

467
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:09,040
thinking solely listening to this

468
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,240
traffic even though you have been

469
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,680
terrific connection between the client

470
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:14,410
and server is now unencrypted it's clear

471
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:16,750
text while it's inside that server

472
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,520
applications for the pocket of yours

473
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,080
Isaac could be listening in to

474
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,490
everything that you're saying because

475
00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:23,440
these are I speak and maybe Isaac his

476
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,120
friends adjustment and Justin wants to

477
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,520
know what's going on as well right so it

478
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,560
doesn't really help to have your big

479
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:33,130
risk channeling if within the server

480
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:35,650
applications we have a clear decks so we

481
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:37,540
need an end-to-end encryption or what we

482
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:41,200
call einai and we had Mary's pet to this

483
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,779
because we're not security

484
00:18:44,779 --> 00:18:48,000
sometimes different advice about how we

485
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,710
should be perceived the first way we did

486
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:52,230
this was open PCP we have a series of

487
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:54,899
documents concepts this was def 27

488
00:18:54,899 --> 00:18:57,059
exactly we had this very ergonomic our

489
00:18:57,059 --> 00:18:59,759
community to use of PGD to encrypt our

490
00:18:59,759 --> 00:19:03,029
packets that we send for full encryption

491
00:19:03,029 --> 00:19:06,169
and and this is great for keeps right

492
00:19:06,169 --> 00:19:10,080
how many people here whose openpgp gbg

493
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,419
something like that right c-rob on right

494
00:19:12,419 --> 00:19:14,580
or what techniques we use this stuff but

495
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:17,279
aunt Tilly does not use PGP and she's

496
00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:19,679
never will right she seriously lady that

497
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,539
Aunt Polly but she's just not ocean

498
00:19:21,539 --> 00:19:23,700
that's not very technically savvy so

499
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,649
then we said our second target took our

500
00:19:25,649 --> 00:19:27,600
stuff to the idea and the ice gets it

501
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,120
off you want to use these if you need to

502
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:33,179
use decimal now s1 was great technology

503
00:19:33,179 --> 00:19:35,250
but there are Marcus mine communications

504
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:37,289
dog out there than there are SMS

505
00:19:37,289 --> 00:19:39,299
lammps-users me how many people over

506
00:19:39,299 --> 00:19:41,179
there signing that email with a smile

507
00:19:41,179 --> 00:19:44,039
all right this three or four of us yeah

508
00:19:44,039 --> 00:19:48,059
I do that right but it's great for geeks

509
00:19:48,059 --> 00:19:51,179
and even the eater are using it right

510
00:19:51,179 --> 00:19:53,220
and it's great for summer toys because

511
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:55,110
there are some companies that get a

512
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:57,480
smart card or you have in the u.s. army

513
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:00,059
to add these cat cards and you just slip

514
00:20:00,059 --> 00:20:01,769
it into a machine and you're all your

515
00:20:01,769 --> 00:20:02,860
credentials are there

516
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:05,470
online but they had control over their

517
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:07,480
user base so they can tell them that you

518
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,429
need to use this card also taking on the

519
00:20:09,429 --> 00:20:12,400
network but again Angeline's is not use

520
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,220
x509 and she had a role she probably

521
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:18,100
more likely you could do what about

522
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:19,870
hexanol encryption of digital signatures

523
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:22,179
well it may seem like natural thing but

524
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:23,860
there really is not that much gold or

525
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:24,970
interest in this got the

526
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:28,570
canonicalization what you see 14 n it's

527
00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:31,420
really no one and it doesn't provide

528
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:33,190
what we call perfect forward secrecy so

529
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:35,860
here if you're kezia compromised someone

530
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:37,000
can go back and read all your all

531
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,559
vessels which we really don't think

532
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:41,590
that's such a good thing so then there's

533
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:42,790
something called off the record

534
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:44,410
communications i love how many people

535
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:46,960
use game or ATM right and you have off

536
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,850
the record communications it's really

537
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:50,650
cool it's a great idea it's

538
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:53,080
opportunistic encryption something like

539
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:55,419
ssh right so you get to keep once and

540
00:20:55,419 --> 00:20:57,640
then once you once you connect over ssh

541
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,950
again as long as the keys the same we

542
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:01,720
figure it's okay now someone would have

543
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,250
to attack that first connection and

544
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:06,429
attack the future connection but if once

545
00:21:06,429 --> 00:21:07,600
you've accepted that came from your

546
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,549
server on acetate you're pretty much

547
00:21:09,549 --> 00:21:12,460
happy right so that provides perfect for

548
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:14,830
a secret to do PR technology but it

549
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:18,070
encrypts only the message body so if you

550
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:20,780
say it's not because too high it doesn't

551
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:23,840
else to the packet we need to encrypt

552
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,510
the entire packet why is that well but

553
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:28,700
federal more than I am we're not to send

554
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:30,800
a coupla messages around percentage so

555
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:33,020
before sending forms that might have

556
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:34,730
sensitive data in and workflow

557
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:36,950
applications we might want to protect

558
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:38,870
the IP addresses that we sent in a

559
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:40,940
multimedia negotiation because we don't

560
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:44,300
want to suppose IP addresses so we have

561
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:46,040
been working for a while on technology

562
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:48,080
called encrypted sessions has a very

563
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,730
large set of requirements that sounds

564
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:51,620
great would be impossible to meet but ok

565
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:53,810
our current speed Senate Lee and tweak

566
00:21:53,810 --> 00:21:56,020
how that works and followed some other

567
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:58,190
technologies that were providing in

568
00:21:58,190 --> 00:22:00,560
paterson on this and a guy named Dave

569
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:02,870
Smith who sort of started all rolling so

570
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:04,520
the packets are confidential right we

571
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:06,080
don't want anyone to be able to read

572
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,650
things in transit even Isaac congestion

573
00:22:08,650 --> 00:22:10,760
need to know if there's a package that

574
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:13,910
we can feel it says integrity we need to

575
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:15,860
know as sub packages reclaim so someone

576
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:17,650
sent us the same packet again

577
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:20,230
foil our addiction Technology the

578
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:22,120
compromise of the keys does not reveal

579
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,800
the past communications that's perfect

580
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,320
for things we don't want to penalty

581
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:28,660
because no people don't use DJ I think I

582
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:30,490
found widely employed enough and never

583
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:32,380
will be for everyone to be using this

584
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:33,730
technology so we don't want to be

585
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:35,590
necessary it said they are able you can

586
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:38,170
reuse it on the end entities are

587
00:22:38,170 --> 00:22:39,760
dedicated to each other just like when

588
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,320
your friend comes by your house you know

589
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,940
that it's your friends not faking it

590
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:45,790
he's got some medicine allottees it's

591
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:48,280
the same person third parties can

592
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:50,200
identify who the attendees are or

593
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,420
talking this is a nice and we can we

594
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:55,210
communicate messages everyone and we

595
00:22:55,210 --> 00:22:56,920
have the Russell's against the captain

596
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,510
sort of go through a lot of different

597
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:00,400
things in order to attack the technology

598
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:03,610
if you find bugs in that technology one

599
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:05,410
be able to upgrade it to new version so

600
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:07,960
we get some diversity anyone hurt the

601
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:10,210
full packets and ideally it would be

602
00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:12,220
implementable by our typical developer

603
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:14,620
and usable by your typical user so it

604
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:16,600
sounds impossible is it just a dream

605
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,520
well maybe it but we're trying to figure

606
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:20,410
it out so how about a dress when i

607
00:23:20,410 --> 00:23:22,810
subtract requirements but word it's

608
00:23:22,810 --> 00:23:24,310
actually kind of bootstrap from clear

609
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:26,560
text encryption which is what the hell

610
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,810
in this right so we try to get banned it

611
00:23:28,810 --> 00:23:30,700
be all magazine this technology it's

612
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:31,980
actually a world approach

613
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:34,890
Sigma which was published years ago and

614
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:37,440
that's what kids used in night which is

615
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,480
internet key exchange of the IPF email

616
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:41,429
so what we've done is taken all those

617
00:23:41,429 --> 00:23:43,350
insights and we're trying to work a way

618
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:45,030
to do that over jabber because we have a

619
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:47,010
real-time communication system we don't

620
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:49,290
do object encryption like we do email

621
00:23:49,290 --> 00:23:51,210
she ever know if someone's in it when

622
00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:52,530
someone's going to pick out the email we

623
00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:54,690
can encrypt attention in real time and

624
00:23:54,690 --> 00:23:57,900
use that faculty have sessions to have a

625
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:00,210
smarter person technology so we haven't

626
00:24:00,210 --> 00:24:03,270
won success to talk about this 116 188

627
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:05,400
200 and its really become a major

628
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:08,940
priority for us in 2007 and NL that has

629
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:11,700
decided to get us some support to do

630
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,590
some work on this and we're very

631
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:15,690
appreciative of their support and we'll

632
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:17,700
be announcing that well pronouncing that

633
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:20,610
right now so we're pursuing a full

634
00:24:20,610 --> 00:24:22,700
security analysis to get these

635
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:25,950
technologies reviewed by real security

636
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:28,320
mafia people they put themselves in

637
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,320
security not yet i was kind of scary but

638
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:33,480
real security experts to do a security

639
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:36,090
analysis and code battle decent projects

640
00:24:36,090 --> 00:24:38,460
out there libraries and client

641
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:40,530
developers to try to get this code out

642
00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:42,330
there so that it can have some couple

643
00:24:42,330 --> 00:24:44,490
library if you can just drop into their

644
00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:46,490
clients and then we can have

645
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:49,760
and we're going to be posting more about

646
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:52,490
this at our blog we know professionalism

647
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:55,100
are being squad so we have blog applaud

648
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:56,990
that except eat our we're hoping we

649
00:24:56,990 --> 00:24:59,600
really to provide trade publications at

650
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,730
the end of the year so how we're doing

651
00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:03,260
on all these threats you know I went

652
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:05,480
through 20 threats out there over pretty

653
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:08,210
much spin free at least Im spam free and

654
00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:11,270
I have 1500 people in my buddy list in

655
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:14,179
life never seen any spin so i figured i

656
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:16,460
would give good spam hope you know we do

657
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:18,440
people are going to get it with you me

658
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,510
one of these days someone's gonna lots

659
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:22,460
of denial service tech just against me

660
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:25,790
na I targets boots the addresses we have

661
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:27,800
this pure XML so it really discourages

662
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:30,200
might malware but opposite tax their

663
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:33,650
possible but it's not easy and we're

664
00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:35,840
trying to make this argument ended we

665
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,820
have very widespread tamil encryption in

666
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:39,679
all the server communication we're

667
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:41,300
giving away certificates to try to get

668
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:43,460
people use this stuff and we're working

669
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:46,100
hard and encryption and it's been Dara's

670
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:48,050
been very widely deployed a lot of high

671
00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:49,460
security environments they don't like to

672
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:50,870
talk about it because they don't want to

673
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:53,059
talk about anything but basically all

674
00:25:53,059 --> 00:25:55,490
all be invested action and lovely loser

675
00:25:55,490 --> 00:25:57,660
cross or they have x509

676
00:25:57,660 --> 00:26:00,270
they've got smart cards that have teams

677
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:03,570
to get onto the system lot of numerous

678
00:26:03,570 --> 00:26:05,460
military applications that I don't know

679
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:07,170
about and even if I did I couldn't tell

680
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:10,890
you MIT and mighty sam assists you know

681
00:26:10,890 --> 00:26:12,660
that's the place very happy networks or

682
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:14,040
something that there is a Kerberos as

683
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,870
well I believe for their elf connotation

684
00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:18,630
on their job reserve which have a lot of

685
00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:20,550
public servers all the internet we

686
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:24,030
probably have you know i would say fifty

687
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:25,560
thousand or more servers on our network

688
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:27,450
and it's been out there since 99

689
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:30,390
obviously growing we've never had any

690
00:26:30,390 --> 00:26:32,070
major security breaches as far as i know

691
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:35,640
through jag reports now there's no

692
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:38,640
people installing trojans via the job

693
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,440
reports they might do it overage fee

694
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,600
with PHP acts and things like this but

695
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,970
doesn't even we can be complacent

696
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:47,040
there's always more to do but you know

697
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:49,170
that security is never any processed we

698
00:26:49,170 --> 00:26:51,240
are encouraging people to analyze our

699
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,310
technologies and try to hack into our

700
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:55,560
into a perch if they can write because

701
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:58,380
that's how we learn and if things great

702
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:00,450
and fix them and if they don't break we

703
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:02,190
kind of figure that hey baby this is a

704
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:03,690
good thing and but we need to keep

705
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:06,420
improving our technologies we have a

706
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:08,280
security and mailing list I should just

707
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:08,790
reset

708
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:10,980
this morning because we want to be able

709
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:13,080
to if I have ways to people just talk

710
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:14,760
about security stuff so we have security

711
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:17,940
guys meet at work and I say join the

712
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:19,830
conversation and let's try to build more

713
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:22,320
security so thank you and I hope you

714
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,950
have lots of questions

715
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:38,870
iconic security it's a controversial

716
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:42,830
issue now you have to question some of

717
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:44,720
my assertions has said things but they

718
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:49,960
may not be true how can you believe

719
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:58,740
okay would there be a way to have a

720
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:02,460
server-side blog yes there isn't that so

721
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:04,050
we have I didn't talk about it here

722
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:06,870
because I forgot so we have a technology

723
00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:10,800
for called message archiving so that's a

724
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:13,080
he's got a web client right the web

725
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:15,180
client is going to keep a lot of people

726
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:17,130
I take you there are analogs so you can

727
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:18,600
go back and search through them and find

728
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,400
out yeah last week I was talking to

729
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,680
Greece and he mentioned something and

730
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:24,450
let me go back to find it I don't

731
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:27,810
personally love my I am because I it's

732
00:28:27,810 --> 00:28:29,520
not perfect so I don't want to keep

733
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,260
their I didn't hurt my file systems but

734
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:34,050
you know how much do I really present so

735
00:28:34,050 --> 00:28:36,240
we do have a method for doing that we've

736
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,490
defined for archiving messages on the

737
00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:41,090
surface and then you use some tea

738
00:28:41,090 --> 00:28:44,460
materials that you come up with securely

739
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:46,620
save those logs on the server so that

740
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:49,590
even though you're you flogged the

741
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:54,510
computation only information it's not

742
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:56,730
it's not implemented really yes we have

743
00:28:56,730 --> 00:28:58,010
to help people working on

744
00:28:58,010 --> 00:29:00,710
it just things that the client's needs

745
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:02,450
do and some things that the service we

746
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:05,240
do make that happen but we have fun way

747
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:09,460
to do that it's a presser good

748
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:28,850
yes

749
00:29:30,090 --> 00:29:32,710
well but we humans road service well

750
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:34,450
again we haven't had any so we haven't

751
00:29:34,450 --> 00:29:35,919
really worked out some of the techniques

752
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:38,830
well mean if we had so let's if we had

753
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:41,610
grown servers

754
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:53,270
so you have we had no service let's have

755
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:55,870
a customer comment favorite bad biz

756
00:29:55,870 --> 00:29:59,360
decided to you know to attack our

757
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:03,850
network some of the servers have dynamic

758
00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:05,990
whitelisting black listings on the

759
00:30:05,990 --> 00:30:08,030
server own patients so you can

760
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:10,250
dynamically say I don't want to

761
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:12,950
communicate with certain domains I don't

762
00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:14,290
know that all the server's

763
00:30:14,290 --> 00:30:18,080
implementations have that obviously

764
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,550
block it before you get to the

765
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:21,920
application layer and you can block it

766
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:24,620
with like type of tables or something

767
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:26,990
like that right we if we have growth

768
00:30:26,990 --> 00:30:29,600
servers we have a lot of Road servers we

769
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,940
really care about this issue 8 11 drugs

770
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:34,070
are group people would learn about

771
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:36,939
pretty quickly in

772
00:30:43,330 --> 00:30:47,740
yes so yeah so the tip right you can run

773
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:50,140
your own as an observer which kind of

774
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:52,270
look like it did all the right stuff for

775
00:30:52,270 --> 00:30:54,220
the protocol right and it did nasty

776
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:56,980
things after that or just sent a lot of

777
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:59,470
package we also have a great limiting on

778
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:01,600
a lot of the server implementations can

779
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,100
create the meaning for server server

780
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:05,560
anointed target server communications as

781
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:07,540
well so if you start to be flooded by a

782
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:09,790
certain server they would get rate

783
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:12,910
limited and in it there they could send

784
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:15,010
dealer packets and so they have to stay

785
00:31:15,010 --> 00:31:17,290
within some boundaries typically how

786
00:31:17,290 --> 00:31:21,280
much traffic they go to generate we

787
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:23,170
haven't seen those yet I'm sure we will

788
00:31:23,170 --> 00:31:27,400
I mean once we have enough part of them

789
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,870
is part of the problem part of the

790
00:31:28,870 --> 00:31:31,480
problem with is the best team it which

791
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:33,550
is the main application for a gabber is

792
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:35,650
that we have this communication silence

793
00:31:35,650 --> 00:31:39,100
right this msn and got food a well and I

794
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:42,220
see to you so we don't have we don't

795
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:43,960
have an open network like you do the

796
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:46,000
vmail which is a bad thing because you

797
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,860
can't talk to everyone using for I am

798
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:50,700
clients but I'm the other way

799
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:52,230
it could even be seen as something of a

800
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:54,690
good thing because you don't have the

801
00:31:54,690 --> 00:31:56,820
kind of open communications that we have

802
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:58,530
female so it's not as much a tempting

803
00:31:58,530 --> 00:32:02,880
target to try to tap I personally would

804
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,280
prefer open communications over these

805
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:07,200
communication silence but once we have

806
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,540
get rid of the silos and this is the

807
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:12,180
excuse that AOL 0 is 0 we want to open

808
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:14,940
up who really do but we need to protect

809
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:18,330
our users well when you do a maybe don't

810
00:32:18,330 --> 00:32:19,800
if you would use the real technology

811
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,630
like XP he wouldn't have to worry about

812
00:32:21,630 --> 00:32:26,850
it but so I think that's one of the

813
00:32:26,850 --> 00:32:28,320
reasons that we don't have a lot of spam

814
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,900
I am now they must be able things like

815
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:33,720
icq because there's consecutive numbers

816
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:36,630
right so you can just understand this

817
00:32:36,630 --> 00:32:38,340
number and I'm going to anything I wanna

818
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:40,710
spend the next number and that's how it

819
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:43,110
makes very easy and you I don't know how

820
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:45,630
AOL does it for a while its mysterious

821
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:48,870
and does it but obviously part actually

822
00:32:48,870 --> 00:32:50,390
come to you

823
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:53,690
addresses and then starts Ben it's a

824
00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:55,490
little harder to do that never he only

825
00:32:55,490 --> 00:32:57,350
drank three hearts I've heard of the

826
00:32:57,350 --> 00:33:00,080
gabris was on a server where the email

827
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,900
address was the same as a jabber ID so

828
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:06,320
they attacked the we have these user

829
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,030
directories they attack you jabber user

830
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:10,070
directory just to get the email

831
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:11,840
addresses and then they would instead

832
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,610
spam by email because commercial

833
00:33:13,610 --> 00:33:15,770
antisense man by terror but at least

834
00:33:15,770 --> 00:33:17,270
they could get those addresses because

835
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:19,070
they do do the same this was actually

836
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:22,250
there's a lot of Jabbar service in Cuba

837
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:24,710
or summaries and this is one of the

838
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:36,740
servers to Cuba yes oh I'm sorry I was

839
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:37,940
pointing to this person way in the back

840
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:40,580
but I'll take your question first how

841
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:41,840
does people didn't tell the difference

842
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,310
between a jabber address and email

843
00:33:43,310 --> 00:33:49,430
address well we should be using you our

844
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:53,450
eyes right and if I could if I couldn't

845
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:55,790
domain name on like the AMA on the side

846
00:33:55,790 --> 00:33:58,730
of the bus right and says Boston dollar

847
00:33:58,730 --> 00:34:02,980
but that was that do i do HTTP do i do

848
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:06,020
ftp do i do well you know i need a phone

849
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:08,210
call in from something so yeah there's

850
00:34:08,210 --> 00:34:10,310
confusion about sometimes between jabber

851
00:34:10,310 --> 00:34:12,590
addresses and email addresses because

852
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:13,449
you should

853
00:34:13,449 --> 00:34:16,089
your business card you know Jabbar ID is

854
00:34:16,089 --> 00:34:18,250
this an email ID is that you know I

855
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:20,409
happen to be the one of the admins

856
00:34:20,409 --> 00:34:24,399
Jericho or server and so and I'm also

857
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:27,010
one of the nail postmaster and all that

858
00:34:27,010 --> 00:34:29,409
kind of stuff so what I will see is that

859
00:34:29,409 --> 00:34:32,790
people are trying to send spam to

860
00:34:32,790 --> 00:34:35,230
addresses a job at work better athlete

861
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:37,239
average is only like five feet level

862
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:39,879
email addresses at devereux everyone

863
00:34:39,879 --> 00:34:41,949
else has jack varieties so I see all

864
00:34:41,949 --> 00:34:44,469
these people who advertise that jabber

865
00:34:44,469 --> 00:34:46,629
idea Jeff that work on our website so

866
00:34:46,629 --> 00:34:48,429
like that the standards are now going to

867
00:34:48,429 --> 00:34:50,829
do in kind of harvesting and send spam

868
00:34:50,829 --> 00:34:52,989
now to or from these addresses that

869
00:34:52,989 --> 00:34:54,940
don't exist so it's really kind of sad

870
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:57,160
miss Danvers in fact i think that the

871
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:58,630
damn right things are different from the

872
00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:02,560
email ids but there's no they only had a

873
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:05,710
vocaloid pelvis but the uri scheme

874
00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:07,780
project then you know what what the

875
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:11,950
entity really is we have urs visa RFC 36

876
00:35:11,950 --> 00:35:14,500
22 so we have an accent computer or

877
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:17,410
riesling so he put a semicolon safety or

878
00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:19,119
Jeff Ratner we're good to tell that is

879
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:20,570
different from male

880
00:35:20,570 --> 00:35:25,790
that's why do I students do for us yes

881
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:29,940
if you just speak up and eat your

882
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:32,330
question

883
00:35:45,579 --> 00:35:48,349
so the question we set up this

884
00:35:48,349 --> 00:35:51,589
certification Authority and someone who

885
00:35:51,589 --> 00:35:54,589
now comes and says oh I'm paypal you

886
00:35:54,589 --> 00:35:57,230
know please give me assert well sure

887
00:35:57,230 --> 00:35:58,910
they because we do a lot of stuff to

888
00:35:58,910 --> 00:36:00,770
figure out whether you really are you

889
00:36:00,770 --> 00:36:02,990
say or and so we have actually talked

890
00:36:02,990 --> 00:36:05,480
expect process one is that you request

891
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:07,880
an account execute feedback which

892
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:09,800
doesn't give it to me search for

893
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:12,380
certification authority at all all that

894
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:14,869
we knew is v2 some whois lookup somebody

895
00:36:14,869 --> 00:36:17,660
verify that this person is associated

896
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:19,280
with the domains the good question and

897
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:22,430
so what happens is that a lot of people

898
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:24,920
say oh yeah I want to register an

899
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:27,050
account at viikii.net because I want to

900
00:36:27,050 --> 00:36:28,640
get a certificate for the surface server

901
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:31,160
and then we will who is look up and we

902
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:32,540
see that they're not associated with

903
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:34,490
this domain at all and though so that we

904
00:36:34,490 --> 00:36:37,160
say are you really associated with this

905
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:39,230
domain we do I to proofing contact the

906
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:40,940
domain owners registrants for this

907
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:45,310
domain and then they say oh yeah

908
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:48,160
or they say yeah I really have the

909
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:50,050
jabber server admin but I don't have

910
00:36:50,050 --> 00:36:53,070
access to all the postmaster addresses

911
00:36:53,070 --> 00:36:56,020
so then we contact a real loner then

912
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:57,730
take this person who asserts that

913
00:36:57,730 --> 00:36:59,619
they're associated with your domain

914
00:36:59,619 --> 00:37:02,290
really hard about domain and if they say

915
00:37:02,290 --> 00:37:05,440
yes then we let them have an account

916
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,480
activity on net but that just is the

917
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:09,300
first step so in order to get to our

918
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:12,070
certification Authority you have to get

919
00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:17,109
to a certain URL into an HTTP POST to go

920
00:37:17,109 --> 00:37:19,390
from there and then get to the Internet

921
00:37:19,390 --> 00:37:22,060
to the certification Authority website

922
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:24,369
and then there's all sorts of other

923
00:37:24,369 --> 00:37:25,960
groups you have to jump through once you

924
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:27,250
get to the certification Authority

925
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:29,410
website to prove that really are

926
00:37:29,410 --> 00:37:31,150
associated with domain and they do all

927
00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:33,310
sorts of checks the IP addresses in the

928
00:37:33,310 --> 00:37:35,500
mail servers that extend to one

929
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:38,980
economical a dress customary 5c 4122 and

930
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:41,740
so on and so forth is key come back

931
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:43,480
within a certain amount of time then you

932
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,400
can go to a birth certificate and then

933
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,930
if they find out that you really are you

934
00:37:46,930 --> 00:37:48,100
say you are we'll just revoke your

935
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:51,010
certificate throw you out so we do a lot

936
00:37:51,010 --> 00:37:52,660
of things to try to prevent people from

937
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:55,240
trying to gain the system but i'm not

938
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:56,230
going to plant

939
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:58,090
because if you plan perfection with

940
00:37:58,090 --> 00:37:59,950
regard to security technology someone

941
00:37:59,950 --> 00:38:02,050
figure out a way around it but we're

942
00:38:02,050 --> 00:38:07,000
trying to do the right things that's the

943
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:11,490
long story yes

944
00:38:14,770 --> 00:38:21,240
oh yeah

945
00:38:27,130 --> 00:38:29,109
so you're talking about hanging around

946
00:38:29,109 --> 00:38:31,549
okay so there's a technology called Tory

947
00:38:31,549 --> 00:38:33,470
people have heard a tour or monday

948
00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:38,329
drowning pool i use tor tor school the

949
00:38:38,329 --> 00:38:42,109
top of the tutorial in clinton jabber

950
00:38:42,109 --> 00:38:45,589
over toward i haven't set it up as I had

951
00:38:45,589 --> 00:38:48,500
trouble setting up the service that for

952
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:50,809
services I didn't spend enough time to

953
00:38:50,809 --> 00:38:53,269
figure out at a setup for services but

954
00:38:53,269 --> 00:38:55,700
you can set up jabbar as a service on

955
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:59,089
your tour and then you use the tour

956
00:38:59,089 --> 00:39:02,329
onion ground to you know hi it with its

957
00:39:02,329 --> 00:39:04,490
what the path is the network and those

958
00:39:04,490 --> 00:39:07,160
kind of things problem Martha problems

959
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:09,289
is that if you've used for we know that

960
00:39:09,289 --> 00:39:12,049
there's latency involved and people

961
00:39:12,049 --> 00:39:13,519
don't like latency when it comes to

962
00:39:13,519 --> 00:39:15,380
investigate they're just not very

963
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:17,930
tolerant solo even though we can't do it

964
00:39:17,930 --> 00:39:19,940
I think very few people will because

965
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:21,559
they're tightening very fast and they

966
00:39:21,559 --> 00:39:23,029
want to get the communications right

967
00:39:23,029 --> 00:39:27,230
away so it can be done but I don't think

968
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:30,640
that a lot of people love you

969
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:40,339
really that's a thing as going to have a

970
00:39:40,339 --> 00:39:42,500
high will have a low latency application

971
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:45,140
right like VoIP or something like that

972
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:48,380
and really people they get very

973
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:51,230
frustrated if they need if things aren't

974
00:39:51,230 --> 00:39:53,030
going through right away but yes it can

975
00:39:53,030 --> 00:39:55,550
be done I have a message myself I should

976
00:39:55,550 --> 00:39:58,910
do that not like the concept of poor

977
00:39:58,910 --> 00:40:01,940
especially if you are in you know the

978
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:04,460
country you're trying to be a journalist

979
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:06,740
or doctors and order for these massive

980
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:10,190
people who are trying to work in llamar

981
00:40:10,190 --> 00:40:12,930
or someplace like that

982
00:40:12,930 --> 00:40:15,859
to know that

983
00:40:25,170 --> 00:40:27,569
so how do you ensure the TLS that we use

984
00:40:27,569 --> 00:40:29,369
if it's available so we do have the

985
00:40:29,369 --> 00:40:32,430
articles to as a server policy you can

986
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:35,849
see the GLS is required so a server can

987
00:40:35,849 --> 00:40:38,730
not only offer tail as required pls

988
00:40:38,730 --> 00:40:40,799
we're not probably going to do that very

989
00:40:40,799 --> 00:40:42,210
soon because we're still waiting for

990
00:40:42,210 --> 00:40:44,700
more people to get certificates but i

991
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:47,040
think that i can see today in maybe 12

992
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,809
months or 18 months where a lot of

993
00:40:48,809 --> 00:40:50,700
servers will just say no i'm not going

994
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:52,920
to accept any 15 connections so I

995
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:55,859
require TLS you must have certificate

996
00:40:55,859 --> 00:40:58,950
and that day will come but we're working

997
00:40:58,950 --> 00:41:00,690
towards that but we've all the servers

998
00:41:00,690 --> 00:41:02,460
and then the underlying protocol have a

999
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:05,819
way to to require the use of transport

1000
00:41:05,819 --> 00:41:12,210
layer security we don't really we don't

1001
00:41:12,210 --> 00:41:14,010
have a way right now to do kind of a

1002
00:41:14,010 --> 00:41:17,520
traceroute right so if I'm a client over

1003
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,980
here you're across them over there I

1004
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:23,400
don't have my way right now to check the

1005
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:26,700
whole path and know that there's pls but

1006
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:27,990
of course you have to trust all the

1007
00:41:27,990 --> 00:41:30,750
entities in the middle to tell to really

1008
00:41:30,750 --> 00:41:32,880
so you know you're back to square one at

1009
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,559
that point because you have to trust

1010
00:41:34,559 --> 00:41:36,750
that your boss sent by org is really

1011
00:41:36,750 --> 00:41:38,700
giving me program results

1012
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:40,440
whether it's using TLS for the

1013
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:41,910
connection between you and the server

1014
00:41:41,910 --> 00:41:44,190
and the search connection so you know

1015
00:41:44,190 --> 00:41:46,050
the sound of hogs there if you're using

1016
00:41:46,050 --> 00:41:49,740
some HTTP connector that's kind of proxy

1017
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:51,750
in there you know you need to really

1018
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:53,730
check that to the path there's a lot

1019
00:41:53,730 --> 00:41:55,829
involved by that point resolution send

1020
00:41:55,829 --> 00:42:04,010
an encryption I think desk

1021
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:09,970
now there's no support required for the

1022
00:42:09,970 --> 00:42:11,740
server I mean if you're going we don't

1023
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:13,690
trust servers people who want to

1024
00:42:13,690 --> 00:42:15,400
endanger Griffin don't trust the servers

1025
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:17,650
and they're justified or not trusting

1026
00:42:17,650 --> 00:42:19,480
deserves because i think the dustin

1027
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:21,760
might be there middle and they might be

1028
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:24,310
and then so there's no certain services

1029
00:42:24,310 --> 00:42:27,070
court required at all there is if you

1030
00:42:27,070 --> 00:42:29,440
want to do certain forms of any

1031
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:31,750
encryption we probably want to have a

1032
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:34,180
way of storing your keys on the server

1033
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:35,620
you're probably keith night crowd piece

1034
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:38,650
but the story of LPS on the server so

1035
00:42:38,650 --> 00:42:41,950
you might have to have some level of

1036
00:42:41,950 --> 00:42:44,440
trust i suppose in your own server in

1037
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:46,840
the sense that it's not you know but if

1038
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:48,460
it's going to be compromised your keys

1039
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:51,120
there you know further there or you know

1040
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:53,350
that would be helpful is for certain

1041
00:42:53,350 --> 00:42:55,660
kinds of scenarios for offline messages

1042
00:42:55,660 --> 00:42:58,180
you can send it Jerry of example message

1043
00:42:58,180 --> 00:43:01,210
gets stored on the server and then it

1044
00:43:01,210 --> 00:43:02,410
gets delivered when the other person

1045
00:43:02,410 --> 00:43:04,480
comes online driver state you're not

1046
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:05,860
going to do that with this in any

1047
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:08,860
perfume technology because at least non

1048
00:43:08,860 --> 00:43:10,870
grata clocks because that person that

1049
00:43:10,870 --> 00:43:12,310
will be able to read message so we have

1050
00:43:12,310 --> 00:43:15,040
some fancy stuff that we do have an

1051
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:20,460
offline mode this as well yes

1052
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:32,410
so the lies you foresee problems of

1053
00:43:32,410 --> 00:43:34,790
people governments let's say

1054
00:43:34,790 --> 00:43:37,190
organizations saying no we're not going

1055
00:43:37,190 --> 00:43:38,990
to allow any traffic that is trying to

1056
00:43:38,990 --> 00:43:42,080
use this invention technology well you

1057
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:44,090
know i'm not i would score c

1058
00:43:44,090 --> 00:43:46,040
corporations a lot of corporations they

1059
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:48,050
have legal requirements at least in the

1060
00:43:48,050 --> 00:43:50,780
States for sarbanes-oxley and these

1061
00:43:50,780 --> 00:43:52,790
kinds of reporting requirements and SSE

1062
00:43:52,790 --> 00:43:55,000
so they need to actually store the

1063
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,720
messages that people in their

1064
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:59,240
corporation send for legal purposes and

1065
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:00,560
they won't be able to use this

1066
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:02,870
technology obviously but that's going to

1067
00:44:02,870 --> 00:44:04,640
be a corporate policy I don't know about

1068
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:07,460
that the government level I don't know

1069
00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:09,230
how they going to enforce that I'm not

1070
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:11,330
sure they can try to do traffic analysis

1071
00:44:11,330 --> 00:44:14,180
and send things in certain namespaces in

1072
00:44:14,180 --> 00:44:19,180
XML they throw it out things but is that

1073
00:44:19,180 --> 00:44:22,340
possibly going to happen good name you

1074
00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:25,430
just we know who's involved and who

1075
00:44:25,430 --> 00:44:26,589
cares about this thing

1076
00:44:26,589 --> 00:44:29,499
we may care more about and aversion to

1077
00:44:29,499 --> 00:44:31,180
make air or even pay attention to

1078
00:44:31,180 --> 00:44:33,339
Deborah but you know that they may come

1079
00:44:33,339 --> 00:44:37,499
I certain surfacing at the corporations

1080
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:42,420
okay

1081
00:44:47,830 --> 00:44:49,890
you
