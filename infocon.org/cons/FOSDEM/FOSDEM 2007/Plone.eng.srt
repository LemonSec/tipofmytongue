you actually do anything with lab and

42
00:02:44,129 --> 00:02:48,989
development there was one hand

43
00:02:48,989 --> 00:02:52,000

00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:15,579
we're getting like the chase for all the

50
00:03:15,579 --> 00:03:17,230
many people who are in the business of

51
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:19,360
selling such a thing to you just took

52
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,829
pictures and broke down all of your

53
00:03:20,829 --> 00:03:25,360
names it gets off later about that ok so

54
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,780
number forty years i live in France just

55
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:31,480
move back and in all those years I never

56
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:34,329
got a chance to come to Fontaine I move

57
00:03:34,329 --> 00:03:38,069
back to the US in August and Here I am

58
00:03:38,069 --> 00:03:41,049
what's the sense of that I'd like to

59
00:03:41,049 --> 00:03:42,910
know that this is a picture of my wife

60
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:51,780
back to the world with this presentation

61
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:55,959
just chill out I know I am because I did

62
00:03:55,959 --> 00:03:58,470
no work for this presentation I am

63
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:01,269
screencast for everything it's all

64
00:04:01,269 --> 00:04:04,450
available off of that URL or Leaburg did

65
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:09,910
it will be later on the hotel he's

66
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:11,620
really fun to wake up the morning your

67
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:14,230
presentations with the last finishing

68
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:16,120
touches you know the ninety-nine percent

69
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,320
that you're right to give the

70
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,959
presentation and the old launch web

71
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:22,450
service inside your hotel takes your

72
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:25,330
credit card transaction is completed

73
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:26,919
that part of the park road actually

74
00:04:26,919 --> 00:04:30,700
designed you an IP address failed that

75
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,740
so the slides are the material are

76
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:34,479
actually dumped a couple things will be

77
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:38,919
in summary blow 2.5 is the release

78
00:04:38,919 --> 00:04:39,780
version right now

79
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:42,570
three is being worked on has a lot of

80
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:45,660
really good and useful user features for

81
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,910
content management systems like merging

82
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:50,580
also ask exciting development stuff too

83
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:52,260
mostly what I have to talk about today

84
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:54,930
is it about the part at the end I'm

85
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:57,480
going to do something really stupid and

86
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:01,800
use the trunk to give a demo source of

87
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,230
these are features the things we're

88
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:06,419
going to talk about are a little bit

89
00:05:06,419 --> 00:05:08,760
about the new ways in the world and

90
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,590
flows and to a degree the world's is

91
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:12,570
open Python for how do you get a

92
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:14,610
developer sandbox install how you do

93
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:15,830
your work and share with other people

94
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:18,000
we're going to talk about much boss

95
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,800
project from doing Ajax and why i say

96
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,250
useful also a little bit about portlets

97
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:28,320
to show some of the stuff and our staff

98
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,600
is coming up and then violated for thrus

99
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:34,380
members so what's going on with blowing

100
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:38,310
free maybe even release this is a

101
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:43,430
screenshot of the page for the movies

102
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:48,000
the manages the road map these are the

103
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,510
crack smoking itself at predicting the

104
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:56,580
future and these are the clips they go

105
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:58,500
let's call it below an improvement

106
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,360
proposal where you right now what you

107
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,070
plan to get somebody's gonna bring with

108
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:04,470
it the scheduled for release a pretty

109
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:07,310
interesting approach to managing board

110
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:09,600
lots of new stuff coming into one free

111
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,940
let's go ahead and get started jump

112
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:14,430
right into it will show a Dillo about

113
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:18,020
getting a sandbox installed and then I

114
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:20,400
what if i give a present

115
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,650
pretend that I was listening

116
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:24,780
presentation what would I like to hear

117
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:26,460
is a presentation I know what you really

118
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:29,490
like is a bunch of slides painting

119
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:32,039
bullets in a four point font and a

120
00:06:32,039 --> 00:06:35,280
presenter reading them to you as if you

121
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,949
would standing in the university lecture

122
00:06:37,949 --> 00:06:40,169
hall with white boards but you don't

123
00:06:40,169 --> 00:06:42,120
want that I don't want that so I'm going

124
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,370
to show things we personally explain too

125
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:47,070
late so the first of all these are the

126
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:49,729
people involved in the work on getting

127
00:06:49,729 --> 00:06:52,590
this part of the presentation or

128
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:56,760
deferred a sandbox built that's not

129
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,949
helpful that's what there's this big

130
00:06:58,949 --> 00:07:00,750
thing on top of the United States was

131
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:06,990
nothing home Canada can I like to think

132
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:08,699
fun about the tax as Americans don't

133
00:07:08,699 --> 00:07:11,490
really know the head funny enough we

134
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:14,270
just past the tipping point of absurdity

135
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:16,830
fifty percent of kids in the United

136
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:19,740
States can't be behind the United States

137
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:28,500
of enclosure ok so here in the great

138
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:32,580
world of 2007 which is ten years after

139
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:34,800
the zoeb application server starting

140
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,380
coming out and things are starting to

141
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:39,599
change in our stack in the Python level

142
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:42,900
Python is starting to get a system for

143
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:45,419
packaging things up and distributing

144
00:07:45,419 --> 00:07:47,430
them to other people in the clearing

145
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:48,990
dependence things these are called eggs

146
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:53,699
and as a system for getting these eggs

147
00:07:53,699 --> 00:07:58,560
and installing them that is someone

148
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,970
deceptively call them easy install and

149
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:06,210
then interesting things also going on in

150
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:07,460
vinyl world

151
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:10,430
how applications can work together nice

152
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:12,410
thing about my phone is it's so easy to

153
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:14,810
write a web application which is also

154
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:16,729
the worst thing about my fine because

155
00:08:16,729 --> 00:08:18,199
they everybody does write web

156
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:20,630
application so in an attempt to try and

157
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:23,000
share something stuff there is a web

158
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:32,570
services gateway interface wisdom sound

159
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:42,440
like in spite on top of these advances

160
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,750
of time on their attempts to try and

161
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:48,920
manage the entire process including your

162
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,480
own business configuration information

163
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,480
etc wrapping them up into recipes you

164
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,670
send other people this is built out and

165
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:58,850
working and then finally to attempt to

166
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:04,490
shape is anybody use uh rails so rails

167
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:07,070
brought out this idea that you can press

168
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:09,200
a couple buttons in your entire project

169
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,290
you ready for you and then you can just

170
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:14,060
have a work on invoicing client

171
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:18,350
scaffolding it's a hike on systems are

172
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:19,339
trying to work on that island

173
00:09:19,339 --> 00:09:21,140
scaffolding by merrily with something

174
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:22,870
called a system a system called pace

175
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:25,480
which is really nice because you can

176
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:28,269
instead of telling people than 15

177
00:09:28,269 --> 00:09:31,610
you can create one of these install it

178
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:33,410
as an egg and then someone can run a

179
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:36,440
simple command and house built for the

180
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:39,680
regular including the passwords and

181
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:43,160
stuff like that and if it's of these

182
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:47,389
free ah geez I'm dumb every time i tried

183
00:09:47,389 --> 00:09:49,130
to do something I line up bugging them

184
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:51,410
fed bunny one of the core developers so

185
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:53,120
I Stephanie bugging them they just give

186
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,250
me one of these gaveling things I run it

187
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:59,240
I get a shiny pony I can play with my

188
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,519
money and I wonder anymore since

189
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:03,670
happening is written for people like me

190
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:06,110
the other benefit probably get to letter

191
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:07,399
so it will work being women we're

192
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:09,079
pythonic lovers some of the advances of

193
00:10:09,079 --> 00:10:11,810
time and then really cool thing is is

194
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:13,880
grateful hard driving factors because

195
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,620
every time when you do well one of these

196
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:18,319
things you get the universe is fall in

197
00:10:18,319 --> 00:10:22,970
the new directory under silver 295 for

198
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:28,610
you think of all that okay so let me go

199
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:31,490
over and do like the look for this one I

200
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:34,339
try to embed this into my presentation

201
00:10:34,339 --> 00:10:41,410
but you know loves quicktime flash

202
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,720
Oh

203
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:57,590
okay so this is my screencast to show

204
00:11:57,590 --> 00:12:00,360
the system i'm using for getting all

205
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,880
these bits installed well documented you

206
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,770
can find a single command and you'll get

207
00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:08,670
all your stuff this is what i'm going to

208
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:13,530
run me actually doing it easy as falls a

209
00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:16,020
little bit like see hannah rubygems or

210
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:18,150
something like that a registry on the

211
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:20,640
web with people put packages you can run

212
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,290
a single command I'm go get all the

213
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:24,630
Tennyson's for you install them in this

214
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:28,130
case i've already installed it

215
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:35,340
processing dependencies for this system

216
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:37,680
and i'm doing flown in you said a couple

217
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,720
of environment variables the point that

218
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,670
some of the bits you need and then after

219
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:45,090
that everything that's done for you this

220
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:48,000
has recipes from getting 13 from the

221
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,780
trunk which is a wonderful experience

222
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:54,210
morgana release this is the part that I

223
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:56,670
like the most being as dumb as I am is

224
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:59,970
on balls that real quick is that I can

225
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:08,040
run a command it will start asking me

226
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,020
the questions to complete your design

227
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:11,820
trust like you'd expect for one of these

228
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:17,040
alpha memorial objects then he goes gets

229
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:20,990
whatever tools it needs installs them

230
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:24,150
next thing I'm going to do now that I

231
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:26,430
have an entire self-contained following

232
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:28,050
Department that's kind of a neat part of

233
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:30,330
it is that with other packaging systems

234
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:32,730
you might be finding my heart man or

235
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:33,540
something like that you might be

236
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:36,030
fighting with the systems packages and

237
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:39,870
every time that I use rpm invariably my

238
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:40,889
lips II would

239
00:13:40,889 --> 00:13:42,540
created you know it would trace the

240
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:44,189
cookie at all the way back to literacy

241
00:13:44,189 --> 00:13:45,899
and I thought if I say no to this

242
00:13:45,899 --> 00:13:47,999
question I'm going to have an unmovable

243
00:13:47,999 --> 00:13:50,579
system with this it's a package system

244
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:55,259
that can be completely self-contained so

245
00:13:55,259 --> 00:14:02,399
the next thing is to run the scapulae

246
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:04,350
thing rinse all the things would allow

247
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:08,249
me to run staffing oriented projects and

248
00:14:08,249 --> 00:14:09,989
now we can actually run this happening

249
00:14:09,989 --> 00:14:19,709
man this paste or create i'm going to

250
00:14:19,709 --> 00:14:22,889
choose a template they people out there

251
00:14:22,889 --> 00:14:24,839
that are making life easy Paul create

252
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:27,119
different templates 143 one that

253
00:14:27,119 --> 00:14:28,829
involves archetypes wonderful that's

254
00:14:28,829 --> 00:14:30,720
that the other thing one for shopping

255
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,709
park whatever you can get install these

256
00:14:33,709 --> 00:14:36,239
templates and then just answer questions

257
00:14:36,239 --> 00:14:39,089
what each one will do is ask you a set

258
00:14:39,089 --> 00:14:40,859
of questions about what you want in

259
00:14:40,859 --> 00:14:42,689
order to have something ready to go out

260
00:14:42,689 --> 00:14:50,939
of lots here goes asking the series of

261
00:14:50,939 --> 00:14:53,279
questions for example all the meta

262
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:55,649
information that might go it's the

263
00:14:55,649 --> 00:15:03,619
package effects and then I'll just

264
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:19,310
my system and then I can do the chance

265
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:20,990
to make this active and then run the

266
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:26,740
server so now catch up in this section

267
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:29,540
so with all of this work what's

268
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:31,250
happiness more more people start to

269
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:33,649
adopt these advances of Python in these

270
00:15:33,649 --> 00:15:36,230
advances in these web systems will be

271
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:39,920
able to go and get packages installed

272
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,380
and really easily create a cure to share

273
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:44,000
them with other people track your

274
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,920
dependencies create built-in

275
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,959
configurations any of you like to

276
00:15:47,959 --> 00:15:50,329
customer work this is just awesome

277
00:15:50,329 --> 00:15:52,519
because the names were you have to login

278
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:55,220
in their system and do 20 or 30 things

279
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:58,160
or to get them started you can just send

280
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,860
them a recipe hopefully you can still

281
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:09,230
remember you okay so that's the first

282
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:11,810
part of the presentation on packaging on

283
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:15,199
to some more exciting stuff in the bone

284
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:22,579
three please Ajax is appearing in lots

285
00:16:22,579 --> 00:16:24,920
of assistance these days in the

286
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:27,769
beginning I described it as useful and

287
00:16:27,769 --> 00:16:30,290
simple because the work that goes why

288
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:33,170
and others are doing in plum is to go

289
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:36,560
after some specific usability issues for

290
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,320
the new scripts the server to have boxes

291
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,329
that reflect changes with each other and

292
00:16:41,329 --> 00:16:46,250
to also make it simple so that the kinds

293
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:48,470
of people who create valuable things in

294
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:51,620
loans a day can create valuable things

295
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:51,939
that

296
00:16:51,939 --> 00:16:57,519
Ajax the KSS approach is to be

297
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:00,220
declarative which I really like they use

298
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:02,739
something that looks exactly like a CSS

299
00:17:02,739 --> 00:17:05,319
style sheet and sent to the browser the

300
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:07,990
browser then interprets that and sets up

301
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:12,398
your various Ajax behaviors nisha have a

302
00:17:12,398 --> 00:17:14,529
very limited stuff well described

303
00:17:14,529 --> 00:17:17,919
universe of things that you can do those

304
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:20,019
are flying actions then they talk two

305
00:17:20,019 --> 00:17:21,250
things on the server called server

306
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:23,439
actions the server has a really

307
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:25,269
interesting approach were able bundle up

308
00:17:25,269 --> 00:17:26,829
the unit of work send it back for

309
00:17:26,829 --> 00:17:28,509
execution on the line that's what we'll

310
00:17:28,509 --> 00:17:39,279
see in the demo okay so onto the demo

311
00:17:39,279 --> 00:17:41,759
for this

312
00:17:58,430 --> 00:18:08,550
we're just break this into into two

313
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:10,950
parts of the demo one for the client

314
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:16,020
action stuff so in this case what we

315
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:20,850
want to do is we want to extend the

316
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:23,010
behavior of plums so that when you click

317
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:25,140
on the description field that appears on

318
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:28,050
every page something mountains and we'll

319
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:29,520
walk through the process of first

320
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,010
showing anything the client set up with

321
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:34,260
the CSS declarative language and then

322
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:42,900
have something happen on sir the first

323
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:45,090
thing that they show you when the KSS

324
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:46,950
game is to get your client environment

325
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:49,110
setup everybody use inspire both these

326
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:52,680
days is the way to send out the bug

327
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:56,670
messages so we're useful so these are

328
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:58,350
some of the debug messages that you get

329
00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:03,750
qualified for KSS a little bit chatty so

330
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:06,000
those things that the second thing they

331
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,170
tell you to do is go to turn all that

332
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:14,880
stuff off for those of you that never

333
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,680
seen so before so has this thing called

334
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,750
the soap management interface which is a

335
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:20,880
UI has been there for a long time for

336
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,760
configuring the application server this

337
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,680
case we're going to go into the park

338
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,960
aplomb that lets you configure all the

339
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:30,630
style sheets that go in your site begin

340
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:32,580
to include enough for various conditions

341
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:35,280
and we just disabled temporarily

342
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,320
disabled two of the stylesheets the ones

343
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:44,340
is few all those messages once we get

344
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:46,170
that far once we have fire bug under

345
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:49,590
control and get the debug messages under

346
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:50,250
control

347
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:52,020
we're going to do is actually create a

348
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:54,990
little hello world style sheet usually

349
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:57,030
you do this on the file system so that

350
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:58,830
you can just check it into subversion

351
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:00,900
and send its people you're getting a dip

352
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,850
up you want to do it the fastest way

353
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:04,650
possible once you get something working

354
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:08,070
ordinate later so with soap you're able

355
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:10,070
to go and create things through the web

356
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:13,350
create templates and miles and

357
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:15,270
stylesheets this case I'm going to

358
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:17,100
create a style sheet through the web

359
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:21,240
that has some of this KSS declarative

360
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:24,960
language in it so this is the part in my

361
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:28,710
opinion at least of Kate assess it can

362
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:31,230
say it looks like CSS and feels a lot

363
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,840
like CSS we're doing a CSS identifier to

364
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,630
say this download york times building

365
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:40,830
description is going to have what feels

366
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:43,830
like a CSS selector but in this case

367
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:46,050
instead of hover or something like that

368
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:48,600
it's the click event and then it's going

369
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:49,950
to have this configuration information

370
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:54,510
associated with this stuff in the middle

371
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:57,900
here is obviously unique to KSS it would

372
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:00,330
be considered an invalid normal CSS

373
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:02,850
stylesheet once we have the stylesheet

374
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:05,010
included we go back over the thing you

375
00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:08,010
just saw the CSS registry and tell plum

376
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:10,110
okay I've got a new style sheet for you

377
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:12,830
you need to include it in all the pages

378
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:15,300
but in this case the stylesheets a

379
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:17,550
little bit special it's not a normal CSS

380
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:21,900
stylesheet it is this type here we're

381
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:25,400
linking to the file name over in the

382
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:29,190
systems we just created we've put the

383
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:30,840
kind of relationship with one and since

384
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,610
we're in debug mode

385
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:34,140
one student around some of this other

386
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:37,170
reports or anything stuff what's that's

387
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:40,740
done and we have this directed to so CSS

388
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:44,280
registry by the way I'm talking in the

389
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:46,290
background on all the screencast stuff

390
00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:48,630
so you can listen to me explain all this

391
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:51,809
stuff and we reload the page then I can

392
00:21:51,809 --> 00:21:55,140
go and click on the description and see

393
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:57,990
my first the first thing I do for

394
00:21:57,990 --> 00:21:59,850
debugging is going to make sure that the

395
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:02,730
sky figured works I go look for the

396
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:04,590
style sheet and yes there's the style

397
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:06,990
sheet it is LinkedIn like we just pulled

398
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:10,140
this yes we do I'm gonna check Firebug

399
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:12,600
see a wife is totally worked it up no I

400
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:15,150
didn't it was able to find that style

401
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:18,150
sheet it was able to parson and it

402
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:21,480
actually interpreted those rules if I

403
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,460
put a bogus rule in there but it told me

404
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:25,440
I don't know what you're doing close

405
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,650
Firebug and now under this work over

406
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:30,840
this work this is what's great about

407
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:34,169
scraped past presentation when I did

408
00:22:34,169 --> 00:22:36,150
that when I actually reported that the

409
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:37,950
first five times i click that it didn't

410
00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:41,040
work just win to the screencaps deleted

411
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:45,540
that part Arab next debugging through

412
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:49,590
scream mask all night presentations them

413
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:53,520
perfectly is pretty silly you know we're

414
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,080
just picking up a static message let's

415
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,190
do something a little bit more

416
00:22:56,190 --> 00:22:58,290
interesting let's put a custom alert

417
00:22:58,290 --> 00:23:00,870
message so the idea here is that on each

418
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:03,000
one of these directives and Cass says

419
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,860
that match up to something in the

420
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:08,660
client-side dom by putting some

421
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:10,620
instructions for what's supposed to

422
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:12,919
happen I just added another construction

423
00:23:12,919 --> 00:23:15,780
and there's lots of things we did the

424
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:20,040
last time of these easy signing from the

425
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,660
developer's perspective this is all that

426
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:25,110
still leaves CSS JavaScript crap what

427
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:26,850
happens on the server because we want

428
00:23:26,850 --> 00:23:29,789
these boxes to interact with the server

429
00:23:29,789 --> 00:23:31,940
sended information get information

430
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:35,519
update things in the browser that's the

431
00:23:35,519 --> 00:23:39,200
next demo

432
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:59,080
okay so this is where we talk about the

433
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:01,000
connection between my client side stuff

434
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,370
you just saw in the server side stuff in

435
00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:05,049
this case we want clicking on the

436
00:24:05,049 --> 00:24:06,940
description to send a message to the

437
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:08,950
server it does some work and send a

438
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:19,570
result back this is my sandbox up the

439
00:24:19,570 --> 00:24:23,170
entire flown site and got quite a total

440
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:25,480
babe the easiest way to cheat on this is

441
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:27,880
to go hijack his module instead of

442
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,650
creating a brand new product and

443
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:31,900
registering is all that so I'm going to

444
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:35,710
go down into VC SDK SS package find a

445
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:37,870
little configuration point I jacket and

446
00:24:37,870 --> 00:24:40,660
wire all this time in this case the

447
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:43,660
configuration point I'm hijacking is the

448
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:46,120
configuration language for so-called zc

449
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:50,440
ml generation markup language this is

450
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:52,510
what one of those files looks like and

451
00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:56,679
I'm going to add in some directives what

452
00:24:56,679 --> 00:24:59,010
this directive is doing is adding

453
00:24:59,010 --> 00:25:07,780
essentially adding a new URL so so so

454
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:09,400
the URLs going to be registered for

455
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:12,640
instances of that content type I say

456
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:15,910
content type but I won't explain the

457
00:25:15,910 --> 00:25:18,850
difference this is the name of the URL

458
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:22,678
and that's the code in this better run

459
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:26,740
since it points to a python module will

460
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:28,870
open up Python pausing paste some stuff

461
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:30,460
into what they thought told me the

462
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:30,950
pace

463
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:44,750
understand like I'm getting my screen on

464
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:47,169
this side

465
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:10,870
okay so over the python module a pretty

466
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:13,270
small amount of code for the amount of

467
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:17,080
stuff that is doing we get a subclass

468
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:20,680
from the word word that God has done for

469
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:24,880
us a view that handles the Mayan surfer

470
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,010
interaction this is the thing that

471
00:26:27,010 --> 00:26:29,620
handles the URL it's passed an argument

472
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:31,360
and does a little bit of work and then

473
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:35,740
insert magic here in packages up a it's

474
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:38,680
almost like X it sends a set of

475
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,360
instructions back to the next server it

476
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:43,649
tells it to do some stuff

477
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:02,470
okay so once we get that code though we

478
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:04,630
restart the server and we go check to

479
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:06,190
see if it works we're going to go and

480
00:27:06,190 --> 00:27:09,400
put a new url url are seized the middle

481
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:15,400
response and we did you see response one

482
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,350
out there you see the argument I asked

483
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:19,390
that Python method is the value for that

484
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:21,640
argument calculates the time on the

485
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:24,520
server and sends the stream back that

486
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:29,490
you here's the stranger passing on that

487
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:33,460
and that's where the imagine on this

488
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:35,830
side that's in the URL that's in the

489
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:38,380
query string the value of the Oracle

490
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:40,540
pretty straight that's good it there now

491
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:42,340
we know that the client side works we go

492
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:44,110
the server side works let's fire the two

493
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:46,870
up together and the wiring happens in

494
00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:50,440
that CSS language let's go back to that

495
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:53,169
CSS file then we're all 3 and s CSS file

496
00:27:53,169 --> 00:27:55,570
through the web browser we're going to

497
00:27:55,570 --> 00:27:57,040
open that thing up again we're going to

498
00:27:57,040 --> 00:28:00,250
put these extra directives that say when

499
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:03,370
I click on this node go and run this

500
00:28:03,370 --> 00:28:05,110
action on the server said that this

501
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:07,210
argument get its results back and do

502
00:28:07,210 --> 00:28:10,270
something and it took long to explain

503
00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:12,910
that in time not very large amount of

504
00:28:12,910 --> 00:28:15,450
that

505
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:25,590
and now as I reload the page and click

506
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:28,020
on it I'll get the alert box first

507
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:30,120
because that was the first direct that I

508
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:34,590
had but then the next thing was executed

509
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:37,350
is pretty interesting it went and found

510
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:40,080
another box on the page the brutal

511
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:43,380
actions box and a shove the results into

512
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:45,870
that portal action and the thing that

513
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:48,870
was saying go find this box is shut up

514
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:51,929
into it is actually the Python code on

515
00:28:51,929 --> 00:28:55,080
the server the Python code 2 degrees of

516
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:58,409
control of your browser and hold it what

517
00:28:58,409 --> 00:29:02,010
to do there you see on line 13 it's say

518
00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:04,230
I'm going to find that ID and do

519
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:07,200
something with it so that's the server

520
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:13,610
sign of ok SS back to the presentation

521
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:18,090
so the two benefits that you get

522
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:19,679
immediately from chaos that's the first

523
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:22,289
is they go fun my lashes the most of the

524
00:29:22,289 --> 00:29:24,270
work to make flown out of the box take

525
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:27,090
advantage of this i have another screen

526
00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:29,190
back off it on the site that shows using

527
00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:30,870
some of the special cells for example

528
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:34,770
you can go to the title on a page click

529
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:37,169
in it get the Endicott's save it and

530
00:29:37,169 --> 00:29:39,270
another box on the page will update

531
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:41,309
itself the recent changes box will

532
00:29:41,309 --> 00:29:43,529
update itself it will be totaled update

533
00:29:43,529 --> 00:29:46,260
itself and KSS and if you make a mistake

534
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:49,500
like putting an empty value in the form

535
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:51,480
air will happen without a trip to the

536
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:53,880
server to replace the page the other

537
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,860
things nice about it it's in addition to

538
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:58,950
having it be more useful I lost you as

539
00:29:58,950 --> 00:30:01,590
clone developers can beverages

540
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:05,139
applications easier way to do it with

541
00:30:05,139 --> 00:30:06,789
this declare this tile approach where

542
00:30:06,789 --> 00:30:08,019
you don't necessarily have to learn

543
00:30:08,019 --> 00:30:11,320
anything about JavaScript okay so that's

544
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:13,509
the age export on to the third important

545
00:30:13,509 --> 00:30:16,359
presentation about portlets done by

546
00:30:16,359 --> 00:30:22,149
these two guys that's that's a cool

547
00:30:22,149 --> 00:30:27,580
picture here what we want to shove in in

548
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:31,439
the club demo first

549
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:50,650
what we want to show is how free is

550
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:52,390
pleasure streets within a content

551
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:53,799
management system less of an Internet

552
00:30:53,799 --> 00:30:55,630
one of the big things for internets is

553
00:30:55,630 --> 00:30:58,179
portlets ability to collect information

554
00:30:58,179 --> 00:31:00,340
in the boxes on page and let users

555
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:02,500
manage those boxes to turn them on turn

556
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:05,169
them off whatever and so the portlet

557
00:31:05,169 --> 00:31:07,960
system for plone three tries to bring

558
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:10,059
some of these internet use cases into

559
00:31:10,059 --> 00:31:12,700
the world of plum and do so in an

560
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:15,340
architecturally sound way so rather than

561
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:17,440
writing portlet from scratch as part of

562
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,120
the screencast I'm going to build hijack

563
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,309
an example portlet and just make minor

564
00:31:21,309 --> 00:31:23,260
modification to it so I'm going to check

565
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:27,370
out that package into the box area of my

566
00:31:27,370 --> 00:31:31,270
phone developer site and once I get that

567
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:33,100
on Williams it opened it up and make

568
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:37,120
couple changes so here's my chronic side

569
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,779
i'm going to die down into my portlet

570
00:31:39,779 --> 00:31:47,409
the thing that i checked out in the

571
00:31:47,409 --> 00:31:50,169
configuration language for zope one of

572
00:31:50,169 --> 00:31:51,370
the interesting features is this

573
00:31:51,370 --> 00:31:54,520
expensable so instead of making people

574
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:56,320
do a lot of national work we wrote a

575
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,990
very specific directly only for the

576
00:31:58,990 --> 00:32:01,390
purpose of configuring a new portland

577
00:32:01,390 --> 00:32:05,130
has been made available to everybody

578
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:13,090
here is the user interface for that

579
00:32:13,090 --> 00:32:17,529
floodlit pretty simple and here's the

580
00:32:17,529 --> 00:32:20,049
code for that for look how it gathers up

581
00:32:20,049 --> 00:32:22,120
information in an actual user interface

582
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:25,120
we restart my server and go check and

583
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:29,340
see if I can use this portlet

584
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:35,140
for those of you might use clutter the

585
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:37,120
passion see a lot of error messages on

586
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,950
startup with deprecation warnings and

587
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:43,420
things that's been cleaned up a lot we

588
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:45,610
see on the right and the left we have

589
00:32:45,610 --> 00:32:48,250
examples of portlets we also have this

590
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:51,310
oh actually so the first thing you have

591
00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:53,200
to do is that's a new package that was

592
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,910
created we need to make it available to

593
00:32:54,910 --> 00:32:57,130
the this particular plum site so I'm

594
00:32:57,130 --> 00:33:00,220
going to go and small that package in my

595
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:03,970
corporate package is now available so i

596
00:33:03,970 --> 00:33:06,070
can use it in the portlet interface this

597
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:08,320
is one of the first benefits from the

598
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,900
portlet work that weren't in here did is

599
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:13,030
you have a web based approach that each

600
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:15,100
person or the site administrator can do

601
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:19,150
to change the portal you can reorder

602
00:33:19,150 --> 00:33:22,540
them using the KSS pajak stuff moving

603
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:24,370
them up and down on board I always turn

604
00:33:24,370 --> 00:33:26,500
off the calendar the first thing I did I

605
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:30,160
like two columns and I'm an important

606
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,780
that i'll add a portlet that i just

607
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:34,240
created in a low portlet it requires a

608
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,160
single thing for configuration which is

609
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:38,160
the message to display in this Portland

610
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:41,170
that was determined by the author the

611
00:33:41,170 --> 00:33:43,270
creativity portlet that Portland is now

612
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:46,750
available on every page of the site I go

613
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:49,120
back to the homepage and I'll see you

614
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:52,630
that load portland this is a neat thing

615
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:56,920
about their system their system we're

616
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,990
going to report 'let's is you can

617
00:33:58,990 --> 00:34:01,510
configure a portlet to appear in a

618
00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:04,270
certain column based on what group of

619
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:07,270
person is in so not everybody to see the

620
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:09,580
same thing what content type

621
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:11,320
looking at so if you're looking at a

622
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:13,300
news item don't show a portlet about

623
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:15,460
announcements and you can also set up

624
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:18,510
her to use importance

625
00:34:27,129 --> 00:34:29,049
now when I go back to the one of the

626
00:34:29,049 --> 00:34:31,259
pages of the site I will see the

627
00:34:31,259 --> 00:34:34,569
available the right Whitney message that

628
00:34:34,569 --> 00:34:40,719
I configured it to have so with this

629
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:43,899
approach the world of adding portlets

630
00:34:43,899 --> 00:34:45,969
and internet functionality is a lot more

631
00:34:45,969 --> 00:34:49,569
sane usable for humans instead of

632
00:34:49,569 --> 00:34:55,750
programmers and gets us into the path is

633
00:34:55,750 --> 00:34:58,089
starting to use of the new features in

634
00:34:58,089 --> 00:35:00,369
the world of zoeb specifically the

635
00:35:00,369 --> 00:35:04,240
sofrito architecture and finally the

636
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:06,339
world zone is starting to use the same

637
00:35:06,339 --> 00:35:08,740
college generic setup where you saw in

638
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:11,170
the KSS demo i went to click around on

639
00:35:11,170 --> 00:35:13,329
and added a bunch of stuff that was all

640
00:35:13,329 --> 00:35:15,549
really cool but what happens if i want

641
00:35:15,549 --> 00:35:17,289
to share it with someone else or we

642
00:35:17,289 --> 00:35:19,990
create a site later generic stuff is a

643
00:35:19,990 --> 00:35:21,789
way to do a bunch of figuration press

644
00:35:21,789 --> 00:35:23,710
the button get everything about your

645
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:26,380
configuration save to a file or checking

646
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:32,710
subversion running a little low on time

647
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:37,529
as far as demo so I will

648
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:48,440
so this is actually running fun locally

649
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:59,000
and for example this is going to end up

650
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:09,680
one of the pages on the this is KSS

651
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:14,569
angle right here so for example this is

652
00:36:14,569 --> 00:36:23,390
the inline editing of KSS I'm going to

653
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:31,760
change that Salem and the page changes

654
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:34,190
so what in line but also the recent

655
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:36,319
changes box was also told to change

656
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:39,099
itself and cause something happened

657
00:36:39,099 --> 00:36:42,950
without really changing the entire page

658
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:46,190
entire URL other things that are

659
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:50,180
available in flown three this is by far

660
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:54,440
the biggest thing I can make a bunch of

661
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:58,450
changes and then

662
00:37:03,099 --> 00:37:05,869
when I say that I have an option to do

663
00:37:05,869 --> 00:37:08,830
version control

664
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:22,760
which is a very important feature for

665
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:25,370
high-end content management systems to

666
00:37:25,370 --> 00:37:28,040
give any users the ability to do

667
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:30,320
fortunate and so you see all the words I

668
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:34,340
have and do fifth preferred an immersion

669
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:36,650
with the comic message through here this

670
00:37:36,650 --> 00:37:38,630
also configurable so you can do for

671
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:41,960
example auto versioning there's also a

672
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:44,150
system called aging which allows the

673
00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:47,270
public to see one type one version of

674
00:37:47,270 --> 00:37:48,740
all icons have all your content

675
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:54,890
resources 14 he has the system for a

676
00:37:54,890 --> 00:37:57,170
lake checking and validation I make a

677
00:37:57,170 --> 00:37:59,810
link from one page to another if i go to

678
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:02,720
try and delete the target of the link i

679
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,730
would get a warning that it's linked in

680
00:38:04,730 --> 00:38:06,680
from other pages and the confirmation

681
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:10,910
actually leave it by moving you a page

682
00:38:10,910 --> 00:38:13,010
from one place to another i go to the

683
00:38:13,010 --> 00:38:16,270
old URL be redirected to the new URL

684
00:38:16,270 --> 00:38:18,830
wiki functionality right and put the

685
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:21,200
little friends around phrases and just

686
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,790
in the middle of a page not a special

687
00:38:22,790 --> 00:38:24,950
content type so what's really nice about

688
00:38:24,950 --> 00:38:27,530
this is i had a purchase order content

689
00:38:27,530 --> 00:38:30,140
type that I wrote myself put a rich text

690
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:31,550
field in the middle of it and it will

691
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:35,150
get wiki functionality just because this

692
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:38,690
week week the wiki system is available

693
00:38:38,690 --> 00:38:42,520
for anything that has a rich text field

694
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:49,690
also indexing them office content using

695
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:53,230
the WB where libraries several other

696
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:56,860
features so that's a little bit of home

697
00:38:56,860 --> 00:39:00,630
three any time about five minutes left

698
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:06,540
it's all of these schedules important

699
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:19,150
and we're going to have you think i

700
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:23,560
imprinted earlier so this is a little

701
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:26,829
over one group for developers a little

702
00:39:26,829 --> 00:39:29,140
bit of the user features as well what's

703
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:32,440
coming beyond bohn three the next

704
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:35,940
release 13.5 slated for later this year

705
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:38,230
bottle architectural stuff will happen

706
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:40,510
on it same thing as a release page i

707
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:42,490
showed you before there are these plants

708
00:39:42,490 --> 00:39:43,990
that are being written and scheduled

709
00:39:43,990 --> 00:39:47,490
that release performance for example is

710
00:39:47,490 --> 00:39:50,800
important for 13.5 actually some good

711
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:53,380
things happening for you there are also

712
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:54,880
some of things happening in those

713
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:57,040
involved in yesterday that are happening

714
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:59,440
in our community oakland with other

715
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:02,980
music a little bit beyond code from fun

716
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:06,150
three for future things happening in fun

717
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:08,829
some of us are starting to get involved

718
00:40:08,829 --> 00:40:12,940
with some EU activities face around fall

719
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:16,109
software having to do with quality

720
00:40:16,109 --> 00:40:18,760
measurements of the kinds of metrics and

721
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:22,210
how this can establish a sense of

722
00:40:22,210 --> 00:40:24,750
maturity about open source for

723
00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:27,480
governments to make evaluations but also

724
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:30,060
commerce in europe to make evaluations

725
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:32,589
the projects that were presented

726
00:40:32,589 --> 00:40:34,450
yesterday that we're involved with a

727
00:40:34,450 --> 00:40:37,089
little bit they're all about collecting

728
00:40:37,089 --> 00:40:39,400
metrics like the information doing

729
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:42,520
really rigorous analysis of that finding

730
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:45,099
out what are the trends how can we how

731
00:40:45,099 --> 00:40:47,710
do we establish the difference between a

732
00:40:47,710 --> 00:40:49,780
quality project and high quality low

733
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:52,359
quality project where is the case things

734
00:40:52,359 --> 00:40:56,230
and all of this is i view all this is

735
00:40:56,230 --> 00:40:57,910
important in things that we should talk

736
00:40:57,910 --> 00:41:02,410
about within our communities because we

737
00:41:02,410 --> 00:41:06,460
want to succeed beyond each other we all

738
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:08,720
know that it's good how do we convince a

739
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,910
people that's good unfortunately if

740
00:41:10,910 --> 00:41:13,010
voter architectures are not the best way

741
00:41:13,010 --> 00:41:15,410
to convince a decision-maker to a doctor

742
00:41:15,410 --> 00:41:18,740
software there is unbelievably some

743
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:23,060
skepticism out there about how we do

744
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:26,510
what we do and it just takes a while it

745
00:41:26,510 --> 00:41:28,400
takes things that we don't know how to

746
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:31,730
do very well in order for us to mature

747
00:41:31,730 --> 00:41:35,540
beyond our natural allies how we reach

748
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:39,110
some of these skeptics and the way I

749
00:41:39,110 --> 00:41:42,620
look at it is we involve these projects

750
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:46,340
we need to make a decision to engage

751
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:47,900
some of these activities that

752
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:49,850
participate because it's good for us we

753
00:41:49,850 --> 00:41:52,010
alone will then be able to reach these

754
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:53,750
people convince them they hate

755
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:57,230
revolution they like safe measure

756
00:41:57,230 --> 00:41:59,810
approaches some of these projects are

757
00:41:59,810 --> 00:42:02,150
doing the work for us they want to help

758
00:42:02,150 --> 00:42:04,070
us they are commenting once I come to us

759
00:42:04,070 --> 00:42:05,810
and say less do it for you you don't

760
00:42:05,810 --> 00:42:07,820
have to do anything all you have to do

761
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:10,340
is let us help you so you get a chance

762
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:12,350
to work with so these projects and talk

763
00:42:12,350 --> 00:42:13,970
with them in other presentations like

764
00:42:13,970 --> 00:42:18,440
this do because i think it's it's the

765
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:20,000
kind of thing that resources are always

766
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,220
good at strategic kinds of things how do

767
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:24,230
you see the big picture how do you do

768
00:42:24,230 --> 00:42:26,300
things that make an impact farther out

769
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:28,190
these are the people that are doing it

770
00:42:28,190 --> 00:42:29,900
for us particularly in the Inuits

771
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:33,710
important if we help them get involved

772
00:42:33,710 --> 00:42:35,990
inside of our projects they will do the

773
00:42:35,990 --> 00:42:39,020
work to help us explain outside of these

774
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:44,630
walls for so the on to the best word for

775
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:47,860
eating presentation England Collegium

776
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:50,240
that's that would be the URL bonus

777
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:53,480
material 13 is coming luxury is

778
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:55,970
available now should be in data within

779
00:42:55,970 --> 00:42:56,620
the next

780
00:42:56,620 --> 00:42:59,320
always should be released sometime in

781
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:01,840
May you'll note that i have to say of

782
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:06,790
what year in phone continues with 13 the

783
00:43:06,790 --> 00:43:10,240
world alone continues to grow up from a

784
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:12,130
future perspective it's growing up with

785
00:43:12,130 --> 00:43:15,210
things like versioning and staging which

786
00:43:15,210 --> 00:43:19,090
are usually part of the high-end domain

787
00:43:19,090 --> 00:43:22,690
content management systems it's growing

788
00:43:22,690 --> 00:43:25,720
up in terms of how views itself in the

789
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:28,390
larger world of its stack with ease of

790
00:43:28,390 --> 00:43:30,310
application server I'm on programming

791
00:43:30,310 --> 00:43:33,430
language we're trying to do work at the

792
00:43:33,430 --> 00:43:35,500
right level of the stack getting

793
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:37,270
involved with eggs getting involved so

794
00:43:37,270 --> 00:43:41,110
free trying to grow up a little bit on

795
00:43:41,110 --> 00:43:44,020
the legal front one foundation is really

796
00:43:44,020 --> 00:43:48,790
interesting as the we try to manage the

797
00:43:48,790 --> 00:43:50,650
group rights for everyone in phone

798
00:43:50,650 --> 00:43:53,050
protective mode plumbing so we have

799
00:43:53,050 --> 00:43:58,360
around 92 members board of directors in

800
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:01,330
existence for four years have about 35

801
00:44:01,330 --> 00:44:05,680
grand and debate and we own the

802
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:07,780
copyright for plug we can speak on

803
00:44:07,780 --> 00:44:14,140
behalf of one and that is unfortunately

804
00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:16,270
the content management world there are

805
00:44:16,270 --> 00:44:18,400
so many content management products I

806
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:20,910
swear to god during my presentation

807
00:44:20,910 --> 00:44:23,200
somebody wrote the content management

808
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:31,510
system and published it and it might be

809
00:44:31,510 --> 00:44:34,380
good but I doubt the world means a

810
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:36,850
12,000 and first content management

811
00:44:36,850 --> 00:44:39,490
system so as some of the content

812
00:44:39,490 --> 00:44:40,960
management systems get bigger drupal's

813
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:45,550
after me some of the ones at the top you

814
00:44:45,550 --> 00:44:47,440
start to see us invest

815
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:50,079
eight things more less about home more

816
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:52,000
about maturity more about legal stuff

817
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,119
the people involved with drupal and

818
00:44:55,119 --> 00:44:57,099
joomla and some of the other systems we

819
00:44:57,099 --> 00:44:59,200
all work with each other about sharing

820
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:00,940
information on how to run foundations

821
00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:04,390
for example and I knew that mortgage

822
00:45:04,390 --> 00:45:07,660
just as important as code because we

823
00:45:07,660 --> 00:45:10,420
want what what we do is so good we got

824
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:12,280
to share with other people and those

825
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:14,349
people care about things like that it

826
00:45:14,349 --> 00:45:16,420
violated the plum community continues to

827
00:45:16,420 --> 00:45:18,640
grow I got invited to speak in Japan

828
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:21,520
next month so the more it grows in

829
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:26,349
places like it to go so if you're

830
00:45:26,349 --> 00:45:28,270
interested in content management if

831
00:45:28,270 --> 00:45:31,359
you're interested in big communities

832
00:45:31,359 --> 00:45:34,839
lots of fun a project with a logo that

833
00:45:34,839 --> 00:45:37,599
has its own color Norwegian blue and a

834
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:39,910
logo that looks like a scanning and

835
00:45:39,910 --> 00:45:44,470
lights and good content management then

836
00:45:44,470 --> 00:45:46,990

837
00:45:46,990 --> 00:45:49,599

838
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:57,310
