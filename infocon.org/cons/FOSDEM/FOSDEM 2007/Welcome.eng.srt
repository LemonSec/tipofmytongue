1
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,280
hello hello

2
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,679
before i let ruff welcome you to fosdem

3
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:15,839
i need to say my yearly two words about

4
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:17,440
the beer last night

5
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,520
i'm guilty for organizing it for the

6
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,199
seventh time now

7
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:23,519
we broke all records we had a total beer

8
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:26,720
bill of 5130 euro

9
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,880
despite closing the bar an hour earlier

10
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,720
than usual because some people were

11
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,599
throwing things

12
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:34,559
and it's probably safer not to let geeks

13
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:35,680
get harmed

14
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,520
i want to thank everyone who showed up

15
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,280
and who behaved

16
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,120
and i want to see you again next year

17
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,200
for more beer when we tried my beer

18
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,680
distribution algorithm version 3

19
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,680
which will be worked out uh sometime in

20
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,000
