1
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:38,559
so my goal is survive hopefully the

2
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:41,470
answer regardlessly question and truth

3
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:43,570
be told I came on biggest i to myself

4
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:46,449
it's slightly arrogant but someone in

5
00:00:46,449 --> 00:00:52,030
the community decidedly uses neither way

6
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:54,549
I hope throughout this presentation I'll

7
00:00:54,549 --> 00:00:57,820
be able to to tell you explain you why

8
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:02,379
drupal coming for many use cases that's

9
00:01:02,379 --> 00:01:06,369
not to say that was always a problem I'm

10
00:01:06,369 --> 00:01:09,790
a firm believer of the fact that you

11
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:13,530
should use right tool for the right job

12
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:20,430
that's it let's get started first of all

13
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:23,700
by then HT student at the University

14
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:27,420
my work focuses on Java Java Virtual

15
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:31,490
Machines people by their level so it's

16
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:34,409
it's low level of compiler technologies

17
00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:36,570
and then by night I'm working on

18
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:38,369
football and be founded on the project

19
00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:40,619
and also the project page and of course

20
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:44,280
release all written in PHP so there's

21
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:50,850
two long as it works in my life first of

22
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:54,569
all buddies people this filter cake last

23
00:01:54,569 --> 00:02:04,560
year try to adjust better so we hadn't

24
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,299
had a food class there may be sort of

25
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:08,579
Commerce the boots so there was a spare

26
00:02:08,579 --> 00:02:15,269
table I don't know who wrote these or

27
00:02:15,269 --> 00:02:17,160
who made this particular size to be

28
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,170
quite I Prasad I decided to use it for

29
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:23,130
his presentation so it says Drupal is a

30
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:26,519
PHP page ms or a web application

31
00:02:26,519 --> 00:02:31,139
framework or the community website and

32
00:02:31,139 --> 00:02:35,280
it's also really performs in line Ajax

33

36
00:02:45,299 --> 00:02:50,160
you can see the price porch so really do

37
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,709
please do things on the one hand it's a

38
00:02:52,709 --> 00:02:54,780
common management system which means

39
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:56,620
that users can

40
00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:00,190
install it to get a science real quick

41
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:02,799
and on the other hand it's also web

42
00:03:02,799 --> 00:03:05,440
application framework meaning that it's

43
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,180
more in the pool to developers they come

44
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:10,269
down they can create additional module

45
00:03:10,269 --> 00:03:13,840
straighten up functionality centralia g

46
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:19,269

00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:51,849
dark if this picture was taken at

54
00:03:51,849 --> 00:03:54,549
teachable conference this summer which

55
00:03:54,549 --> 00:03:57,670
was helping Brussels I think by the 15

56
00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:01,569
able showed up of which I guess ten

57
00:04:01,569 --> 00:04:03,900
percent were sufficiently where it from

58
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:10,599
really we're also fast growing community

59
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:12,790
you look at a number of post on the

60
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:14,620
website you see that in growing

61
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:24,310
exponentially our main website does more

62
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:27,940
than 10 million a few months in a row

63
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:30,160
bites one or two there by traffic and

64
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,110
that's you know our website you know

65
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:34,930
that is very boring it's there's almost

66
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:42,639
no references playing thanks it's how

67
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:47,289
much plain text which really love me in

68
00:04:47,289 --> 00:04:49,090
trouble cause that's own pony for the

69
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:52,000
for the poor which it means to be

70
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,789
downloaded by eighteen thousand times of

71
00:04:54,789 --> 00:04:58,090
us and on the website wave pass other

72
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:02,169
productions registered users we also

73
00:05:02,169 --> 00:05:04,360
have a showing in on the ecosystem when

74
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:07,630
we just started pretty much all in users

75
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:10,570
are also developers and over time change

76
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:16,000
now more users than web developers we

77
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,860
also hosting companies through being a

78
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:22,990
full-time professor to give you an idea

79
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:25,599
surveillance monitoring eating companies

80
00:05:25,599 --> 00:05:27,760
which do nothing but google sites and

81
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,560
there's more than 50 individual

82
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:34,690
consultants but most of all a very

83
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:36,400
active and passionate community in

84
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,340
organized conferences we organize five

85
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:41,800
conferences the last two years ever

86
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,969
currently organizing

87
00:05:42,969 --> 00:05:45,339

make cakes and cookies into the shaker

93
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:03,429
over which i think is a good sign for

94
00:06:03,429 --> 00:06:05,199
the fact that many of us are passionate

95
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:10,229
about what we do what you stand for and

96
00:06:11,339 --> 00:06:15,849

126
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:42,479
KD v zilla definitely do at one or more

127

google sites it's not always their main

128
00:07:45,419 --> 00:07:46,889
site of course that they are various

129
00:07:46,889 --> 00:07:50,940
project utiful universities in the

130
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:54,110
interval in belgium of major university

131
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:57,060
lemon or google sites but also as the

132
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:00,900
university estates broadcast companies

133
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:04,289

there is purple making myspace blown may

137
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:21,060
be seen shooting for a podcast site can

138
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:26,250
also your internet website Hey Ya let's

139
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:29,909
go build part of their internets on

140
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:38,279
google like classic NATO the United

141
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:41,309
Nations had one or more people sites as

142
00:08:41,309 --> 00:08:49,380
you can see the screenshots simple for

143
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:51,029
those who don't know that the baby's a

144
00:08:51,029 --> 00:08:53,750
 is one of the biggest Belgium

145
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:59,430
websites and it's a block genocide so if

146
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:02,850
your house you probably notice i also

147
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:08,100
rock stars usable entitled Moby site is

148
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:12,120
entirely new group is journal but also

149
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,250
collection or an overview of all these

150
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:19,079
TVs takes my place but most importantly

151
00:09:19,079 --> 00:09:20,910
most of the new casaya

152
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:23,250
actually small and simple and often

153
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:31,020
boring websites like mine that's really

154
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:33,030
the cool thing about Drupal that it's

155
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:35,160
really accessible to so many people and

156
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:38,250
the fact that it's empowering so many

157
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:42,510
people to build simple websites for

158
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:45,060
example the other day I pump into a

159
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:47,610
website which was created by school

160
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:52,050
teachers to do you know Hilda cyclery

161
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:54,660
students and that's to me that's really

162
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:57,000
not more important than all the big

163
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,790
sites i just mention report so the

164
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:01,650
mission really is that we're building

165
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:05,490
technology everyone to bring multi-user

166
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:10,980
interactive website and all these sites

167
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:12,930
i just listed and the examples I gave

168
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:15,150
are really investment to the fact that

169
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:18,900
nobody from just a CMS parent is really

170
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:21,690
a comment management framework because

171
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:23,610
you can take in so many different

172
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:26,610
directions and create so many different

173
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:30,600
sites in the area where we are really

174
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,420
strong in the upper right for various

175
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:38,100
what society and typically many

176
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:43,830
computing lives so how are you how many

177
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:48,530
of you as a true size

178
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:58,100
right you so let's have a closer look at

179
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:07,370
the 22 platform so drupal uses a lance

180
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:09,529
time what this means that you need some

181
00:11:09,529 --> 00:11:14,450
sort of platform yet Archer can be any

182
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:16,459
arbitrarily and on top of the hardware

183
00:11:16,459 --> 00:11:19,670
you need an operating system we tell me

184
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:24,589
linux solaris windows this one of the

185
00:11:24,589 --> 00:11:28,510
operating system in EDM is typically

186
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:31,670
possible sites use mexico might as well

187
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:35,029
but we also support postgres there's

188
00:11:35,029 --> 00:11:37,930
people working on oracle and db2

189
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:40,160
attraction layers and the database

190
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:43,760
really makes up the comp asleep so

191
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,740
that's where all my data and the content

192
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:48,320
is actually stored and you also need a

193
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,410
web server typically again most people

194
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:53,810
use apache with 12 password microsoft

195
00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:56,870
server or lightning or any other web

196
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:59,690
server and i believe of course page in

197
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:05,060
can be PHP forum or php5 both working

198
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:07,399
and then on top of that you actually

199
00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:09,770
have to load which indicated loop and

200
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:12,260
rupal itself consists of three marks

201
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:15,529
years into before the base functionality

202
00:12:15,529 --> 00:12:18,019
building works and on top of that you

203
00:12:18,019 --> 00:12:19,970
have functionality and the functionality

204
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:22,279
is provided by much but it might just

205
00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:24,949
make the clarification there and then

206
00:12:24,949 --> 00:12:27,589
I'm not of that esds and it deems you

207
00:12:27,589 --> 00:12:30,259
find you can feel at our site so that's

208
00:12:30,259 --> 00:12:34,160
a presentation there so one of the

209
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,689
questions I often guess especially

210
00:12:35,689 --> 00:12:38,360
because I'm also doing a lots of Java

211
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:42,850
work for my day job is 5-htp a nut job

212
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:45,829
and the answer hearing is that PHP is

213
00:12:45,829 --> 00:12:48,220
made for the web so it has lots of

214
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:53,420
useful and convenient functions to write

215
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:56,059
authority and also because i think that

216
00:12:56,059 --> 00:12:59,110
a sun-filled nature accessible

217
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:05,360
especially my years old now no matter

218
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,249
how you look or better with each be

219
00:13:07,249 --> 00:13:09,019
hosting is typically a lot cheaper than

220
00:13:09,019 --> 00:13:11,269
kind of a boutique where it needs it

221
00:13:11,269 --> 00:13:16,939
used to be plus piece for people or even

222
00:13:16,939 --> 00:13:19,579
if it's much easier cooler on that HP

223
00:13:19,579 --> 00:13:22,699
and fuller job of course that also has

224
00:13:22,699 --> 00:13:26,180
drawbacks but I honestly believe that

225
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:30,129
even kiss them for evil to be built by a

226
00:13:30,129 --> 00:13:34,879
move and I think that's quite HP so

227
00:13:34,879 --> 00:13:41,779
successful so say want to build a

228
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:43,569
company website how are you were

229
00:13:43,569 --> 00:13:46,850
essentially you wins just enable a set

230
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:49,100
of modules you would enable the static

231
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,779
page module so you can create study

232
00:13:50,779 --> 00:13:54,769
phase you might want to enable file

233
00:13:54,769 --> 00:13:57,889
upload module so you can upload files so

234
00:13:57,889 --> 00:14:01,129
people say nite 12 labels contact module

235
00:14:01,129 --> 00:14:03,920
or the e-commerce module to provide a

236
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,139
complex form into cell page of your

237
00:14:06,139 --> 00:14:08,179
website so you want to make the

238
00:14:08,179 --> 00:14:10,009
discussion website in just the name of

239
00:14:10,009 --> 00:14:12,050
the different set of modules so in this

240
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:15,379
case for example you would enable the

241
00:14:15,379 --> 00:14:17,959
portal module in profile much other than

242
00:14:17,959 --> 00:14:20,389
common module so you could have

243
00:14:20,389 --> 00:14:22,339
discussions on your website needs of

244
00:14:22,339 --> 00:14:27,410
people the users of their site boots no

245
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:29,509
big wigs that provide a profile about

246
00:14:29,509 --> 00:14:34,759
the picture of themselves mention the of

247
00:14:34,759 --> 00:14:37,699
the URL at their website support now

248
00:14:37,699 --> 00:14:38,809
when you want to create a company

249
00:14:38,809 --> 00:14:41,839
website that also has a discussion area

250
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:45,439
just enable all those so that's really

251
00:14:45,439 --> 00:14:48,889
how it works you just think you know you

252
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:51,589
just paint the modest one to enable them

253
00:14:51,589 --> 00:14:53,959
and then you have to do some

254
00:14:53,959 --> 00:14:55,399
configurations you need to get

255
00:14:55,399 --> 00:14:59,720
everything to work together and the

256
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:02,089
whole thing is that right now we have

257
00:15:02,089 --> 00:15:04,639
over a thousand a different modules you

258
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:06,170
can download and install so there's

259
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:08,509
really a lot of functionality already

260
00:15:08,509 --> 00:15:13,220
provided vital community so if people

261
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:15,290
want to create a complex web site or a

262
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:18,860
simple website it usually goes you know

263
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:20,750
we just typically spend a lot of time

264
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:23,600
investigating all the financials once

265
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,000
you figure out which module to use we

266
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,050
can actually set up

267
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:30,560
drupal site in one or two days and then

268
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,320
on top of that we'll spend a couple more

269
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:37,760
days or sometimes longer to actually get

270
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:41,000
the last 5% plate as well in that

271
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,329
involves for example teaming customizing

272
00:15:44,329 --> 00:15:49,850
you know making it all fits but in

273
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:51,320
general if you want if you have a

274
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,149
customer for example and you want to do

275
00:15:53,149 --> 00:15:55,850
a prototype it's really easy to do a

276
00:15:55,850 --> 00:16:02,050
quick prototype here is another example

277
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:07,579
okay so say we start with the story

278
00:16:07,579 --> 00:16:10,190
known type which is provided by storing

279
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:12,620
my challenge a story is really a basic

280
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:15,100
content type it hasn't title and a body

281
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,600
doesn't alter a couple of other things

282
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,260
it's really a very basic type and say

283
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:23,990
you won say they believe in that module

284
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:27,200
which is a module provided becomes you

285
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,420
believe in fostering and all of a sudden

286
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:31,970
you're able to associate days with your

287
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:34,100
story so we can associate a start date

288
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:36,529
and end date Peter sorry and so you

289
00:16:36,529 --> 00:16:40,760
invent enable that story it also means

290
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:46,430
that they're able to show or to provide

291
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:50,170
the type of heat or some other piece of

292
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:53,920
all the story of each region of

293
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:58,010
that module also provides these kind of

294
00:16:58,010 --> 00:17:01,520
things prevnext say one tornado

295
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,380
colocation Marshall then all of a sudden

296
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:05,030
you're also able to associate a

297
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:08,150
geolocation information with your story

298
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:13,460
and you're able to show you're able to

299
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:17,660
show where their story with the we think

300
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:19,849
they may explain application approval

301
00:17:19,849 --> 00:17:22,069
and integration for example which allows

302
00:17:22,069 --> 00:17:26,690
you to visualize hotel now net next say

303
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:29,000
you want to enable the assignment much

304
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,280
of the novel the sudden are able to

305
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:34,040
register for your event ok so they can

306
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,780
say whether they want to attend forums

307
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:38,630
allows me for example when you enable

308
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:40,490
the e-commerce point hope you're able to

309
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:44,150
30 into a gown for inside where people

310
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:47,360
have to pay for the average face up by

311
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,370
enabling these modules and change em

312
00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:52,930
together you cannot build powerful

313
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:57,590
websites then as an example the

314
00:17:57,590 --> 00:17:59,390
impulsive website itself is built in

315
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:01,940
trouble they also can I tell people

316
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:04,610
stuff like that I don't I've never been

317
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:06,170
involved in that so I don't know whether

318
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:08,240
they need whether they hit to right

319
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:19,040
favor I think that is ok so the jungle

320
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:22,160
almost every piece of content is what we

321
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,850
call a notes so no really a base from

322
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:28,430
which all all the other compensation

323
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:32,310
right a little bit like programming

324
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:35,720
articles reviews they're all right from

325
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:40,170
the bass drum type and a node system

326
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:42,480
which deals with these notes provides

327
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,850
abstraction on the one hand for the air

328
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:47,970
so every node has a number of cotton

329
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:49,680
fields like every piece of content in

330
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:52,170
the system has a daughter as a gauge has

331
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:55,740
an ID but also on every kind of dominant

332
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:58,710
system you want to perform a number of

333
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:02,010
operations ok so you want to publish

334
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:05,610
come then provide workflow and access

335
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:07,770
control all now content and the node

336
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:13,110
system abstracts all that and then given

337
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:16,020
the node system modules can extend the

338
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:22,370
known system in two ways the either

339
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:27,690
module scan the inner modules can

340
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:30,030
provide you know types which are the

341
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:33,420
great of bars against like form of

342
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:35,850
ecstatic patience wanted a physically

343
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:37,680
extension every day and then for

344
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:42,060
autosequence cross cuts across all these

345
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:44,610
different no tightness functionality of

346
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:48,870
that for example the module can provide

347
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:52,800
a full functionality and attach it with

348
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:56,490
any of these common types and then you

349
00:19:56,490 --> 00:19:59,160
can configure which no type are affected

350
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:02,940
by that much of so you don't have to use

351
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:05,190
that other examples are tried back and

352
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:11,010
email subscriptions for example so

353
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:12,540
here's another example say the node

354
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:14,730
module as I explained by default

355
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:18,420
functionality and default fields like

356
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:21,030
type over body in and Einstein and you

357
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:22,710
can able to recite module four

358
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:24,809
and all of a sudden you're able to

359
00:20:24,809 --> 00:20:27,960
associate one or more ingredients clear

360
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:32,279
from don't I say we come to reside under

361
00:20:32,279 --> 00:20:37,190
18 module allows you to score every site

362
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:39,570
and I for example the common module

363
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:42,539
allows people to have comments to every

364
00:20:42,539 --> 00:20:46,440
site so that's really how it works I'm

365
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:49,679
Rasta something called cck which stands

366
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:51,990
for the company instructions okay so I

367
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:57,480
guys late modules extends the note the

368
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:00,809
nose in Drupal and there is little

369
00:21:00,809 --> 00:21:03,679
difference or fish and still do is by

370
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,179
trading a module which involves

371
00:21:06,179 --> 00:21:09,620
programming PHP to extend something on

372
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:13,620
again the CCP or the golden construction

373
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:15,289
kit provides the user interface

374
00:21:15,289 --> 00:21:18,960
interface which allows you to create new

375
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:22,830
dreams and associate this with no so

376
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:24,210
this means you no longer have to be a

377
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:26,220
programmer to create your content types

378
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:28,980
in the system okay so that's one of our

379
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:33,330
most we're slowly integrate with this

380
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:37,230
functionality into football and then

381
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:40,649
even with the cck can still add other

382
00:21:40,649 --> 00:21:44,039
modules which has fails or functionality

383
00:21:44,039 --> 00:21:46,700
to notes

384
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:52,340
Oh case of the note system is a single

385
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:54,560
piece of functionality in Google Earth

386
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:58,310
lots of other building blocks which I

387
00:21:58,310 --> 00:22:01,850
can't explain all in this presentation

388
00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:03,980
but essentially we have a database

389
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:07,720
abstraction layer visualize you to write

390
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:13,100
CPU SQL queries we have support for

391
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:15,410
cleaner else which allows you to score

392
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:18,170
high in google and other search engines

393
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:20,990
we have for copulation and we have full

394
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:24,050
unicode support we have session handling

395
00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:26,330
localization which allows you to

396
00:22:26,330 --> 00:22:29,540
translate your user interface but also

397
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:34,820
your contents we are filing validation

398
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:39,550
we have permissions where it can assign

399
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:43,280
roles to users and then you assign

400
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:47,120
permissions to these user roles we have

401
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,670
support for user and parents locking and

402
00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:51,320
things like that so we really try to

403
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:53,960
make it easy for developers to get

404
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:57,020
started to build web applications really

405
00:22:57,020 --> 00:23:01,820
free there is just one example which is

406
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:03,350
the user management system which is

407
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:06,290
parson we provide secure session

408
00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:08,080
management it's also implement

409
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:12,050
innovation going in using to scale the

410
00:23:12,050 --> 00:23:15,640
session handling registration

411
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:18,280
people can create accounts we have

412
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:23,680
optional a notification database wait

413
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:27,520
passions are always promote regular

414
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:31,780
permissions user profiles ldap

415
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:34,060
integration as once the list of features

416
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:37,020
and functionality is really really long

417
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:41,080
and it's it's very difficult to uh well

418
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:43,690
it's it's impossible to explain all this

419
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:47,080
unit 131 session but a point in that are

420
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:48,910
dysfunctional gates typically available

421
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:55,720
it's very easy paper mix so next once

422
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:59,860
provided here 505 is the latest coupons

423
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:01,930
early so it's actually available we

424
00:24:01,930 --> 00:24:07,570
released its 12 months ago I think more

425
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:09,910
like one month ago and so far we had

426
00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:18,730
lots of positive feedback about it so

427
00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:20,560
what whether you may change into book

428
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:24,790
life first of all we if you haven't make

429
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:28,300
it if you very useful tuple 40 and you

430
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:31,690
switch near 45 typically you would have

431
00:24:31,690 --> 00:24:34,030
you know you wouldn't be surprised

432
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:36,150
because we really made a lot of pismo

433
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:40,090
changes so we're ego italy station

434
00:24:40,090 --> 00:24:43,720
please we had at a web-based installer

435
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:46,330
we're all which also does require

436
00:24:46,330 --> 00:24:48,400
injecting this was always typically one

437
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:51,430
of the main criticisms we bounce that

438
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:54,430
XXX hard to install and use so both

439
00:24:54,430 --> 00:24:57,430
these two items shouldn't they can get a

440
00:24:57,430 --> 00:25:01,660
lot of these please we also integrated

441
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:05,340
the javascript library we choose jquery

442
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:07,410
other JavaScript I

443
00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:10,920
it's really small and easy to use we

444
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:13,590
have a new party we also made lots of

445
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:16,310
performance and bandwidth improvements

446
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:19,200
we started integrating as support for

447
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,660
custom content types which is the season

448
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:25,590
cave the common construction kids being

449
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:28,800
proved the module management and the

450
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,650
block system through things like that

451
00:25:30,650 --> 00:25:41,460
let me see okay so this is what he gets

452
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:43,590
after you install Drupal in starting

453
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:46,920
Drupal we have installed shield now

454
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,410
install system it takes about two or

455
00:25:49,410 --> 00:25:51,600
three steps and a couple of linked sites

456
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,910
really easy and once you install Drupal

457
00:25:53,910 --> 00:25:56,370
the handle on this page and it

458
00:25:56,370 --> 00:26:00,450
essentially welcomes you ask you to

459
00:26:00,450 --> 00:26:02,940
create first user account which alguna

460
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:05,370
the first user account in Drupal is a

461
00:26:05,370 --> 00:26:09,650
little bit special it has user ID 1 and

462
00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:12,930
it always has all the access rights so

463
00:26:12,930 --> 00:26:16,010
it's sort of a super user

464
00:26:21,730 --> 00:26:27,670
I hope it works so as we do because you

465
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:30,070
are use one year old girl already given

466
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:33,880
your password on the screen but for all

467
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:37,260
other users the password will be emailed

468
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:40,930
well change the balls are just to be

469
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:46,960
sure so now I just changed the password

470
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:51,190
and you can go back to the main page and

471
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:53,500
read those instructions the station is

472
00:26:53,500 --> 00:27:00,120
now I'm lucky you see the Reserve chair

473
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:10,330
you see there is a new menu it has an

474
00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:12,610
administering which you can follow me if

475
00:27:12,610 --> 00:27:17,020
you only administering you make up the

476
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:20,050
administration pages okay so one of the

477
00:27:20,050 --> 00:27:23,500
things you'll notice with nice there's a

478
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:27,070
red part which usually means that things

479
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:30,310
happen if you click the link you'll see

480
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:33,460
a complete stage support so like I

481
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:35,320
mentioned installed also this

482
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,630
requirement checking whenever you go to

483
00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:40,150
the administration page it will it will

484
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:42,580
recheck all of the required requirements

485
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:45,520
so if someone down uated PHP or upgraded

486
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:48,040
some other service in the system which

487
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:50,920
my accident accidentally greater system

488
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:54,370
you'll be notified and on top of that it

489
00:27:54,370 --> 00:27:58,570
also gives you some other information

490
00:27:58,570 --> 00:28:01,780
like as you can see here certain

491
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:06,350
functionality in the website needs GD GD

492
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:09,760
available so it's completing about that

493
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:12,650
normally you would go over to fix them

494
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:15,140
one after another but let's go back to

495
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:19,100
the mound administration page one of the

496
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:22,010
things you see that we try to categorize

497
00:28:22,010 --> 00:28:23,990
all the functionality in different

498
00:28:23,990 --> 00:28:26,179
blocks so we have common management we

499
00:28:26,179 --> 00:28:28,039
have site building we have site

500
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:30,410
configuration copy of user management

501
00:28:30,410 --> 00:28:35,240
and logging and under that we have lots

502
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:39,110
of power there are other links which is

503
00:28:39,110 --> 00:28:41,710
point two different different kinds of

504
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:44,510
functionality so that's what the

505
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:50,510
administration page looks like one of

506
00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:52,789
the things you can do for example is you

507
00:28:52,789 --> 00:28:56,090
can create new content by default race

508
00:28:56,090 --> 00:28:58,010
only through content types enabled which

509
00:28:58,010 --> 00:29:01,580
is story page story stick pro to the

510
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:03,289
main page and allows you to create a

511
00:29:03,289 --> 00:29:05,750
blog or a slideshow style discussion or

512
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:12,049
games website so for example and just

513
00:29:12,049 --> 00:29:15,289
type it the title in the body there's

514
00:29:15,289 --> 00:29:18,230
all kinds of settings here you can also

515
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:20,510
install it as a menu which I'll show you

516
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:23,750
in a minute you can control whether

517
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:27,850
comments should be enabled or disabled

518
00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:33,440
you can change the altar and it uses

519
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:36,860
normal to a good condition and he does

520
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:43,260
it again then there's also our

521
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:45,420
publishing options you can say whether

522
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:47,130
it's published whether it should be

523
00:29:47,130 --> 00:29:49,110
promoted to the front page and what you

524
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:51,150
want i do you envision of it's just like

525
00:29:51,150 --> 00:29:55,520
in the plot presentation vm provisioning

526
00:29:55,520 --> 00:30:00,750
if you submit it should go to the front

527
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:14,070
page this say for example say for

528
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:16,350
example our new screen heroes which are

529
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:19,169
human readable I mean to enable a module

530
00:30:19,169 --> 00:30:20,970
for that so I go to site building

531
00:30:20,970 --> 00:30:23,520
modules here you see a list of all the

532
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:27,380
modules which are provided to I for I

533
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:29,490
normally if you have contributed modules

534
00:30:29,490 --> 00:30:34,669
still additional field sets below that

535
00:30:34,669 --> 00:30:37,710
adjusting your else we need fault module

536
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:38,659
so you can click

537
00:30:38,659 --> 00:30:43,369
enable it and I'd save configuration and

538
00:30:43,369 --> 00:30:46,119
that's all it takes to enable the module

539
00:30:46,119 --> 00:30:49,820
also integral 5hy wasn't available in

540
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:53,599
duple for our module versions we're now

541
00:30:53,599 --> 00:30:56,119
doing an pedasi checking and also virgin

542
00:30:56,119 --> 00:30:57,499
checking to see whether one of the

543
00:30:57,499 --> 00:31:01,869
modules is outdated an example would be

544
00:31:01,869 --> 00:31:06,639
venison checking you can see here to the

545
00:31:06,639 --> 00:31:09,139
it says that the common protocol is

546
00:31:09,139 --> 00:31:13,099
required by the porter module anyway I

547
00:31:13,099 --> 00:31:15,139
let me see if I need to enable any other

548
00:31:15,139 --> 00:31:16,970
module solve all enabled of a more

549
00:31:16,970 --> 00:31:19,190
natural slightly complex module allows

550
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:22,129
you to create complex forms the for

551
00:31:22,129 --> 00:31:24,139
tomorrow I will enable which allows you

552
00:31:24,139 --> 00:31:29,978
to create forums unable to search module

553
00:31:30,879 --> 00:31:34,570
I'll start with this

554
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:39,300
so they go back to the main page I

555
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:44,660
should not be able to think of edit I

556
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:47,400
should not be able to provide a clean

557
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:53,040
URL for disposed and so I be able to pop

558
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,930
mucho and Department of extends this

559
00:31:54,930 --> 00:31:58,260
form so there is a new field set and I

560
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:04,140
can use that to specify Bureau so by

561
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:09,780
submitted maybe I go to you you actually

562
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:13,880
see that URL now Akane hello awesome

563
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:16,830
this little part you can also remove you

564
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:20,250
think I'm a jerk htaccess file I don't

565
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:21,870
have that enable this configuration that

566
00:32:21,870 --> 00:32:24,090
normally it would look like this on a

567
00:32:24,090 --> 00:32:27,090
normal people say there is also much as

568
00:32:27,090 --> 00:32:30,030
which will also generate these spots for

569
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:32,250
you based on the title and things like

570
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:39,720
that I say I want to at least know stays

571
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,640
with me engage my site and I want to

572
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:44,010
dive into the navigation menu I quit

573
00:32:44,010 --> 00:32:50,070
again I edited it again I go to the menu

574
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:54,900
settings and here i need to provide a

575
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:56,850
title for the menu item and the

576
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:58,890
description is optional and done it

577
00:32:58,890 --> 00:33:01,380
essentially can attach pages to any

578
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:04,140
other patient system ok so you just have

579
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:06,540
to select one parent and then page will

580
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:11,030
appear as a child of travel and there is

581
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:14,700
by default look there are two navigation

582
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:17,670
menus bitty generate more the first one

583
00:33:17,670 --> 00:33:21,390
is this one this block you cannot menu

584
00:33:21,390 --> 00:33:24,810
items to that work the second menu we

585
00:33:24,810 --> 00:33:27,300
have by a bolt is this one which is

586
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:28,830
called in Cranberry links and you can

587
00:33:28,830 --> 00:33:31,320
also add making items to that which can

588
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:32,690
also create additional blood

589
00:33:32,690 --> 00:33:34,970
you want to our additional navigation

590
00:33:34,970 --> 00:33:37,910
schemes so say we want to add it to the

591
00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:40,400
bribery links i select primary links as

592
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:45,440
be very tight and submit and as you can

593
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:49,720
see the link now appears right there

594
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:57,140
okay we also add blocks which in the

595
00:33:57,140 --> 00:34:01,250
presentation was found portlets as you

596
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:03,590
can see i'm not sure it's really but you

597
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:05,540
have different areas so essentially get

598
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:08,870
feeds and it needs specifying the areas

599
00:34:08,870 --> 00:34:10,489
where you can place blocks okay so

600
00:34:10,489 --> 00:34:12,290
different teams can have different areas

601
00:34:12,290 --> 00:34:15,350
and this particular team as a header

602
00:34:15,350 --> 00:34:17,480
which you can see the top as a right

603
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:23,179
sidebar all stars of that tie bar an

604
00:34:23,179 --> 00:34:27,440
accountant in a military and a near it

605
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,210
provides a list of all the blocks for

606
00:34:29,210 --> 00:34:31,130
example the navigation block which is

607
00:34:31,130 --> 00:34:33,830
this menu here is now positioned on the

608
00:34:33,830 --> 00:34:35,870
left sidebar that I can easily move it

609
00:34:35,870 --> 00:34:40,639
to the side right sidebar and this James

610
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:43,179
floating

611
00:34:43,429 --> 00:34:47,520
you can also add works so either modules

612
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,260
can provide results or we can unblock

613
00:34:49,260 --> 00:35:00,060
yourselves another one this now the

614
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:03,690
block becomes available in da in the

615
00:35:03,690 --> 00:35:06,660
list I have to specify which regions

616
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:09,330
which region you go to say the left

617
00:35:09,330 --> 00:35:11,670
sidebar can also give it a weight and

618
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:13,800
the weight defines the order of the

619
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,900
block so the the blocks with the

620
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:18,210
isolation you'll sing lower and will

621
00:35:18,210 --> 00:35:22,260
become a bottom of the page if I say

622
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:28,110
this blog from become available this was

623
00:35:28,110 --> 00:35:32,160
blush and then there is also lots of

624
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:35,300
settings rage but which can configure

625
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:41,520
you can see that you can describe the

626
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,980
walk-in using multiple in performance

627
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:46,530
then either be filtered HTML you can

628
00:35:46,530 --> 00:35:48,990
even provide peach eco chicken company

629
00:35:48,990 --> 00:35:51,750
based snippets innings that actually

630
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:54,000
execute or things or that acts as the

631
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,850
database or that call vector or whatever

632
00:35:56,850 --> 00:36:02,130
you want to you can also specify Vokoun

633
00:36:02,130 --> 00:36:03,630
seen a block away from the book and

634
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:05,100
disable the block you can also specify

635
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:08,190
 roll it access to the block no

636
00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:10,970
anonymous users or authenticate users

637
00:36:10,970 --> 00:36:14,670
can also specify in using various ways

638
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:20,790
on which pages is what is what Shiva ok

639
00:36:20,790 --> 00:36:22,980
so that's how you have stories or pages

640
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:27,000
and how you have dogs something else

641
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,120
which might be interesting is a user

642
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:35,130
system there's a separate menu my over

643
00:36:35,130 --> 00:36:40,350
here because this page is he an overview

644
00:36:40,350 --> 00:36:41,740
while the user from

645
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:44,110
and google sites and thousands of users

646
00:36:44,110 --> 00:36:45,820
like like i mentioned the tupolev

647
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:49,600
answers like as over under 100,000 users

648
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:53,980
and weez controls who can easily mas

649
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:56,950
operate than drinking quickly to batch

650
00:36:56,950 --> 00:36:59,110
operations on all of them on this site

651
00:36:59,110 --> 00:37:01,750
is only one user which can also add

652
00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:05,590
users is interface or it can ask users

653
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:09,990
to create an account themself and then

654
00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:15,760
i'll go back to user management so i

655
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:18,010
mentioned be a troll so in this case by

656
00:37:18,010 --> 00:37:20,530
default is only two rows one row for the

657
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:22,240
enemies using a bun drove pretty

658
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:25,210
authenticated user okay but say also

659
00:37:25,210 --> 00:37:29,770
administrators in your site it simply

660
00:37:29,770 --> 00:37:35,170
had a role like this 0 you can see

661
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:38,470
there's a numeral available and for each

662
00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:42,070
of these goals editing permissions gives

663
00:37:42,070 --> 00:37:45,220
you a matrix like this so each of the

664
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:49,270
modules expose functionality which you

665
00:37:49,270 --> 00:37:51,880
can provide the people in that role

666
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:57,280
access to for example administers 911

667
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:00,310
these plugs should be able to access

668
00:38:00,310 --> 00:38:02,050
comments to be able to administer

669
00:38:02,050 --> 00:38:05,640
problems and so on

670
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:14,280
hey so if you prevent user management

671
00:38:16,290 --> 00:38:21,730
you go to the users can easily for

672
00:38:21,730 --> 00:38:25,720
example you select the user you can

673
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,730
choose to have a role to select the

674
00:38:27,730 --> 00:38:35,440
tutors like this as you can see music

675
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,930
based on is part of the administrator

676
00:38:37,930 --> 00:38:40,570
for if there's also different way to do

677
00:38:40,570 --> 00:38:43,570
that if you pet it feels increase at

678
00:38:43,570 --> 00:38:45,940
least you'll also have a list of the

679
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:56,830
available roseline like that same with a

680
00:38:56,830 --> 00:38:58,540
contact form really it's really easy to

681
00:38:58,540 --> 00:39:03,640
create a contact form but you do is you

682
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:09,820
add a category for example sales that

683
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:12,010
recipients which is just a list of email

684
00:39:12,010 --> 00:39:15,190
addresses can even provide an auto reply

685
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:24,120
hello receive her email yada yada yada

686
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:26,299
and

687
00:39:26,299 --> 00:39:33,589
myth and you conduct form create so so

688
00:39:33,589 --> 00:39:35,299
then all you need to do is add in

689
00:39:35,299 --> 00:39:37,489
contact forms of the main two then you

690
00:39:37,489 --> 00:39:44,900
go to menus and on this page is a list

691
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:47,029
of all the menus exposed by too much

692
00:39:47,029 --> 00:39:49,640
oxygen and choose to enable them or

693
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:53,689
unwell to happen to a maintenance or

694
00:39:53,689 --> 00:39:56,150
cool navigation for example the contact

695
00:39:56,150 --> 00:39:59,089
form is still the labels which you can

696
00:39:59,089 --> 00:40:02,989
enable it when you enable it again you

697
00:40:02,989 --> 00:40:06,349
have to select a parent so say you wanna

698
00:40:06,349 --> 00:40:09,140
add it to the primary links as well we

699
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:13,910
select that sweet hope you have a

700
00:40:13,910 --> 00:40:18,769
contact form duplicates the label to

701
00:40:18,769 --> 00:40:30,319
send ya message so what else can I show

702
00:40:30,319 --> 00:40:34,759
maybe feels actually yep okay so by

703
00:40:34,759 --> 00:40:37,069
default Drupal you see I did the same

704
00:40:37,069 --> 00:40:38,900
team for the front end as for the back

705
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:41,089
answers to the party also to choose

706
00:40:41,089 --> 00:40:43,489
different teams for the record that's

707
00:40:43,489 --> 00:40:45,730
something a lot of people

708
00:40:45,730 --> 00:40:47,410
before because they want a clean

709
00:40:47,410 --> 00:40:49,359
separation would be dependent on the

710
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:52,540
racket enough with this functionality

711
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:55,119
it's possible to do that maybe I should

712
00:40:55,119 --> 00:41:00,310
first show you the various speeds so you

713
00:41:00,310 --> 00:41:02,260
can download and install any number of

714
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:07,240
things one and then here here you can

715
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:11,020
select team by default garland is

716
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:14,170
enabled but it can also check enable for

717
00:41:14,170 --> 00:41:17,320
example Marvin complete do it like this

718
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:21,760
you say configuration and all of a

719
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:25,150
sudden your site looks different ok so

720
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:28,050
that's how it works

721
00:41:37,170 --> 00:41:41,970
so guess that provides a little bit of

722
00:41:41,970 --> 00:41:54,089
90 of 245 words what you can do it by

723
00:41:54,089 --> 00:41:55,619
using all these modules at all this

724
00:41:55,619 --> 00:41:57,089
functionality it's quite easy to

725
00:41:57,089 --> 00:42:00,329
configure Tripoli has essentially any

726
00:42:00,329 --> 00:42:03,119
kind of site one can be personified my

727
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:06,630
eyesight will be a news aggregator will

728
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:08,280
get corporate website which is fairly

729
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:10,319
steady it could be a discussion or

730
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:12,660
community websites or bringing anything

731
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:17,520
in between so I hope this relates back

732
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:21,450
to the original pilot presentation and

733
00:42:21,450 --> 00:42:23,970
then triple can be enhanced for many of

734
00:42:23,970 --> 00:42:26,579
the things you want to do with Drupal

735
00:42:26,579 --> 00:42:28,829
but again that it doesn't necessarily is

736
00:42:28,829 --> 00:42:30,390
the best answer to all of these problems

737
00:42:30,390 --> 00:42:35,760
and another question a lot of people

738
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:42,210
have is very fast so joko has a page

739
00:42:42,210 --> 00:42:44,099
caching mechanism which means we can

740
00:42:44,099 --> 00:42:47,190
generate page one story in a database or

741
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:49,319
file system and then when the base is

742
00:42:49,319 --> 00:42:52,410
requested again we just serve you the

743
00:42:52,410 --> 00:42:53,220
cash

744
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:55,430
we can do that under certain situations

745
00:42:55,430 --> 00:42:59,880
where we don't have to personalize the

746
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:02,580
page much when you enable page caching

747
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:05,430
total will be significant significantly

748
00:43:05,430 --> 00:43:09,060
faster than when it's not okay so with

749
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:11,940
page actually enabled on both machine

750
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:15,450
you easily are able to get 250 bad babe

751
00:43:15,450 --> 00:43:19,609
you're easily able to search 250

752
00:43:19,609 --> 00:43:22,530
requests per seconds we like too much

753
00:43:22,530 --> 00:43:25,800
shooting if you compare it with a norm

754
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:29,070
cash first you can see it's small bars

755
00:43:29,070 --> 00:43:33,540
on the on the left it's it's a lot

756
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:41,160
slower than this is a joke I a warning

757
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:44,700
up front so I once said I'm to compare

758
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:47,369
to home with Juma and that was to LA one

759
00:43:47,369 --> 00:43:51,270
point oh not the gym are 1.5 which is

760
00:43:51,270 --> 00:43:53,010
supposed to be a lot faster and big face

761
00:43:53,010 --> 00:43:55,740
caching enable Drupal turns out to be a

762
00:43:55,740 --> 00:43:58,650
for loops and Vassar so four times as

763
00:43:58,650 --> 00:44:02,910
fast as Ulla now if you take a cent five

764
00:44:02,910 --> 00:44:05,099
feet two thousand which in the state of

765
00:44:05,099 --> 00:44:08,730
yarns I'm machine which is known for its

766
00:44:08,730 --> 00:44:10,800
powder construction so it has little

767
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:16,589
Barbara just now if you use rupal

768
00:44:16,589 --> 00:44:19,320
overdue now you're able to save six

769
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:22,440
point thirty-three dollars a month in

770
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:25,790
power consumption which has a

771
00:44:25,790 --> 00:44:29,190
seventy five dollars a year so by using

772
00:44:29,190 --> 00:44:35,670
Drupal to help save the first so will it

773
00:44:35,670 --> 00:44:38,370
will it be fast yes really scale the

774
00:44:38,370 --> 00:44:40,920
answer is also yes scaling Drupal is

775
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:42,990
essentially scaled the lamb stock which

776
00:44:42,990 --> 00:44:45,180
is well understood means you have to

777
00:44:45,180 --> 00:44:47,040
scale each other layers in your psyche

778
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:51,060
of the scale of my cheerful scale mysql

779
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:53,970
is support and drupal app supports all

780
00:44:53,970 --> 00:45:00,240
of that so it will scale now if you want

781
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:01,950
to get involved in many ways to get

782
00:45:01,950 --> 00:45:04,080
involved we need people for all kinds of

783
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:07,470
things the best way to get involved is

784
00:45:07,470 --> 00:45:09,390
to just check out you pull the door we

785
00:45:09,390 --> 00:45:11,720
have issue trackers where you can shake

786
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:14,670
all the pending issues in the very fast

787
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:18,540
and things you want to help with we also

788
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:21,540
have groups dr. pollidori our interest

789
00:45:21,540 --> 00:45:24,540
groups in the regarding the order by

790
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:26,910
topic it's also good weight W to the

791
00:45:26,910 --> 00:45:28,470
community and get involved with the

792
00:45:28,470 --> 00:45:32,630
people that care about the specific

793
00:45:32,630 --> 00:45:36,090
topic we also if you are living in

794

Belgium we have drew papel de which is

795
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:42,480
the moment a Belgian a user group and we

796

in a while and we next month or in this

798
00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:51,360
month we're going to organize a small

799
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:54,900
workshop for people who want to learn

800
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:57,300
more about Drupal you do get into attend

801
00:45:57,300 --> 00:46:00,300
12 so check it out that Drupal of the

802
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:03,830
heat there's also google Summer of Code

803
00:46:03,830 --> 00:46:06,570
the last two years we've always veena

804
00:46:06,570 --> 00:46:08,460
involve eating Google

805
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:13,530
both which is a project by Google which

806
00:46:13,530 --> 00:46:17,160
is meant to sponsor students to work

807
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:20,700
during the summer and google just

808
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:21,990
announced that they're going to organize

809
00:46:21,990 --> 00:46:24,480
a third summer of boats and they're

810
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:27,690
looking for people to submit proposals

811
00:46:27,690 --> 00:46:30,869
for projects in order to be a banker 40

812
00:46:30,869 --> 00:46:33,810
students and we hope to get some

813
00:46:33,810 --> 00:46:37,950
students as well this year so if you

814
00:46:37,950 --> 00:46:40,859
have any questions feel free to ask for

815
00:46:40,859 --> 00:46:47,030
make sure to check our website question

816
00:46:47,030 --> 00:46:54,420
for a new installation so the question

817
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:57,060
is is a very reason to install 4.7

818
00:46:57,060 --> 00:47:02,520
instead of drupal pride um so Drupal 5

819
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:04,410
is a lot easier to use will also be

820
00:47:04,410 --> 00:47:09,089
faster typically than to perform so I

821
00:47:09,089 --> 00:47:11,070
would always recommend you go to provide

822
00:47:11,070 --> 00:47:14,849
accept because triple five is only one

823
00:47:14,849 --> 00:47:16,920
month old it means I'm not all of the

824
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:19,200
contributed modules are not really ugly

825
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:24,450
to work with triple five okay so before

826
00:47:24,450 --> 00:47:27,000
you start your website make sure if you

827
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,250
check on Drupal the door which modules

828
00:47:29,250 --> 00:47:35,119
are compliant with 205 and then make it

829
00:47:40,820 --> 00:47:45,780
yes so for the pedigree question is for

830
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:47,820
all the wondrous work on both my spell

831
00:47:47,820 --> 00:47:51,570
and phosphorus so the answer is

832
00:47:51,570 --> 00:47:54,270
unfortunately no a little cord will work

833
00:47:54,270 --> 00:47:58,710
for us because we rights NC is arrested

834
00:47:58,710 --> 00:48:02,280
so we we provide by we stick to their

835
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:05,570
standards but some martial maintainer

836
00:48:05,570 --> 00:48:10,080
sometimes use my spell specific snippets

837
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:13,500
or statements and when they do it the

838
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:24,240
manual work not really but it's

839
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:26,010
something which we should do a better

840
00:48:26,010 --> 00:48:28,260
job at communicating so it's not really

841
00:48:28,260 --> 00:48:30,570
clear clear from the website which

842
00:48:30,570 --> 00:48:33,180
modules will work with no specific time

843
00:48:33,180 --> 00:48:38,629
so we're only with my spot for example

844
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:41,720
question

845
00:48:43,410 --> 00:48:45,780
okay so the question is to every starty

846
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:48,599
sigue even though it's integrated

847
00:48:48,599 --> 00:48:51,859
important the answer to that question is

848
00:48:51,859 --> 00:48:55,859
because the cck such a big part I mean

849
00:48:55,859 --> 00:48:57,690
it's a lot of coke and it's a recession

850
00:48:57,690 --> 00:49:00,000
doing sort of a heart transplantation

851
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,329
they were taking a very powerful potent

852
00:49:03,329 --> 00:49:05,250
out of trouble and we're replacing it

853
00:49:05,250 --> 00:49:08,640
with an improved version the CC case and

854
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:10,140
we decided to do that in a number of

855
00:49:10,140 --> 00:49:13,700
steps and Google five become minutes

856
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:16,440
depending on how you come the first or a

857
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:19,440
second step forget the system k in court

858
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:22,770
so right now you're able to create your

859
00:49:22,770 --> 00:49:25,740
mountain bikes report which only have a

860
00:49:25,740 --> 00:49:29,940
title and a body okay I mean the next

861
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:33,170
version of liminal space will be able to

862
00:49:33,170 --> 00:49:35,520
have any complete since you came for

863
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:38,069
you'll also be able to add additional

864
00:49:38,069 --> 00:49:42,539
fields at least computer server right

865
00:49:42,539 --> 00:49:44,700
now if your profile you want to use a

866
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:47,039
cck is still need to install some

867
00:49:47,039 --> 00:49:49,200
additional modules which provide a

868
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:54,299
missing functionality question use on

869
00:49:54,299 --> 00:49:58,349
the content types right so is a question

870
00:49:58,349 --> 00:50:02,210
can I explain our access rights work

871
00:50:03,130 --> 00:50:06,980
access fries are defined by module as if

872
00:50:06,980 --> 00:50:09,080
you want to build a community site where

873
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:11,540
you provide access to specific content

874
00:50:11,540 --> 00:50:14,690
especially if user level ok right now

875
00:50:14,690 --> 00:50:19,369
Foo Fighters programmatic so three stone

876
00:50:19,369 --> 00:50:21,020
eggs here there is access to quench

877
00:50:21,020 --> 00:50:22,910
melody and there's access to governments

878
00:50:22,910 --> 00:50:24,440
and there's these are two separate

879
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:29,270
things both Maxis the functionality is

880
00:50:29,270 --> 00:50:32,680
what I showed you the usual information

881
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:35,540
access to content I didn't provide a

882
00:50:35,540 --> 00:50:38,930
table port but is he supports its

883
00:50:38,930 --> 00:50:42,320
fighting on report by the way to use it

884
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:44,180
is by installing an additional

885
00:50:44,180 --> 00:50:46,400
additional module one or more additional

886
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:49,130
modules and nerissa modules will be able

887
00:50:49,130 --> 00:50:52,400
to express various things like allow

888
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:55,490
people or a lot of people in this role

889
00:50:55,490 --> 00:51:00,500
to access content in this category or a

890
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:02,750
lot of people with this hope to access

891
00:51:02,750 --> 00:51:06,050
content of this time and because there

892
00:51:06,050 --> 00:51:07,400
is so many different workflows and

893
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:11,780
scenarios we haven't put a link or yet

894
00:51:11,780 --> 00:51:16,250
the board supports core supports

895
00:51:16,250 --> 00:51:18,470
everything which is bein for these

896
00:51:18,470 --> 00:51:21,140
modules to be little bit okay so there

897
00:51:21,140 --> 00:51:24,470
is there's just really what's important

898
00:51:24,470 --> 00:51:26,810
they're not exposed to a user interface

899
00:51:26,810 --> 00:51:28,580
the way to do is

900
00:51:28,580 --> 00:51:34,640
two possibilities I think there's not

901
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:37,270
content modules which allows you to

902
00:51:37,270 --> 00:51:41,420
configure access to government is very

903
00:51:41,420 --> 00:51:46,450
place depending on your situation your

904
00:51:47,980 --> 00:51:53,510
question yes the only providing may have

905
00:51:53,510 --> 00:51:57,620
syntax link to order history or like

906
00:51:57,620 --> 00:52:03,130
both days underlying data sorry you need

907
00:52:03,130 --> 00:52:07,280
any HTML already so in the question is

908
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:08,480
your module which allows you three

909
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:12,800
different first a big difference this is

910
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:16,780
my story and also if there's a syntax a

911
00:52:16,780 --> 00:52:20,210
wiki for example to create sections to

912
00:52:20,210 --> 00:52:26,240
them so for example the cck has a field

913
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:28,490
which is well known brand which allows

914
00:52:28,490 --> 00:52:30,950
you to link a different notes and then

915
00:52:30,950 --> 00:52:35,420
sorry make it look like one jeezum

916
00:52:35,420 --> 00:52:37,430
profits and then the answer to your

917
00:52:37,430 --> 00:52:42,020
other question is everything in true for

918
00:52:42,020 --> 00:52:43,550
all the content in Drupal is run through

919
00:52:43,550 --> 00:52:46,070
a number of filters with me one-on-one

920
00:52:46,070 --> 00:52:50,330
filters and we call a group of builders

921
00:52:50,330 --> 00:52:56,240
we called an input formats okay so I'll

922
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:58,540
show you

923
00:53:01,450 --> 00:53:03,849
so when your head is a peasant on the

924
00:53:03,849 --> 00:53:05,320
flight in this case the body there's

925
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:09,339
often an informant and filter it allows

926
00:53:09,339 --> 00:53:14,800
you to select different filters for

927
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:18,609
example it would be builder HTML and in

928
00:53:18,609 --> 00:53:22,000
this case it will replace web page

929
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,790
addresses and email addresses I make the

930
00:53:24,790 --> 00:53:28,660
links it will strip evoke HTML and it

931
00:53:28,660 --> 00:53:30,880
will do a line written paragraph text

932
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:36,070
okay and by by default encoders create /

933
00:53:36,070 --> 00:53:38,410
struts 2 modules you cannot work for

934
00:53:38,410 --> 00:53:42,849
your MOU attacks or install a filter

935
00:53:42,849 --> 00:53:45,430
which provides making functionality or

936
00:53:45,430 --> 00:53:48,430
which provides support for the encode or

937
00:53:48,430 --> 00:53:53,800
other markup languages there is also

938
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:58,390
much of it allows you to use letting you

939
00:53:58,390 --> 00:54:02,140
know describe mods and things like that

940
00:54:02,140 --> 00:54:07,890
so it's possible to learn from different

941
00:54:39,650 --> 00:54:48,089
these rebels are managed on a 30 degree

942
00:54:48,089 --> 00:54:52,279
side the other solution is pairing them

943
00:54:52,279 --> 00:54:56,009
besides which share database from our

944
00:54:56,009 --> 00:54:59,660
share certain days in a database table

945
00:54:59,660 --> 00:55:02,609
then if you for example shared user

946
00:55:02,609 --> 00:55:05,369
table and use both table to also use

947
00:55:05,369 --> 00:55:09,779
very efficient thanks to good fish will

948
00:55:09,779 --> 00:55:12,829
it's a technical and
