1
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:14,030
I've done base or boards and also vice

2
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:17,930
president of oversight products for

3
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:20,210
sleep one of loops and one laptop per

4
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:22,450
child

5
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:33,559
this is a picture of a school in rural

6
00:00:33,559 --> 00:00:35,930
middle of nowhere chamilia these fast

7
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:38,900
acceleration regulated because they go

8
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:42,860
honey go publicity years ago discovered

9
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:44,750
that the cost of black patch overly

10
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:46,760
expensive the cost of the fuel for

11
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:49,120
generators laptops a really expensive

12
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:52,910
kind of a opening there's nothing i'll

13
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:55,480
start with I want to try to reset

14
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:59,449
people's view of the world here the

15
00:00:59,449 --> 00:01:01,760
first problem is when the kids are given

16
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,670
laptops was persuading occurrences up

17
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:06,729
and using laptops in irrigated home

18
00:01:06,729 --> 00:01:09,110
because laptops are worth more than

19
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:13,210
houses that they were going home to once

20
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:17,090
once they have passed that point the

21
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:19,369
next problem the next realization of

22
00:01:19,369 --> 00:01:21,890
their to later was for most of these

23
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:24,380
kids this was the first time there was

24
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:27,670
any artificial length in their house

25
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:32,360
that's the bulk of the world most kids

26
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:35,359
go home at night two houses with no

27
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:38,710
electricity and no right

28
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:49,039
okay so this is sort of a cover in this

29
00:01:49,039 --> 00:01:51,649
talk in some sense this being a big

30
00:01:51,649 --> 00:01:55,549
audience Dustin error time to you why we

31
00:01:55,549 --> 00:01:56,929
designed the machine the way to get

32
00:01:56,929 --> 00:01:59,450
we've had the luxury which many people

33
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:02,240
typically have free software people will

34
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,219
not add of actually meeting of the

35
00:02:04,219 --> 00:02:06,709
designer on hardware from folks or

36
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:08,899
scratch this is allowed us to set of

37
00:02:08,899 --> 00:02:11,660
freedoms of design that typically don't

38
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:15,530
have and gives a lot of Savelle

39
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:17,510
directions is that that you normally

40
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:21,709
can't do in the microsoft ecology the

41
00:02:21,709 --> 00:02:26,390
beach not unless your Microsoft there's

42
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:28,760
realities about Harbor designed a lot of

43
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,829
people don't fully appreciated it's very

44
00:02:30,829 --> 00:02:33,230
different than the software there are

45
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:35,660
realities of what of what ingredients

46
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:37,280
you can actually get to make your

47
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,650
sausage and you can only make those much

48
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:41,840
sausages you can actually get get the

49
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,739
ingredients for it doesn't like software

50
00:02:45,739 --> 00:02:47,180
where you can always run off a few

51
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:49,459
million more copies it doesn't look that

52
00:02:49,459 --> 00:02:52,430
way some parts of the motherís be the

53
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:54,590
substitute that set those are called

54
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:57,139
second sources but other parts you can't

55
00:02:57,139 --> 00:02:59,180
are single serve suppliers and if they

56
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:01,370
stop being able to make your opponent

57
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:05,630
you're really hopeful if you make a lot

58
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:07,160
of sausage you can actually get some

59
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,830
custom ingredients made

60
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:10,690
coming up on how long an advanced you

61
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:14,770
start depends upon how unique and new

62
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:17,770
the green it can be so full of us some

63
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:19,890
Gillis Isles like a three-year lead time

64
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:22,630
you can build an ASIC it was Lola's here

65
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:24,220
for months if you know what you're doing

66
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:25,480
you actually build a couple of

67
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:28,840
applications to the i season the machine

68
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,570
the students that we are clear this is

69
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:35,580
the so all my best to machines of second

70
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:44,410
beta dust build we've done so in any

71
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:49,540
case what we're out to do is to is to

72
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:52,720
educate kids or helping educate

73
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,850
themselves that's what we're about we're

74
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:58,030
not about free software per se however

75
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:00,850
you will see how the two go hand in hand

76
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:06,970
hitter in this talk um there's something

77
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:09,580
worker one to one-and-a-half billion

78
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:12,250
children in the developing world this is

79
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:17,858
a lot of kids so if you do the math how

80
00:04:17,858 --> 00:04:19,810
many machines for years should we be

81
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:21,250
doing if we could build a machine that

82
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:27,070
last five years how many laptops were

83
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:29,200
built last year does anybody know in

84
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:32,500
this audience I'm it's like 65 million

85
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:35,500
17 donating something like that you can

86
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:38,200
see that that if we do this for real we

87
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,580
should end up building a lot more

88
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:43,169
laptops and everybody else put together

89
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:47,080
this is the reality of what the school

90
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,150
and the capital

91
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:52,650
Nigeria looks like okay this school

92
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:55,530
discussion it has electricity in one

93
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:59,280
room there's none there's no lights no

94
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,160
nothing in the regular classroom and

95
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,870
that's the capital city you go outside

96
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:05,700
of the governments of the Nigeria that

97
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:09,780
doesn't get better it gets worse another

98
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:14,659
picture of kids from from that school

99
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:17,880
another thing I want you to think about

100
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:21,360
is is again I had a breakfast or someone

101
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,880
this morning who had never focused on

102
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,640
the fact that most kids only get say

103
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:29,120
five or six years ago another education

104
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,700
so the people we are trying to serve the

105
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,230
kids were trying to serve are the young

106
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:38,100
kids not the middle stores not the high

107
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,860
scores which we have a primarily

108
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:43,020
catering we're trying to fundamentally

109
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:45,210
help kids who are learning to read and

110
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:47,040
getting your help they're very basic

111
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,260
education and in some parts of all

112
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:51,780
however what we consider what you

113
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:53,250
deserve a stage patients quite

114
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:56,430
interesting I was talking to Veblen Greg

115
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:59,520
Parkinson's and whether schools in very

116
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,010
northern Pakistan by the time those kids

117
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:04,530
leave fifth grade they have they have

118
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:08,900
learned five languages quite impressive

119
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:13,020
but yes any exclusive to you the way

120
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:16,950
we're going that's a risk by software

121
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:20,130
not risk computers in education from the

122
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:22,860
developing world is because quite well

123
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:26,510
that's an apple to see where there

124
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:30,200
badly injured a few months ago this is I

125
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:33,470
think from when gravity so parents about

126
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:36,020
me late 1960s or something like that so

127
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,120
this is not a fashion of hand the

128
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,560
difference is we're trying to do this is

129
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,330
scale because we believe that there are

130
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:44,030
network effects that they place when

131
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:48,200
every child has machine will call one

132
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,090
laptop per child for a very good reason

133
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:52,400
we don't believe that shearing machines

134
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,850
or computer labs are in fact a way for

135
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:59,170
kids to use them do we share our pencils

136
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:03,260
very hard to use it as it as a basic as

137
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:05,210
your book if you're trying to share it

138
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:06,920
sorry for two people read the same book

139
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:10,310
at the same time so we're really really

140
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:12,470
saying you say I'm not public office

141
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:17,690
basic premise of the project okay so

142
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:18,980
there's lots of interest from all over

143
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,960
the world we're likely to launch in the

144
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,420
country's reading your kind of a

145
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:26,090
Mississippi courtesy of the change of

146
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:28,640
government that always makes things much

147
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:32,000
more entertaining governments are not

148
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,590
necessarily say our premise is that kids

149
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:38,960
all over the world and this is true so

150
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,500
long as they get a decent nutrition or

151
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:45,140
justice break all over the world as they

152
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:51,500
are here so we think that if we can get

153
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,000
the shootings in the hands

154
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,280
every kid that this is a really

155
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,890
fundamental tool this was a huge set of

156
00:07:57,890 --> 00:08:00,530
challenges up first right Adam another

157
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:02,780
one of you yes we don't believe that

158
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:05,900
kids are just passive consumers up quote

159
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:09,350
content from the content providers of

160
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:11,900
the world we believe the kids are

161
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:14,360
creative those of you who have children

162
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,580
almost certainly your children keep

163
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:19,000
journals at least in their early years

164
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,470
as you may know we need right intern

165
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:23,600
intimately related and so writing in

166
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,720
journal is something that's that's from

167
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:31,160
my wife and daughter now in fifth or

168
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,809
sixth grade able to actually a great

169
00:08:32,809 --> 00:08:35,599
Englishmen were well which is quite

170
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:39,590
remarkable this is a program called Camp

171
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:42,229
hands under development this particular

172
00:08:42,229 --> 00:08:45,170
version isn't out yet but the intent is

173
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:48,970
who gets filled with those of our music

174
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:51,950
the other thing is we want kids to be

175
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:56,180
able to experiment okay this money is on

176
00:08:56,180 --> 00:09:00,770
the left we did this for demo of the

177
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:02,980
simple he fessed words at a conference

178
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:07,220
last native their butts that's a photos

179
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:10,790
on the end of a wooden spoon the photos

180
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:14,450
all possible in a dollar this allows you

181
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:18,100
to conduct music because you've been

182
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:21,500
detected what the lightest and figure

183
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:24,460
out what the rhythm that you want to get

184
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:27,589
just by connecting with the lightest so

185
00:09:27,589 --> 00:09:29,450
we want me great easy to plug things in

186
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:31,820
so one of the unique things about this

187
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:34,640
is that the the audio port can also be

188
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,490
used just for ECM you can make a you can

189
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:40,130
use it as a navy rather than just the

190
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:49,100
best audio the network is really

191
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:52,310
fundamental we want the kids to be able

192
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:54,260
to share what gets to be able to work

193
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,560
together if you watch their own children

194
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,780
with their friends you'll often see two

195
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:02,360
kids in front of a machine busily DG

196
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:05,120
each other about the particulars in

197
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:09,170
there they're playing with similarly we

198
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:10,460
want the teachers to be able to work

199
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:14,780
with the children so the network is

200
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:17,120
really fundamental however this again

201
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,460
brings a whole set of huge challenges

202
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:21,770
there is no infrastructure in many parts

203
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:23,750
of most parts of the world how do we get

204
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:28,690
the network out to the middle of nowhere

205
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:34,820
so there's um yeah so we need us just as

206
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:36,740
important the kids communicate with each

207
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:38,510
other as of the internet and we want

208
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:39,950
them to get at the Internet answer this

209
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:42,830
way so so the attend doesn't have to get

210
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:44,840
internet concretely build schools

211
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:47,090
depending on where you are there's

212
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:49,210
they're good or terrible conductivity

213
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:51,410
high line for example

214
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:52,970
two thousand schools they climb do it

215
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:55,550
connected alternate gospel I'm going to

216
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:57,230
hand code nigeria get a very good

217
00:10:57,230 --> 00:11:00,440
different answer are going to do is you

218
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,300
can actually build networks in your own

219
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:05,600
very cheaply if you know how and the

220
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,389
other observation is for a lot of things

221
00:11:08,389 --> 00:11:11,420
like cell phones bandwidth it isn't he

222
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:14,060
used it goes onto the floor so there's

223
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:15,500
interesting games you can play tonight

224
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:18,319
by governments twisting arms or second

225
00:11:18,319 --> 00:11:21,680
burgers to allow the hamlet that's not

226
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,689
being used for revving their pain come

227
00:11:23,689 --> 00:11:27,040
halsted tor tor internet connectivity

228
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:30,410
this is a something to know of nowhere

229
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:33,980
and i think it was pakistan that some

230
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:36,980
years ago so they have the network this

231
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:40,360
is going across the student water from

232
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:46,759
pakistan into kashmir these kind of

233
00:11:46,759 --> 00:11:48,769
radios are not very cheap he can build

234
00:11:48,769 --> 00:11:52,009
about 80 20 this is a picture taken of

235
00:11:52,009 --> 00:11:56,149
some of the hacking away and downtown

236
00:11:56,149 --> 00:11:59,449
athens it turns out making their own

237
00:11:59,449 --> 00:12:04,430
network out of a cheap components so

238
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:06,019
what we're getting to do out of all of

239
00:12:06,019 --> 00:12:09,290
this is actually ship of salt mesh

240
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:11,990
networking the individual computers are

241
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:14,430
able to forward packets on behalf

242
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:17,070
here by computers you also notice that

243
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:19,350
he actually have income is that stick-up

244
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:21,089
that makes a significant difference in

245
00:12:21,089 --> 00:12:25,640
the in the sensitivity of your radios

246
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:28,350
beach camera has been doing experiments

247
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:30,149
in the outback of Australia which is not

248
00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:33,060
as it as it ever gets so sweet wedding

249
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:34,830
screen of what you can do a data to a

250
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:37,230
lot of even without Direction antennas

251
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:39,870
when when he said line of sight he's out

252
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:42,180
and up to two I think it's nearly two

253
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:47,190
kilometres billy mays play I don't think

254
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:49,140
that would be the more realistic thing

255
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:51,660
of course is sort of 400 years and then

256
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:53,279
of course then you start thinking about

257
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:56,250
measures of mathematics with that get

258
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:59,100
interconnected by various point point

259
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:01,770
source of links and then you have to

260
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:04,260
back haul however you can back in the

261
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:07,740
internet so that's the kind of

262
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:11,490
architecture that we're working on I'll

263
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:13,410
talk a little bit more about to go about

264
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:15,390
how that's good and the hardware design

265
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:19,170
here I'm going to go into what are our

266
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:21,870
design trade-offs again this is not good

267
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:26,430
awake I come obviously we care about of

268
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:30,900
being safe and New York a nap you really

269
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:33,720
don't want to have a 3 kilogram laptop

270
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:38,279
my six-year-old be pretty light we also

271
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:39,779
have a feature that that would be

272
00:13:39,779 --> 00:13:42,779
smaller than usual because guess what

273
00:13:42,779 --> 00:13:46,650
kids are lots more than we are kids like

274
00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:52,560
things that look what likewise it has to

275
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:56,310
be low power there some people think oh

276
00:13:56,310 --> 00:14:00,420
we should ship all the laptops and board

277
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:02,459
you don't use anymore here the

278
00:14:02,459 --> 00:14:05,040
development world well as I demonstrated

279
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,899
before the numbers don't work because in

280
00:14:06,899 --> 00:14:09,000
terms of quantity and then you think

281
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,070
about the power plants required power

282
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:13,170
these things dimensional laptops are

283
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:16,649
often in suit when T 5 watts usually my

284
00:14:16,649 --> 00:14:19,980
pop says 25 megawatts is this wonderful

285
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:22,260
you really need to worry about inside

286
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:27,149
power gray scale so obviously we have to

287
00:14:27,149 --> 00:14:29,490
make you seem cheap we're going a bit

288
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:31,380
expensive we're going to be able to

289
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:34,589
build minute quantity so our big

290
00:14:34,589 --> 00:14:38,310
challenges our infrastructure having it

291
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:40,850
what kind of our public activity

292
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:43,649
obviously as Thailand is approaching to

293
00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:45,750
demonstrate political instability is

294
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:48,480
also a major challenge we have to worry

295
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,079
about physical environment kids don't

296
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:54,120
get on school buses in the developing

297
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:58,079
world at what what ishida survive a

298
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:03,870
trained on at least one close so we

299
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:05,970
worry about about Earth and you will

300
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:08,100
notice it has a rubber keyboard it isn't

301
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:12,209
isn't yes it's it isn't that the

302
00:15:12,209 --> 00:15:15,630
keyboard is what's the sense of that way

303
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:18,570
though that may be true it's that we

304
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:22,699
have to worry a lot about water and dust

305
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:26,720
conventional keyboard will not survive

306
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:32,339
so in any case there are other indirect

307
00:15:32,339 --> 00:15:35,130
costs would worry about which is if our

308
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:36,779
software is being bloated we have the

309
00:15:36,779 --> 00:15:41,200
problem you know I think

310
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:44,620
how big will the things together we need

311
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:48,300
to fight the sentence e hard in us I

312
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:50,590
believe people are beginning to take

313
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:53,140
this more seriously the not set out to

314
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:56,610
where the costco most in most cops yeah

315
00:15:56,610 --> 00:15:59,230
if you try to make a release building a

316
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:00,970
new sense of my pop it turns out the

317
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:02,800
sales and marketing to be your biggest

318
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,530
single expense so basically we have

319
00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:07,180
nicholas negroponte be traveling the

320
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:12,370
world as our as our president of

321
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:17,040
marketing whose high that had an amazing

322
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:20,290
forces major shall to say and then

323
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:21,910
there's a lot of expense that goes into

324
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:24,700
supporting a bloated software and

325
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:28,210
another major cross mysticism split we

326
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:30,550
 will display on your machines are

327
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:33,130
expensive and as you'll see they also

328
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:34,990
won't even work where we need to be able

329
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:40,910
to Alex light work the laptop today

330
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:46,100
is often gets only 20 or more watts

331
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:54,320
think one or two wats ok but so

332
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,550
something a little over a year ago we

333
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:59,580
got together and really know for our

334
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:01,740
first finger design review and

335
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:03,870
understood that building a machine which

336
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:05,459
look like this and then take a steady

337
00:17:05,459 --> 00:17:09,150
state power something of order 2 to 3

338
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:12,929
watts was not good enough and reason why

339
00:17:12,929 --> 00:17:15,809
is reality of the first point a small

340
00:17:15,809 --> 00:17:18,720
kid cannot generate enough power we want

341
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,329
to have we want to have a situation

342
00:17:21,329 --> 00:17:24,359
where the child can rely on power being

343
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:26,160
available by being able to generate

344
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,950
results with some sort of am going it

345
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:30,690
turns out that I kind of the new machine

346
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:33,150
is a bad idea but there are several men

347
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:37,890
are using these extra places we really

348
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,300
want the kids to spend most of their

349
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:42,000
time actually able to read and bring

350
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,030
them life so our both women were like

351
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:47,340
ten to one really is because the child

352
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:50,220
has to generate power we welcome to not

353
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:52,860
be spending most of their time very very

354
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:56,030
powerful machine that sort of thing

355
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:59,010
there's another observation we figured

356
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:02,100
out which was a mesh networking ansible

357
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:05,090
wireless beyond preferably all time

358
00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:07,980
that's interesting problem if the CPUs

359
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:10,770
on all the time and the CPUs taking a

360
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:13,980
couple wats the numbers don't add up

361
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:17,880
very well so and in particular is the

362
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:20,160
child's not confident but empower when

363
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,290
they need it the first thing we'll do be

364
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:23,389
amenable

365
00:18:23,389 --> 00:18:25,879
the features that they are will be the

366
00:18:25,879 --> 00:18:28,159
tribe were disabled why I will have

367
00:18:28,159 --> 00:18:34,489
power so we finally realized that most

368
00:18:34,489 --> 00:18:36,829
of the time we looked your lap up not

369
00:18:36,829 --> 00:18:39,829
much is going on the screen TV refreshed

370
00:18:39,829 --> 00:18:42,769
and we're forwarding packets and that's

371
00:18:42,769 --> 00:18:45,739
it what's the time your cpu's been done

372
00:18:45,739 --> 00:18:48,799
why is it on tell me again why does your

373
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:51,709
processor on why are the processors in

374
00:18:51,709 --> 00:18:54,619
the audience on that how many of you are

375
00:18:54,619 --> 00:18:56,089
actually using your machines it's

376
00:18:56,089 --> 00:19:01,570
instant I don't see anything sencilla y

377
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:04,879
yes the wireless isn't working she's

378
00:19:04,879 --> 00:19:07,839
actually an audience

379
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:13,669
so the sesame is better with mentioned

380
00:19:13,669 --> 00:19:15,409
so from our point of view we want to get

381
00:19:15,409 --> 00:19:18,259
cross her off as much as possible when

382
00:19:18,259 --> 00:19:22,129
should win there's a power bill and

383
00:19:22,129 --> 00:19:26,389
leave the wireless it work and possibly

384
00:19:26,389 --> 00:19:28,700
the swype obsolete be be reading

385
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:32,119
something so how do we solve this

386
00:19:32,119 --> 00:19:34,549
problem well there are two consuming

387
00:19:34,549 --> 00:19:37,129
solutions to this one of which one piece

388
00:19:37,129 --> 00:19:38,840
of it of books called the decomp chips

389
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:41,539
will be design which allows us to leave

390
00:19:41,539 --> 00:19:44,809
the display on the LCD on and turn off

391
00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:47,659
the processor work so we could have a

392
00:19:47,659 --> 00:19:50,690
screen on and turn off that Cindy ages

393
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:53,960
but even a whole hour cpu is resulting

394
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:58,820
something if you what that costs us I

395
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:01,099
know something I yourself out or

396
00:20:01,099 --> 00:20:02,809
something like that but i always had

397
00:20:02,809 --> 00:20:06,109
done was a small ranch if cuz of this

398
00:20:06,109 --> 00:20:10,279
flight we also made that a deliberate

399
00:20:10,279 --> 00:20:11,960
decision to use a wireless chip that

400
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:15,739
nobody ever got it made by marvel it's

401
00:20:15,739 --> 00:20:17,809
actually has an arm line processor in it

402
00:20:17,809 --> 00:20:20,929
and about a perturbative I go Graham so

403
00:20:20,929 --> 00:20:23,210
this able to forward packets even if the

404
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:27,470
CPU is off okay that's why we selected

405
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:29,919
Martell there is no other ship-like

406
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:32,919
market

407
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:37,789
so at the end of the day depending upon

408
00:20:37,789 --> 00:20:39,350
what you're doing these people be down

409
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:41,059
the sort of one half to one and a half

410
00:20:41,059 --> 00:20:45,169
blocks area depending upon what your

411
00:20:45,169 --> 00:20:47,990
ears in the screen or our processes so

412
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:49,070
we think would believe you what our

413
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:51,470
batteries you have pretty good pretty

414
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:53,690
long life this is a typical number

415
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:59,779
obviously obviously a piece of those

416
00:20:59,779 --> 00:21:02,240
topically wake up the machine if we want

417
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,580
machine to appear to be alive and then

418
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:06,080
we were suspending it right and left

419
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,059
we're gonna have to wake up a posture

420
00:21:08,059 --> 00:21:09,860
quickly it turns out the p.o does not

421
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:12,919
ideal piece about 25 milliseconds to to

422
00:21:12,919 --> 00:21:14,360
do the wake up but it takes about a

423
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,340
frame time together this way back from

424
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:20,120
the from the recon ship so I think will

425
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:23,059
be about 57 tmobile sides of the fence

426
00:21:23,059 --> 00:21:25,759
so this is just a good edge of human

427
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:28,279
perceptibility I guess measurements on

428
00:21:28,279 --> 00:21:31,909
ipad can tell and showed that from the

429
00:21:31,909 --> 00:21:35,899
time that it came out of reset to when

430
00:21:35,899 --> 00:21:39,620
linux was able to schedule processes

431
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:41,870
took about 10 milliseconds on a 200-acre

432
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:45,139
good swimmer when I asked the current

433
00:21:45,139 --> 00:21:46,639
community how long does it take to come

434
00:21:46,639 --> 00:21:51,500
out of suspend it was very fun trick

435
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:54,320
question for a bit better last year the

436
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,389
typical answer was in the two-second

437
00:21:56,389 --> 00:21:58,130
range reality is

438
00:21:58,130 --> 00:22:02,470
it should be measurable milliseconds

439
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:06,260
okay so there are other things will do

440
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:08,480
like driving down slowly whenever

441
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,460
possible this isn't particularly not

442
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:12,020
allows other people are doing a certain

443
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:15,290
thing obviously change the rated which

444
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:17,360
we update extreme dependent upon here

445
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:20,060
you're doing that the screen itself is

446
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:23,090
very novels we'll see talking about

447
00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:25,790
before we have we using your smart golf

448
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:28,550
kept sending work or details about it

449
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:33,610
were our health implementing on a

450
00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:38,480
standard and development pulido 211s so

451
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:43,880
it's it'll forward packets without the

452
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:46,310
process of convo with the screaming this

453
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:48,610
up right now the more serious life

454
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:52,060
that's what was wouldn't be in my suite

455
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:54,740
we show that it was technically possible

456
00:22:54,740 --> 00:23:02,720
to do by Bobby orphan mice ago the

457
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,400
others that care about Polynesian that

458
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,130
are really in a really serious way most

459
00:23:07,130 --> 00:23:09,320
notebooks are often taking 10 seconds to

460
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:11,270
wake up I want I want to wake up and

461
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:20,510
under so the are going to be other thing

462
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:22,990
I would say to worry about was tossed so

463
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:27,000
this is really mean much more like what

464
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,190
consumer electronics objection molded

465
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:32,700
plastic you read volume to afford to

466
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:37,620
make me the plastic injection pingas a

467
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:39,750
sensitive they're by far the cheapest

468
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:43,950
way to make that make a a thing if

469
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:45,870
you're building in hi Bonnie she can't

470
00:23:45,870 --> 00:23:48,720
afford do it less warming things up I

471
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,160
well do you know what you can make

472
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:53,880
product you must have our volume in

473
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:59,160
order to get prices down so we're off

474
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:01,110
also getting rid of most of the

475
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:04,200
distribution costs basically the air

476
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,910
what was happening as the countries will

477
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:07,830
be ordering directly from ponca which is

478
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:12,450
e buddy enroll her doesn't even ammonia

479
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:15,000
knows most laptops in the world are

480
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,160
actually built like a set of companies

481
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:20,520
you've never heard of quanta computer is

482
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:22,890
a martyr cell phone one out of every

483
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:25,620
three laptops in this room of almost any

484
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:28,470
manufacturer here today was made by

485
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:31,520
contest so we have the possibilities

486
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:34,050
it's really quite fun to see how about

487
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:40,010
operation works oops did one Budweiser

488
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:42,570
okay so they think the power we lay down

489
00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:46,260
on the 12 the 12 worst cases if you have

490
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:48,330
all three USB ports sucking as much

491
00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:50,430
power as possible the more difficult

492
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:54,330
things to be down in the oil angeles

493
00:24:54,330 --> 00:24:57,810
coalescence we're doing it's not a very

494
00:24:57,810 --> 00:25:00,750
fast processor I sort of what we all

495
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:01,850
have

496
00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:07,400
years ago it's a govt x2 we have hundred

497
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:15,350
twenty eight million gram thankfully so

498
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:18,169
that's not a problem so in fact most

499
00:25:18,169 --> 00:25:23,030
software just works there's a megabyte

500
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:28,160
of serial flash for the current moment

501
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:33,070
USB ports in SD card slot the wireless

502
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:37,190
audio is also Cameron machine and has

503
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:40,539
many of my kind of eli better man flash

504
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:43,549
using they would have some gfs to

505
00:25:43,549 --> 00:25:46,490
process that doesnae a compression so

506
00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:49,309
for difficult programs and data it has

507
00:25:49,309 --> 00:25:52,130
feels more like a sensitive output set

508
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:56,720
size we also have a new cut touchpad one

509
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,700
direction to ship this and I don't know

510
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:01,700
yet before school sided over over budget

511
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:05,090
at believe what have I don't know right

512
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:09,260
in fact the one here which I have either

513
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:12,950
being uses dimensional touchpad or the

514
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:16,820
library and use of silos forward me how

515
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:20,539
to write strangely ver speaking camera

516
00:26:20,539 --> 00:26:24,940
the kids ability pushers the scenery so

517
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:31,039
go election right ok so I'll going to

518
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:33,080
sleep a little bit about power systems

519
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:36,559
design this machine will take more or

520
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:38,720
less anything nominally between 12 volts

521
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,270
and 24 goals being plotted record-low

522
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:43,039
car battery this isn't like where you

523
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:47,830
need a company's you know bricks

524
00:26:48,050 --> 00:26:51,450
that reduces exactly 15 point 5 volts of

525
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:55,830
us guess what lithium-ion really likes

526
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:58,890
exactly the right voltage charge we know

527
00:26:58,890 --> 00:27:01,350
what happens within my heart goes wrong

528
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:06,600
these days demonstrated so we are not

529
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:11,010
busy lithium-ion our original intention

530
00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:13,140
of use nickel metal hydride we're also

531
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:14,940
going to be using another chemistry

532
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:16,620
that's just the kind available which is

533
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:22,010
not lithium-ion about another lithium

534
00:27:22,010 --> 00:27:24,750
battery chemistry that is similarly safe

535
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:27,270
and ecologically friendly lithium-ion

536
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:31,770
also ought to be recirculated we're kind

537
00:27:31,770 --> 00:27:34,190
of make we worry a lot about what the

538
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:38,610
lifetime use a notebook manufacturers

539
00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:40,830
these batteries as a profit Center and

540
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:43,110
so they're perfectly having hatton buy a

541
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:44,700
new battery every year because we've

542
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:46,380
researched it for your three or five

543
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:50,850
hundred times aren't they that's not

544
00:27:50,850 --> 00:27:54,000
adequate for us so we worry a lot about

545
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,610
making sure that there's is possible to

546
00:27:56,610 --> 00:27:58,230
church with a view many many times

547
00:27:58,230 --> 00:28:01,020
because again charger that we just have

548
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:04,640
the first samples with love back which

549
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:08,340
has a car battery charge 10 batteries at

550
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:12,740
once that sort of thing is also

551
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:18,000
but also the ultimate fallback for the

552
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,330
kids this is generators there's a crank

553
00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:23,790
being built it's also a pull cord device

554
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:26,880
looks very promising if if you made it

555
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:32,660
what robust that awesome Media Lab

556
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:36,540
former me do an eclipse sort of the

557
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:40,250
company thought the end cut to build

558
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:42,870
that's much more efficient than a crank

559
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:45,300
your kind of abuses the little muscles

560
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:49,320
in your arm pull cord get these your

561
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:58,050
shoulders like the display itself it is

562
00:28:58,050 --> 00:29:01,770
a new and novel display it costs maybe

563
00:29:01,770 --> 00:29:03,870
forty percent of what a panel of the

564
00:29:03,870 --> 00:29:06,810
size of normally lost most of the cost

565
00:29:06,810 --> 00:29:11,130
of an LCD does not be LCD most of the

566
00:29:11,130 --> 00:29:14,190
cost of what we have in front of you is

567
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:18,720
in fact in the three color filters in a

568
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,850
fluorescent light bulb which is high

569
00:29:20,850 --> 00:29:22,800
voltage and therefore requires an

570
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:26,580
inverter and that costs money and how to

571
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:29,910
drive electronics what's more a

572
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:32,790
dimensional display does not work a

573
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:36,450
bright sunlight and most many are most

574
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:38,850
kids in the developing world get caught

575
00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:42,810
summer all the time outdoors so we have

576
00:29:42,810 --> 00:29:44,370
to have a display that if we could

577
00:29:44,370 --> 00:29:47,400
actually use the brake assembly so

578
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,980
conventional flat panels even if we

579
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:53,220
could affordable which we can't don't

580
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:56,880
work Meredith Jepsen is our CTO has

581
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:00,380
invented a new form of LCD in color mode

582
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:03,960
it's backlit and we have a funny pattern

583
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:06,690
you see red green blue red green blue

584
00:30:06,690 --> 00:30:12,900
and so on in front of the race you'll

585
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:16,800
notice a 200 DPI it's flooding ok so

586
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:19,950
this thing is 1200 x 900 resolution so

587
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:21,570
we have a lot more pixels on the screen

588
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:24,210
the most most of the laptops in this

589
00:30:24,210 --> 00:30:26,400
room you want people to be able to read

590
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:30,750
books nicely that sort of thing in color

591
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:33,140
mode depending upon the ambient lighting

592
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:36,030
resolution is anywhere from about 800 x

593
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:38,430
600 if there's a Indian plate and

594
00:30:38,430 --> 00:30:41,070
remember in this situation you actually

595
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:43,050
still have intensity information

596
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:45,420
occurring in every pixel so the

597
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:48,210
effective resolution spatial resolution

598
00:30:48,210 --> 00:30:53,910
is not a simple there is a simple

599
00:30:53,910 --> 00:30:55,920
function where you say oh I Dishman I

600
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,480
had one per the visuals therefore it

601
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,940
works up to the following resolution so

602
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:02,520
as the ambient light goes up the color

603
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:04,680
saturation goes down with the effective

604
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:07,620
resolution of the slicing up this is a

605
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:10,410
complex situation however if you test

606
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:12,720
patterns in fully dark room with

607
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:15,570
backlight worst cases around

608
00:31:15,570 --> 00:31:20,190
revolution a lot of other environments

609
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:23,250
it effectively sin the higher the power

610
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:27,390
consumption is very low we do not use

611
00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:31,910
the fluorescent light bulbs really needs

612
00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:34,560
they are color match selling these but

613
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:36,630
we don't care that the color fidelity is

614
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:40,020
that and so we can make basically all of

615
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:42,960
the manufacturer all of what the LED

616
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:45,870
manufacturer does so concepts a dollar

617
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:47,640
or two for the strip of twirl of the

618
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:50,190
ladies we're also replaceable because

619
00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:52,440
part of the problem is in places like

620
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:55,770
Libya the lifetime mobility is at

621
00:31:55,770 --> 00:31:57,810
elevated temperature exciting to be

622
00:31:57,810 --> 00:31:59,850
something like three to five years they

623
00:31:59,850 --> 00:32:01,650
need your place once during the length

624
00:32:01,650 --> 00:32:03,870
of the machine and that's possible to do

625
00:32:03,870 --> 00:32:05,550
so you can actually replace that pesky

626
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:09,240
backlight it should fail so at worst

627
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:12,330
case this display consumes about one lot

628
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:15,690
of power okay most of your slaves in the

629
00:32:15,690 --> 00:32:17,880
audience here are taking between 56 and

630
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:22,820
eat lots of cover he and gray scale mode

631
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:28,020
at funny had 25 perks refresh this is

632
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:33,570
light-based 100 milliwatts okay so this

633
00:32:33,570 --> 00:32:35,250
is a fundamentally different flavor

634
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:42,120
display than you do as I've said part of

635
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,770
the trick of making our power but was he

636
00:32:43,770 --> 00:32:46,200
able to turn off the cpu obviously have

637
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,470
to the top of the

638
00:32:47,470 --> 00:32:51,330
dear and be refreshed but but not active

639
00:32:51,330 --> 00:32:53,799
so they're usually officially a joke

640
00:32:53,799 --> 00:32:56,640
between the CPU and a tfp fault t'yhana

641
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:59,500
we have an innovative memory and that

642
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:03,340
what we call the econ and it drives the

643
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:06,190
funny pics whole thing for us it also to

644
00:33:06,190 --> 00:33:09,400
do some program paid always saying that

645
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:13,450
sort of thing so this is part of how we

646
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:14,860
have to point where we can leave the

647
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:18,700
slam on it from the cpu off you suspend

648
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:24,700
to ram see so this is sort of the

649
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:26,789
difference between our boat normal maybe

650
00:33:26,789 --> 00:33:30,940
they have to be confident Avery the

651
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:33,429
other the other ASIC we build hasn't

652
00:33:33,429 --> 00:33:36,100
been called cafe this is called sliding

653
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:43,059
down a slippery slope the the Geo turns

654
00:33:43,059 --> 00:33:44,860
out have an aunt flashing forward which

655
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:49,030
shall we say sucks so we had to do

656
00:33:49,030 --> 00:33:52,240
something and once we have an old ship

657
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:57,390
to interface tune and ourselves we also

658
00:33:57,390 --> 00:34:03,330
the country's wanted to sanibel a flash

659
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:09,210
yes the whole thing just another kick

660
00:34:09,210 --> 00:34:13,530
you get the dope bill will display it is

661
00:34:13,530 --> 00:34:15,360
actually usable in sunlight and that

662
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:18,830
presents a picture of a real classroom

663
00:34:18,830 --> 00:34:26,179
on how in some way this shows

664
00:34:26,179 --> 00:34:30,300
conventional IBM thinkpad and bright

665
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:32,310
sunlight and how much you get see and

666
00:34:32,310 --> 00:34:41,940
there's a lightness to it ok so i'll

667
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:44,489
quickly run through what we did a lot of

668
00:34:44,489 --> 00:34:47,969
booze plus some more pictures I about

669
00:34:47,969 --> 00:34:50,909
memory or laptops and shopping and real

670
00:34:50,909 --> 00:34:54,060
from this is what production one looks

671
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:57,660
like who's this first machine built in

672
00:34:57,660 --> 00:35:00,360
november i found watching the global

673
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:04,470
second goal with four weeks ago machines

674
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:07,240
we went from a whole pile

675
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:11,190
the sea of different mechanical designs

676
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:16,660
side so a lot of mechanical improvements

677
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:19,480
to be in the next beat so he'll be

678
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:26,430
tested we worry a lot about safety

679
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:30,010
there's no hazardous substances in this

680
00:35:30,010 --> 00:35:31,750
we're trying to make something that

681
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:33,430
doesn't match our burgers or hedges

682
00:35:33,430 --> 00:35:36,369
series in case somebody falls onto it

683
00:35:36,369 --> 00:35:37,570
we're trying to make it as moisture

684
00:35:37,570 --> 00:35:40,360
investment group resistant we can that's

685
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:44,980
everything you a little bit like 51 road

686
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:48,210
and you have a sober

687
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:59,050
what the ultimate environmental

688
00:35:59,050 --> 00:36:00,990
difference between using conventional

689
00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:03,910
Xbox develop paper which actually is not

690
00:36:03,910 --> 00:36:06,670
great with her need training day versus

691
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:09,390
building electronics variation question

692
00:36:09,390 --> 00:36:12,609
we're having people look into this the

693
00:36:12,609 --> 00:36:16,530
environmental differences are also

694
00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:20,980
washes but environmentally is it's not

695
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:23,680
obvious okay I want to move on quickly

696
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:28,660
of software this is we care about open

697
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:30,339
source we want to give us and want the

698
00:36:30,339 --> 00:36:32,619
kids to be able our community and the

699
00:36:32,619 --> 00:36:39,540
teachers to be able to do so really

700
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:41,980
we're obviously worrying about supper

701
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:46,240
blood seriously we're wearing a lot

702
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,310
about system security because we're

703
00:36:48,310 --> 00:36:51,010
building a grill our ecosystem we hope

704
00:36:51,010 --> 00:36:52,510
the dull side with in learning machines

705
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:55,900
next year and that would be a very big

706
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:59,020
target the other problem is theft would

707
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:00,709
like to be able to

708
00:37:00,709 --> 00:37:04,379
way son opened up is called open

709
00:37:04,379 --> 00:37:07,139
firmware press release so we're using

710
00:37:07,139 --> 00:37:08,599
that rather than a conventional

711
00:37:08,599 --> 00:37:11,609
conventional bias we have news licenses

712
00:37:11,609 --> 00:37:18,029
bootloader for a while and open firmware

713
00:37:18,029 --> 00:37:21,929
without being a bear bed nothing is big

714
00:37:21,929 --> 00:37:23,639
enough that getting everything she went

715
00:37:23,639 --> 00:37:31,319
into one native we care a lot about

716
00:37:31,319 --> 00:37:33,569
having complete control or using Linux

717
00:37:33,569 --> 00:37:36,929
files and firmer for this this allows us

718
00:37:36,929 --> 00:37:39,769
completely fall over there was in bath

719
00:37:39,769 --> 00:37:42,869
and so that we aren't running through a

720
00:37:42,869 --> 00:37:45,089
CPI stuff which when I remembered with

721
00:37:45,089 --> 00:37:47,969
with tens of milliseconds even if the

722
00:37:47,969 --> 00:37:49,769
bias doesn't do either stupid things

723
00:37:49,769 --> 00:37:52,739
I've noticed biases that seem to want to

724
00:37:52,739 --> 00:37:54,689
sit there for ten ten seconds for

725
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:56,909
arbitrary reasons probably having to do

726
00:37:56,909 --> 00:37:59,189
with the worst case of some device out

727
00:37:59,189 --> 00:38:03,149
of some USB might like ever do we also

728
00:38:03,149 --> 00:38:05,009
have kids to be able to see how she's

729
00:38:05,009 --> 00:38:07,019
really work because the basic set of

730
00:38:07,019 --> 00:38:13,319
applications being worked on a user

731
00:38:13,319 --> 00:38:15,419
environment remember that our user

732
00:38:15,419 --> 00:38:18,029
interfaces have to design for adult

733
00:38:18,029 --> 00:38:22,019
developed country office workers not six

734
00:38:22,019 --> 00:38:23,729
or seven or eight year olds who are just

735
00:38:23,729 --> 00:38:24,150
learning

736
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:26,849
to read do you think this is a good

737
00:38:26,849 --> 00:38:30,210
match folks you think our conventional

738
00:38:30,210 --> 00:38:32,339
desktops with whether they're granola or

739
00:38:32,339 --> 00:38:35,490
eating ye or vista or Macintosh are good

740
00:38:35,490 --> 00:38:38,970
nationally on kids don't things up yeah

741
00:38:38,970 --> 00:38:42,390
we care about is an England

742
00:38:42,390 --> 00:38:44,700
collaboration between the kids and your

743
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:47,819
teachers in their luxurious way and the

744
00:38:47,819 --> 00:38:50,339
UI this this approach gaming stuff like

745
00:38:50,339 --> 00:38:53,789
kids there's concept of the zune

746
00:38:53,789 --> 00:38:55,799
interface where this is the local

747
00:38:55,799 --> 00:38:57,779
machine and you can see your buddies and

748
00:38:57,779 --> 00:39:01,039
then everybody who's on the local mash

749
00:39:01,039 --> 00:39:04,650
so we are bringing the facilities for

750
00:39:04,650 --> 00:39:06,390
collaboration making collaborative

751
00:39:06,390 --> 00:39:09,990
applications really very far forward and

752
00:39:09,990 --> 00:39:15,930
ey so again this is the different sort

753
00:39:15,930 --> 00:39:18,150
of modes and this is a come on up with a

754
00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:21,559
journalist being built right now

755
00:39:21,559 --> 00:39:24,299
security you in the upper right hand one

756
00:39:24,299 --> 00:39:26,940
you're seeing a bunch of sets of kids

757
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:29,069
working around common activities with

758
00:39:29,069 --> 00:39:34,260
other browser the weather computers if

759
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:36,809
your application is being slow on power

760
00:39:36,809 --> 00:39:39,089
hungry I'm afraid that you're out of

761
00:39:39,089 --> 00:39:42,270
luck we often have a lot of choices for

762
00:39:42,270 --> 00:39:44,039
anything the tool we obviously care

763
00:39:44,039 --> 00:39:47,579
about small and simple so any works very

764
00:39:47,579 --> 00:39:49,289
nice but it's too much for a

765
00:39:49,289 --> 00:39:51,410
seven-year-old it's great for my fault

766
00:39:51,410 --> 00:39:54,020
Jesus anywhere to preference cider

767
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:56,309
microsoft office a little bit office

768
00:39:56,309 --> 00:39:59,340
just because the Furcal girl that

769
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:00,840
seems that mean we're does just about

770
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:03,000
the right thing but for seven-year-olds

771
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,010
too much so the atageini word folks are

772
00:40:05,010 --> 00:40:06,690
building an ice and water before the

773
00:40:06,690 --> 00:40:10,260
aggregates great and again this also

774
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:12,090
applied by the best fact that you work

775
00:40:12,090 --> 00:40:15,630
these days those lots of ways we can I

776
00:40:15,630 --> 00:40:20,090
use help I have Jesus to give people who

777
00:40:20,090 --> 00:40:24,450
who are helping us I even have a couple

778
00:40:24,450 --> 00:40:29,580
I'll probably do the way on here we some

779
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:31,560
people whole question well why do you

780
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:35,370
use pinky que no tengo it turns out that

781
00:40:35,370 --> 00:40:37,860
has the best vocalization ability we

782
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:41,240
care about languages in a way that

783
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:50,629
language coverage in a way that is and

784
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,730
two things I really want the showmanship

785
00:40:56,730 --> 00:41:01,260
is I this wonderful logo for people who

786
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:04,410
work on blood it has an overweight cuts

787
00:41:04,410 --> 00:41:07,530
very sad with the international symbol

788
00:41:07,530 --> 00:41:11,010
of you know well so this is blood

789
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:13,470
Buster's who you going to call Holly we

790
00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:16,740
followed ourselves let's pipe load we

791
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:18,750
want to keep we want to keep pucks cos

792
00:41:18,750 --> 00:41:26,580
spelled slightly pudgy self well it was

793
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:30,140
it was files

794
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:36,369
it was in the presentations boss

795
00:41:36,369 --> 00:41:38,540
Macintoshes have their problems when I

796
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:48,400
say that connacher several problems okay

797
00:41:49,210 --> 00:41:54,200
we care a lot about Indian services we

798
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:56,930
think of servers as performance

799
00:41:56,930 --> 00:41:58,820
optimizations why the rather than being

800
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:01,400
necessary so for example our chat system

801
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:03,619
were worried about uses a jabber like

802
00:42:03,619 --> 00:42:07,070
we're a vertical but will work even when

803
00:42:07,070 --> 00:42:09,260
you don't have a surgery accessible if

804
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:10,790
we want kids who are in a village

805
00:42:10,790 --> 00:42:13,730
someplace away from the school be able

806
00:42:13,730 --> 00:42:16,880
to chat right so think about that sort

807
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:18,650
of thing you're doing things we really

808
00:42:18,650 --> 00:42:21,980
can't have system management in any

809
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:26,660
formal way courtesy of things like about

810
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:30,200
me and indie cast a lot of the annual

811
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:36,560
figures so we hope to or where we are

812
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:39,550
now is invisible per second build of

813
00:42:39,550 --> 00:42:42,260
machines will be a third goal later the

814
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:44,990
spring and which point we'll do much

815
00:42:44,990 --> 00:42:50,440
larger education prize and it looks like

816
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:53,630
end of July as when we should end up in

817
00:42:53,630 --> 00:42:59,480
high volume mass production and I once I

818
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:04,640
might have and by saying thank you this

819
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:08,660
project without war happens over many

820
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:13,930
years but not possible so thank you all

821
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:32,360
by that point for maybe one question I

822
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:43,600
don't know yes sir we're all birds here

823
00:43:47,230 --> 00:43:50,960
six bits per pixel the pixels are active

824
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:55,280
in kerrville if you do have to just get

825
00:43:55,280 --> 00:44:01,790
that in the mail a good question very

826
00:44:01,790 --> 00:44:07,910
impressive but guess the LCD is give you

827
00:44:07,910 --> 00:44:11,140
in reality about a 6-foot space feel

828
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:13,820
that's that's an answer to how that

829
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:19,810
works bharati yes sir

830
00:44:34,510 --> 00:44:37,400
well give me a lot of applications for

831
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:40,220
me but a impressionist is how do you do

832
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:42,980
localization if you're using mostly in

833
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:46,220
videos it's indeed case it the icons are

834
00:44:46,220 --> 00:44:48,740
not completely transferable culturally

835
00:44:48,740 --> 00:44:53,630
there are more so than then text is but

836
00:44:53,630 --> 00:44:56,150
yeah I think we have to but both

837
00:44:56,150 --> 00:44:59,960
different icons or for it understand

838
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:01,910
what the kids learn to read write you

839
00:45:01,910 --> 00:45:04,070
really do it's just that we have the kid

840
00:45:04,070 --> 00:45:05,990
the machine has to be usable black child

841
00:45:05,990 --> 00:45:08,329
who hasn't blue this in the process of

842
00:45:08,329 --> 00:45:12,849
learning all right one last question

843
00:45:12,849 --> 00:45:26,800
there the red red shirt yeah

844
00:45:26,910 --> 00:45:29,080
that should right now they break off

845
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:34,000
easily this is not a feature in the next

846
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,599
bill we're making the Berbers about Ben

847
00:45:36,599 --> 00:45:39,760
it'll Bend enough cushion to push them

848
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:43,000
around on there on the axis and that man

849
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,369
is a great question we these were not

850
00:45:45,369 --> 00:45:47,980
strong enough there were people who have

851
00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:49,780
been taking these machines and dropping

852
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:53,770
them on a marble floors yes on purpose

853
00:45:53,770 --> 00:45:56,830
we have several 100 machines have after

854
00:45:56,830 --> 00:45:58,060
they went after they went through

855
00:45:58,060 --> 00:46:00,160
thermal destiny and so on and so forth

856
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:03,070
ended up being tested and told the strep

857
00:46:03,070 --> 00:46:05,290
until destroyed so we can figure out

858
00:46:05,290 --> 00:46:08,260
what needed to be strengthened now a lot

859
00:46:08,260 --> 00:46:10,330
a few of the same things are in this

860
00:46:10,330 --> 00:46:12,250
version the next version of the

861
00:46:12,250 --> 00:46:14,530
supporting testing machines will have

862
00:46:14,530 --> 00:46:17,680
most of the results of of that were

863
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:20,740
making a more robust machine it takes a

864
00:46:20,740 --> 00:46:25,259
long time to modify injection molding

865
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:30,040
molds bleep I'm on those are quite long

866
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:34,359
within months the turn to PC boards much

867
00:46:34,359 --> 00:46:37,480
faster you knew she'd melt faster but

868
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:40,270
new plastic it's a sensitive at a

869
00:46:40,270 --> 00:46:42,810
certain time

870
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:46,800
I do all
