1
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:14,480
thanks very much I'm sorry this is the

2
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:18,560
low point of my jet white existence so

3
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,600
it's very possible I may fall asleep in

4
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,210
the middle of this tour I'm Melissa

5
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:25,369
angry Wharton's thought was at the same

6
00:00:25,369 --> 00:00:29,510
time yesterday i fell asleep is if i

7
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:31,250
fall asleep on stage somebody is gonna

8
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:34,330
give me again and we'll keep going oh

9
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:37,989
the other thing I'd like to say is

10
00:00:37,989 --> 00:00:41,120
please don't feel shy don't feel you

11
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,220
have to wait until any time at the end

12
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:47,690
to put your hand up and ask questions if

13
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:49,340
you see something you think it's

14
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:51,140
incorrect or you just want to ask a

15
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:55,130
question about anything please feel free

16
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:57,710
anytime to raise your hands and just you

17
00:00:57,710 --> 00:00:59,420
know has something and we keep a

18
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:01,730
question if you don't know Mike so that

19
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:04,239
the people of Mike will be able to hear

20
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:07,820
and also there are I think a couple of

21
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:10,310
people in this room who knows far more

22
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:12,590
about some of the internal parts of

23
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:15,799
Saturn that I do so at least I have one

24
00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:18,530
of them is in this room so if I get a

25
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:20,030
really difficult question that may after

26
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:22,070
hanging on to my colleague vocal and

27
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:24,350
decade here sat down on the front

28
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:27,619
cooking new parts of samba I started

29
00:01:27,619 --> 00:01:30,530
bein talking that it so by the time I

30
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:32,750
finish my talk he may check something in

31
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:36,200
the X my talk obsolete

32
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:40,820
but that's just the way it goes so I

33
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:42,979
like to think of Samba is incredibly

34
00:01:42,979 --> 00:01:47,030
ugly following a kitchen stool you have

35
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:49,039
no idea how long it took me to work out

36
00:01:49,039 --> 00:01:52,520
and extrude cylinders it open office and

37
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,799
create that graphic it's it's probably

38
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:56,299
the most amazing graphic in the

39
00:01:56,299 --> 00:02:00,140
conference I think anyway so the two

40
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:02,689
related Samba that I'm going to talk

41
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:05,000
about that really are what makes it an

42
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,939
interesting product and make it the

43
00:02:07,939 --> 00:02:10,340
interoperability glue that fits between

44
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:14,030
windows and unix are the basic Park

45
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:15,980
Service which to be honest is a bit that

46
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:18,290
I tend to spend most of my time on I

47
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:22,010
enjoy it's kind of like it's a bit like

48
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:23,690
we're working it and the faster this

49
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:25,940
mostly worked but it's kind of like

50
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:27,680
polishing that last piece of wood you

51
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,810
didn't get a perfect and you know as you

52
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:31,430
do it you realize you've chipped another

53
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:33,200
piece off and you have to read car parts

54
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,560
of it the other part is authentication

55
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,049
which is incredibly important and

56
00:02:39,049 --> 00:02:41,630
becoming more important as we look

57
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:43,549
toward to sign before and Active

58
00:02:43,549 --> 00:02:45,709
Directory domain authentication so I'll

59
00:02:45,709 --> 00:02:47,750
talk a little bit more about that but

60
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:50,989
also authentication covers the piece

61
00:02:50,989 --> 00:02:53,389
that we have rifles and a secret weapon

62
00:02:53,389 --> 00:02:57,370
which is what I'll answers to provide

63
00:02:57,370 --> 00:03:00,970
sign on environment in those networks

64
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:04,209
but linux and unix earth networks and

65
00:03:04,209 --> 00:03:07,780
the ugly part of the stool is the print

66
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:09,730
service which is a nightmare they are

67
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:13,480
killing again and we think we have

68
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,879
pretty much working and I'm good at

69
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:18,489
office little as possible about that but

70
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:19,750
unfortunately I do bear responsibility

71
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:22,450
for large parts of that occurs so if you

72
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:25,030
have any particular questions feel free

73
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:26,650
to stick your hand up and I'll pretend

74
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:33,099
I've forgotten so as I said Adam three

75
00:03:33,099 --> 00:03:34,930
names we've been going about 15 years or

76
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:37,870
so and as i'd like to say the file

77
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:39,519
services amusing for the additions to

78
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:40,690
the project because that's the bit I

79
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:44,530
were common it makes me feel good so

80
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:47,319
we're still working like it is amazing

81
00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:50,650
to discover that things that we thought

82
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:53,590
we understood in a new variants of

83
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:55,810
Windows about mr. tortoise a few new

84
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:58,900
things they've just become incredibly

85
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:01,269
interesting and you know we have to

86
00:04:01,269 --> 00:04:04,329
rewrite pieces of the code to get closer

87
00:04:04,329 --> 00:04:07,890
and closer to getting a tight windows

88
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:10,300
of course you can never quite get that

89
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:12,670
because you know users will change

90
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:16,390
things faster than you can get back but

91
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:18,850
it's it's amazing how much we still have

92
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:21,670
to learn really we recently discovered a

93
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:24,570
new metaphor in the windows Billy styles

94
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:27,730
that actually out and they come current

95
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:29,500
stable hood range but will be released

96
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,570
in the next release that were planning

97
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:35,470
to do in March um authentication so this

98
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:38,290
really started as something that we

99
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:40,900
needed to do as part of our service and

100
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:45,370
it was as simple as when windows and he

101
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:47,830
came out we had the ability to have

102
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:50,500
security ownership on files and we

103
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,870
wanted to be able to show the windows on

104
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:56,260
who owns this file and this led down a

105
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:58,360
rabbit hole that this led all the way

106
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,700
through windows NT to make service needs

107
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:01,840
of Active Directory domain

108
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,430
authentication believe it or not and

109
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:08,500
printing the only for printing was nice

110
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,840
and easy with basically copy a file to a

111
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:15,850
share or print you know PRM device so

112
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:17,770
you pop your file and descended onto the

113
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:21,400
spool and then a lot of started working

114
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,229
for Philip Parker who is very interested

115
00:05:23,229 --> 00:05:27,790
obviously in selling inc which is the

116
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:29,350
main business remember it's not a

117
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:31,360
British DC inc which is more expensive

118
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,310
than they were working so

119
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:39,720
he likes to say print more stuff so they

120
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,570
helped us work out how the important

121
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:44,760
print interface works that he's still

122
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:47,910
being used on call with those clients

123
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:51,090
and that was fun now we had a

124
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:54,390
preliminary implementation that was done

125
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:57,750
by Samuel T member in France Jean

126
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:00,600
Francois and we kind of said oh yeah

127
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,190
this would mean it'll take us about

128
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:04,500
three months to finish it about ten

129
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,020
person engineer years later we have

130
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:09,450
something that actions words but by now

131
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:13,610
coming to be a pile is also easy matter

132
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:20,970
so talking about car service we think we

133
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:23,520
understand most of what we see on the

134
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,430
wire in terms of our service there are a

135
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:28,790
few things that are a little mysterious

136
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:30,930
they're actually still a few flights

137
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:33,150
that are documented that we're kind of

138
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:37,710
interested in so for example some of the

139
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:41,370
things that you do be looking at

140
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:43,680
different ways to do this these these

141
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,810
are some of the weird windows isms one

142
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:47,730
of them is open by hinode essentially

143
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:52,110
the ability to do us at a far get 90 and

144
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:53,880
essentially opened by that rather by

145
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:57,270
path name we have support map I think

146
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:58,860
that's to do with the search service

147
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:01,470
that Windows users because i think the

148
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:03,390
indexes things by i knew that

149
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:05,330
we drive by that you doing research

150
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:07,380
that's something that we might get a

151
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:09,450
little more interested in the per file

152
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:12,600
encryption and compression we open up

153
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:16,650
the support that that's one of the

154
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:19,830
stranger areas might useful to do so

155
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:21,780
personally I think how you uniques

156
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:24,560
having its own per file encryption

157
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,410
compression compressed file system might

158
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:31,550
be a little more useful just presently

159
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:34,770
progress far back to the videos part the

160
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:37,830
separate data streams the file is very

161
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:41,490
interesting how many people know a third

162
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:45,030
of separate data streams before so not

163
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:46,980
so many so it was this very interesting

164
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:49,860
feature that when you open a file by a

165
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:53,220
name if you had come on the end of it

166
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:57,420
you can actually open or create a

167
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:00,030
separate file within a file so

168
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:02,340
essentially each file acts as though it

169
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:05,520
is a single level directory this was

170
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,550
actually used I pass I is curative a

171
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:10,590
point where somebody realized that if

172
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:12,360
you actually requested a little bit of

173
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:15,570
file and you prepended kollam kollam

174
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:17,850
dollar data on the end of it even if

175
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:19,680
family won't allow to access they were

176
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,220
Phil

177
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:22,710
name and the colon colon dollar data

178
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:25,230
confused the filter and I happy to open

179
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:27,210
it that's the name of the main data

180
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:31,350
sleepin in the file now I originally was

181
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:33,360
a big fan of doing separate data speeds

182
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,049
the fire until I saw an absolutely

183
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:39,530
terrifying paper on Windows security

184
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:43,950
which showed a virus hiding inside my

185
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:47,610
file dot txt in a stream that was called

186
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:51,420
kollam kollam virus exit and it turns

187
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:54,950
out that the windows shell interpreter

188
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:58,110
will actually execute something so long

189
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:00,420
as it has the name x e on the end of it

190
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:02,820
even if it's a stream name so there was

191
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,590
this utterly terrifying picture of the

192
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:06,960
windows task manager running showing the

193
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:11,940
mouth by file dot txt as a process which

194
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:13,170
is which is not something that most

195
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:15,360
people would immediately friday problem

196
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:22,200
though we currently i have flip-flopped

197
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,540
on that followed Ted chills advice on

198
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:26,520
having accepted data streams the father

199
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:30,450
is a really bad idea the good thing

200
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:32,820
about that is for a while we were

201
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,290
worried that we would have to support

202
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:35,880
that because windows was beginning to

203
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:39,660
use it but what what is turn out is that

204
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:41,850
because the Internet has become so much

205
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:44,040
more popular transferring files of the

206
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:46,410
Internet has a no way event curly

207
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:48,629
separate data stream to the file the use

208
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:51,870
of that has essentially be curtails will

209
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:56,220
begin ignore that so POSIX which is what

210
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:58,829
linux most implements with a few

211
00:09:58,829 --> 00:10:02,100
additions and a few missions is good

212
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:04,230
enough to actually mostly map most

213
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:07,620
windows file sharing semantics so

214
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:10,079
positive locks despite one horrible

215
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:12,689
feature are actually flexible enough to

216
00:10:12,689 --> 00:10:15,660
map windows locks onto the interesting

217
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:18,990
thing is you can't map positive lots

218
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:22,199
under windows locks we did yfs client

219
00:10:22,199 --> 00:10:24,899
O'Neill's really suck going against

220
00:10:24,899 --> 00:10:26,370
windows service because they have no

221
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:29,220
they have no way from the leaders api

222
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:32,600
automatic positive lock correctly and

223
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:36,089
also the popular unix is linux and

224
00:10:36,089 --> 00:10:39,000
freebsd are starting to add some of the

225
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,279
windows file metadata into the file

226
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,740
items which actually makes our life

227
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:46,329
somewhat easier in mapping the windows

228
00:10:46,329 --> 00:10:49,509
into POSIX and vice versa because the

229
00:10:49,509 --> 00:10:51,850
window I know is just chock-full of

230
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:59,259
stuff that normal of it oh so we have to

231
00:10:59,259 --> 00:11:02,199
live on on the leading edge of the linux

232
00:11:02,199 --> 00:11:05,129
and unix night standards which means i

233
00:11:05,129 --> 00:11:07,989
sometimes publish longer complete legal

234
00:11:07,989 --> 00:11:10,149
grounds about our evil and stupid the

235
00:11:10,149 --> 00:11:14,860
unix vendors are so apples was a classic

236
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:20,350
one i mean i think i actually meant to

237
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:22,360
help get ackles pausing cycles into the

238
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,429
linux kernel and this was by the simple

239
00:11:24,429 --> 00:11:26,679
expedient of there was a positive cycle

240
00:11:26,679 --> 00:11:28,929
patch with who stood by andreas Gromyko

241
00:11:28,929 --> 00:11:32,379
in general which would be your work by

242
00:11:32,379 --> 00:11:35,379
train and it's distributions but I

243
00:11:35,379 --> 00:11:37,689
really really wanted both exactly as in

244
00:11:37,689 --> 00:11:40,660
Santa across all the different biscuit

245
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:43,119
so eventually what i did was i coded or

246
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:46,389
pausing cycles in san ber to the solaris

247
00:11:46,389 --> 00:11:49,569
api and then publish the codon and

248
00:11:49,569 --> 00:11:51,610
started saying on any cyber risks oh

249
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:53,499
well if you want the real facts of the

250
00:11:53,499 --> 00:11:55,360
disciples you have to use Suarez and

251
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,029
within a few months strengthening of the

252
00:11:58,029 --> 00:12:00,369
the advil patch was through acceptance

253
00:12:00,369 --> 00:12:03,850
building its pillow so yeah sometimes

254
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:05,619
applicaton the term times the colonel

255
00:12:05,619 --> 00:12:07,779
people rulership application of making

256
00:12:07,779 --> 00:12:12,129
space currently work we're looking

257
00:12:12,129 --> 00:12:13,279
towards the

258
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:16,040
version for a tall model we can actually

259
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:19,939
a much closer match the windows no by

260
00:12:19,939 --> 00:12:22,790
saying much closer match I don't see an

261
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:26,209
exact match because how many people here

262
00:12:26,209 --> 00:12:28,790
actually read or play for the nfsv4 spec

263
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:32,990
or okay there's a leaf to protocol

264
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:35,240
leaves in the audience than mine anyway

265
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:39,319
so i'll just give you a quick idea of

266
00:12:39,319 --> 00:12:42,050
what ifs people did which was they

267
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:44,449
wanted to make NFS for windows friendly

268
00:12:44,449 --> 00:12:47,089
so they decided that they were going to

269
00:12:47,089 --> 00:12:49,819
adopt their acro model for windows but

270
00:12:49,819 --> 00:12:51,949
unfortunately what they did was they

271
00:12:51,949 --> 00:12:54,800
total published specification for

272
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,949
Microsoft as a model of how the apples

273
00:12:57,949 --> 00:12:59,660
were going to be done and they put that

274
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:01,930
into the fsa's for spec now

275
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:04,610
unfortunately for them it's very close

276
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:07,509
but it's not exactly what we know those

277
00:13:07,509 --> 00:13:11,899
so now we can have some three

278
00:13:11,899 --> 00:13:13,579
incompatible at the models we have

279
00:13:13,579 --> 00:13:15,889
windows locals we have potty tackles and

280
00:13:15,889 --> 00:13:16,350
they are

281
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:18,450
and SD for apples which you nearly made

282
00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:20,690
those apples but not not close enough

283
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:23,310
OER the wonderful thing about and asking

284
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:24,870
for a code is their brain causing

285
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:31,890
semantics right um so other things that

286
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:34,080
are being added all the birth time

287
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:38,310
filled in freebsd which our apple it is

288
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:40,320
using which is in a sense of the

289
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,450
timestamp of when the farm is created a

290
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:46,110
lot of people looking at the unix spat

291
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:49,020
medicaid CC time and they think that's

292
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:52,620
create time we need change time there's

293
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:54,300
no way you need to tell if i was

294
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,910
actually created so first time this is

295
00:13:56,910 --> 00:14:00,890
the is the method of doing that

296
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:04,020
sub-second far trans fats winners

297
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:07,110
actually can't timestamps in 100

298
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:12,360
nanosecond units from the year 16 / just

299
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:15,920
in case you have very old file

300
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:20,450
so sub-second fan file types types are

301
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:23,870
actually very useful and I mean one

302
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:26,570
second sucks so that's that's hard to

303
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:28,220
force of regularity so that's now

304
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:30,950
becoming at it and then we're at it what

305
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:32,600
am I firmly decided to support back

306
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:35,540
greatly another thing that we have that

307
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:39,589
we got into the next early and also into

308
00:14:39,589 --> 00:14:42,140
our X none of the only independent

309
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:45,230
practice of wasp are leasing which is

310
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:48,860
the ability for a kernel to guarantee to

311
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:51,100
a process that you are the only hope

312
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:53,750
that means you can do incredibly

313
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:56,630
aggressive cashing multiplier very

314
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:59,750
useful for benchmarks the network shows

315
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:01,580
that the cool thing about my back is

316
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:04,130
because it uses opportunistic locking

317
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:06,770
far leasing you can actually get a

318
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:08,779
throughput for your server that is

319
00:15:08,779 --> 00:15:10,940
faster than the physical capabilities

320
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:13,190
and ever lie between two it's what

321
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:14,870
you're actually measuring is primarily

322
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:20,240
bandwidth so nfsv4 also needs our

323
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,950
leasing so there's a bed much better

324
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:23,990
chance that some of the other kernels

325
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:26,360
that we need that we were going to start

326
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:30,760
walking in and exporting it to userspace

327
00:15:31,149 --> 00:15:34,490
of course the API is that the or tues

328
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:36,740
weds or certainly will be completely

329
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:39,440
different amounts every single units but

330
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,649
hey that's just unix vendors way of

331
00:15:42,649 --> 00:15:44,180
sitting in a circle bashing each other

332
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:47,000
of the head like what like the canal

333
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,740
lock my indicating this is good and

334
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:51,190
stuff my favorite don't about that is

335
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:54,860
because I as you may inquire birds that

336
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:56,480
are a veteran of the original motif

337
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,600
versus laws and the my favorite joke

338
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,050
about that is who won in the war between

339
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:04,490
proteins and flippin book the answer is

340
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:08,060
my cousin leaders abroad so I see the

341
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:10,160
same thing happening with Peggy more

342
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:15,140
than you that more things we usually are

343
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:18,200
I would define to face which one they

344
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,269
were in at those walls for yesterday

345
00:16:20,269 --> 00:16:23,300
someone has requested rather interesting

346
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:25,160
laying of the question he asked I notify

347
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,390
is a method of opening it directly

348
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:29,870
handle being notified on any file change

349
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:31,760
underneath either in Napa right true

350
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,829
interesting we have questioned the end

351
00:16:33,829 --> 00:16:35,089
that I asked was that we wanted

352
00:16:35,089 --> 00:16:38,209
hierarchical intimidation is exactly

353
00:16:38,209 --> 00:16:39,110
something that window

354
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:40,790
provides you can actually open a high

355
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:42,800
level directory and you will be notified

356
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,990
and have any changes in the complete

357
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:48,529
trailer beneath it so that's that's kind

358
00:16:48,529 --> 00:16:49,760
of interesting that at least some

359
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:53,600
application people want that so we both

360
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,660
identify there's no lips in a vest will

361
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:58,640
be notified with horrible and I using

362
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,860
identify which pocket just bought it

363
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:05,599
from time before we will were hoping

364
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:07,730
that this will be adopted a standard

365
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:09,740
across the other using senders but like

366
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:13,429
a sailor melbourne metro asynchronous

367
00:17:13,429 --> 00:17:16,010
i/o again something that have you talked

368
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:19,280
about we currently trying to put POSIX

369
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,169
fandoms as much as possible so a

370
00:17:21,169 --> 00:17:23,689
synchronous item code is actually built

371
00:17:23,689 --> 00:17:28,580
on top of the POSIX real time and if we

372
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:30,919
get a better version of that we may end

373
00:17:30,919 --> 00:17:32,690
up building a compatibility layer using

374
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:35,750
that instead it's really cool but

375
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:37,760
actually not going to use because

376
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:41,270
windows files would not pipeline reads

377
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:43,070
or writes they do a really wait for a

378
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:44,900
response to a right way for response

379
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:47,690
they would fill the pipe our SME find /

380
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:49,669
Lucio key code that we knew of that

381
00:17:49,669 --> 00:17:51,620
would have some correctly pipeline means

382
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:55,190
and right but when those little reports

383
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:56,750
come into the main list that windows

384
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,760
this that actually does the correct and

385
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,980
hating higher normal pipeline reason

386
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:03,559
right so that's what make things more

387
00:18:03,559 --> 00:18:07,890
and the other thing is the notification

388
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:11,070
mechanism for that both linux and

389
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:13,770
previously use an infant school event

390
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:16,170
the great thing about payment is it's

391
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:17,940
spelled exactly the same in both systems

392
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:19,740
about being back here Ventus it's

393
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:23,070
completely different other systems well

394
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:30,450
done when extenders brothers so what we

395
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:33,090
do about the piece of windows that just

396
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:35,670
doesn't matter very well Provost we

397
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:37,470
emulate them essentially i mean this is

398
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:39,870
this is the hard part assemble this is

399
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:42,330
that leads to be the fun part is having

400
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:45,059
that these some different windows

401
00:18:45,059 --> 00:18:48,679
semantics on your bosses bottle so we

402
00:18:48,679 --> 00:18:51,510
have to have commander profile log into

403
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:55,860
such a windows might expect we have to

404
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:57,870
have some very interesting delete and

405
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:01,800
close semantics that kind of fun so with

406
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,710
windows we posit when you delete a file

407
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:06,750
it just disappears from a directory

408
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,610
listing it's gone doesn't matter how

409
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:10,290
many of the people have it open it's

410
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:13,410
just this fear it will remain active

411
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:16,260
until the last open and us closer than

412
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:17,940
it will go away with windows the

413
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:19,230
semantics of really need to see

414
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:23,550
different in that you can open a file

415
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:26,190
multiple times and one of the openness

416
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:28,770
can set a flag that says please delete

417
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:31,470
this on corners and at that point no

418
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:33,540
other opens are allowed but the farm

419
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:36,059
remains in the directory listing until

420
00:19:36,059 --> 00:19:37,740
the last forever

421
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:43,380
deleted so I'm sorry yeah there's all

422
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:45,210
sorts of strange little restrictions

423
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:47,250
that are actually part of the underlying

424
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:48,900
windows so obvious common twist

425
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,790
economist at on it yeah there's also

426
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:52,170
some strange little restrictions

427
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:55,140
underneath that they're actually

428
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:57,179
exposing the windows implementation

429
00:19:57,179 --> 00:19:59,580
which is at the treatment of my

430
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:02,370
assertion that snd or six is windows for

431
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:05,850
a wire now the interesting thing about

432
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:08,370
Maggie's we used to ignore it but the

433
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:11,309
problem is applications depend on it I

434
00:20:11,309 --> 00:20:14,490
mean they do the biggest and most

435
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:16,800
wonderful sin ganas if Microsoft Office

436
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,620
which does weird stuff that nothing else

437
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:21,840
does Microsoft Excel is probably the

438
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:24,450
best test application for a faster I've

439
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:26,429
ever seen because it does things that

440
00:20:26,429 --> 00:20:28,559
nothing else you will never see anything

441
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:31,230
else do it's amazing so it's very

442
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:35,540
interesting application actually oh so

443
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:40,980
let's see an FSC 40 share modes which is

444
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:43,679
another windows ism which basically

445
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:44,429
about you

446
00:20:44,429 --> 00:20:46,799
open a file and say I don't want to let

447
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:48,480
anyone else up in this bottle while I

448
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,059
open I actually care about the he

449
00:20:51,059 --> 00:20:53,879
solutions if anyone's interested the

450
00:20:53,879 --> 00:20:56,190
original creator that the SMB protocol

451
00:20:56,190 --> 00:21:00,210
is an IBM 44 Barry Feigenbaum and at the

452
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:04,049
last for 16 conference we hundred tricks

453
00:21:04,049 --> 00:21:06,570
the the club after seven who works right

454
00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:09,299
here he actually got that he had to fly

455
00:21:09,299 --> 00:21:13,230
out and given to look at Walker says

456
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:15,779
protocol and I basically went ever said

457
00:21:15,779 --> 00:21:17,879
why did you do this to us it's the most

458
00:21:17,879 --> 00:21:19,830
horrible thing you could have done I

459
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:23,789
mean it turns out that seven when they

460
00:21:23,789 --> 00:21:29,340
were having smb2 das 10 they realized

461
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:32,220
that most applications weren't ring to

462
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:34,230
allow multiple followed by a network

463
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:37,710
file server and they already had in like

464
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:40,740
five important applications they would

465
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:42,809
behave in a networked environment so

466
00:21:42,809 --> 00:21:45,379
they had a chance to make sure that the

467
00:21:45,379 --> 00:21:48,919
clients could exclusively open a file

468
00:21:48,919 --> 00:21:51,230
because of this back i think it was like

469
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:54,600
1982 or 1983 everything else has

470
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:57,389
followed from that and of course the

471
00:21:57,389 --> 00:21:59,909
fact that you can deny other openers

472
00:21:59,909 --> 00:22:02,460
makes it is the main reason why

473
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:03,830
clustered

474
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:07,580
plus it is extremely difficult but we

475
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:09,260
actually simply solve our problem now or

476
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:10,820
treaters but I thought about that a

477
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:13,909
little while so the five certain code I

478
00:22:13,909 --> 00:22:16,130
probably saying acting is probably the

479
00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:18,320
best test the products and not I'm

480
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,809
greater value test food but we actually

481
00:22:20,809 --> 00:22:23,360
have a torture suites which is part

482
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,970
satyr for and the nice thing about that

483
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:28,779
sweet is it run on every single champion

484
00:22:28,779 --> 00:22:31,850
on sort of like 20 or 30 different

485
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:34,250
systems so if you break something you

486
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:36,620
find out what immediately and I could

487
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:38,480
say people occasionally actually be the

488
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:42,620
email that it's not often but so we move

489
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:44,630
ever sort of endless health statements

490
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:46,789
and burner I think we're broken on 13

491
00:22:46,789 --> 00:22:48,889
platform right now my thoughts that suck

492
00:22:48,889 --> 00:22:54,799
anyways so he is using use the fun stuff

493
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:57,529
that I'm doing a lot of work on at the

494
00:22:57,529 --> 00:23:03,860
moment sis is your future and so Israel

495
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:08,809
here doesn't have windows desktops at

496
00:23:08,809 --> 00:23:14,389
all in your organization yes virtual

497
00:23:14,389 --> 00:23:17,350
sheet campus leaders lives sorry okay I

498
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:28,840
got any work for you know I'm sorry oh

499
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:31,279
you're self-employed and you have no

500
00:23:31,279 --> 00:23:32,779
videos I yelling in your parents

501
00:23:32,779 --> 00:23:37,130
basement how many women when I was in my

502
00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:40,190
parents basement either anyway so

503
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:44,740
anybody has makers everybody has windows

504
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:47,870
you know any of these different windows

505
00:23:47,870 --> 00:23:50,240
of the foreseeable future and

506
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,370
essentially is a linux desktop is gonna

507
00:23:52,370 --> 00:23:55,970
thrive or go survive even or all the mac

508
00:23:55,970 --> 00:23:57,620
desktops they can't have to live in this

509
00:23:57,620 --> 00:24:00,380
world right so you're now if you support

510
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:02,299
guy and somebody says to you I want to

511
00:24:02,299 --> 00:24:04,220
put into the next desktop clients in our

512
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:06,470
but there were any different servers as

513
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:09,889
Windows lots of an fx the no I think

514
00:24:09,889 --> 00:24:11,059
would you throw out some more windows

515
00:24:11,059 --> 00:24:14,419
thank you very much so he certainly sits

516
00:24:14,419 --> 00:24:17,090
is the protocol SME sis is the protocol

517
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:19,130
that's going to go through this it just

518
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:22,880
is so it sad you're really the sanity

519
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:26,630
and the mac OS and Linux funds to make

520
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:28,700
this is seamless as possible in a

521
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:31,100
windows environment and also to fix

522
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:34,549
amber so the with linux and mac clients

523
00:24:34,549 --> 00:24:37,890
work a little better against Sanders

524
00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:39,570
they do against windows servers because

525
00:24:39,570 --> 00:24:42,150
hey we have both sides of the code we

526
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:48,180
can do some interesting things so let's

527
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:51,590
see iBM has full-time engineers d French

528
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:54,780
who's out working at connect with mrs.

529
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:56,580
weather sweatshirt the Frog couple weeks

530
00:24:56,580 --> 00:25:00,110
ago full-time working on on Linux 6

531
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:03,000
apple has a couple people working full

532
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,280
time they came out we all SAT together

533
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,500
there are actually now four different

534
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:09,420
client implementations one of them to

535
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:12,480
being a nerd talk about it but there are

536
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,910
four different sits quietly limitations

537
00:25:14,910 --> 00:25:17,840
that are starting to implement

538
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:20,670
extensions it's protocol that'll be

539
00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:23,610
defined to make lunatics unix it's a

540
00:25:23,610 --> 00:25:27,960
little easier so we all collaborate

541
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:30,750
basically and being on the servers and

542
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:33,450
projects question great especially how I

543
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:36,690
wish I forgive you because it's like are

544
00:25:36,690 --> 00:25:40,410
you an organism oh ok sorry just

545
00:25:40,410 --> 00:25:43,320
wondered because the students idealizes

546
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:47,629
seek you're really

547
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:54,840
say thank you because this is a really

548
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,130
really great conference anyway sorry

549
00:25:56,130 --> 00:25:58,700
back to your question

550
00:26:05,890 --> 00:26:09,559
so the comment is FS really sucks very

551
00:26:09,559 --> 00:26:11,059
very badly don't you think summer is

552
00:26:11,059 --> 00:26:17,210
better I agree in fact i gave a talk at

553
00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:19,580
the fs home from school sits to the

554
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:24,500
desktop or the death of NFS they thought

555
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:28,039
that was a great talk so yeah I mean the

556
00:26:28,039 --> 00:26:30,919
goal is to make sense the dominant

557
00:26:30,919 --> 00:26:33,110
that's not protocol easy going to

558
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:34,789
dominate on the back end when you've got

559
00:26:34,789 --> 00:26:37,179
big article i am talking to you know

560
00:26:37,179 --> 00:26:39,559
master almost certainly not that we ever

561
00:26:39,559 --> 00:26:41,690
has before hopefully some more

562
00:26:41,690 --> 00:26:44,360
intelligent protocol in pain maybe a su

563
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:46,789
knows but i think to the next door and

564
00:26:46,789 --> 00:26:49,370
many in small clusters of machines since

565
00:26:49,370 --> 00:26:51,440
really has won that war and will

566
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,659
continue to dominate so what we really

567
00:26:53,659 --> 00:26:55,490
need to do is to make it workers as well

568
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:58,309
as we have in our environments you

569
00:26:58,309 --> 00:27:00,620
missed this little builders variable so

570
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:02,750
background in unix expansions that i

571
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:04,100
like pronouncing them but i think the

572
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:07,549
body said that problems later so the

573
00:27:07,549 --> 00:27:09,980
goal from the units expansion consists

574
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:12,770
is essentially to modify it as little as

575
00:27:12,770 --> 00:27:16,070
possible right because we are okay right

576
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:19,130
I mean Microsoft is the company that's

577
00:27:19,130 --> 00:27:22,090
driving most of the changes he says but

578
00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:26,750
they did give away a small east of the

579
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:28,880
city space that was originally requested

580
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,250
by scope and I'm talking about the

581
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:33,530
original scope

582
00:27:33,530 --> 00:27:37,010
which was out there so the original

583
00:27:37,010 --> 00:27:39,170
scope designed some units extensions

584
00:27:39,170 --> 00:27:43,190
week HP also adopt and essentially the

585
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:45,050
early design of it was caddying new

586
00:27:45,050 --> 00:27:47,320
unique staff will get metadata the lead

587
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:51,110
so it's been since expanded so it will

588
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:53,600
do posix locking so there may see thing

589
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,070
about this is the thing that I'm really

590
00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:58,130
proud of is we can run all with with the

591
00:27:58,130 --> 00:28:00,620
current one external and a modern

592
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:03,800
version of saga we can roll all of the

593
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,900
current positive logging performance

594
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:09,470
tests and we possible another address is

595
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:12,410
a mcdouble notes that plug into one of

596
00:28:12,410 --> 00:28:15,470
these three to the ever done that so yes

597
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:17,090
we really all the positive locking

598
00:28:17,090 --> 00:28:20,720
completely correctly we also have an on

599
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,910
the wire method of getting and setting

600
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:26,240
of examples which is pretty important

601
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:29,030
mainly pure Linux environments we also

602
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:32,840
didn't expel extended attributes and one

603
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:34,220
of God's that connect from we sat down

604
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:37,760
this review been implemented pause

605
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,880
experience for open make their own link

606
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,520
the interesting things about designing

607
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:46,190
the Cystic tensions is working out how

608
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:49,460
posix calls interact with windows

609
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:51,169
equals when they leave at the same time

610
00:28:51,169 --> 00:28:53,600
and then the mat guys really screwed me

611
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,149
over by saying oh yeah because we have

612
00:28:56,149 --> 00:28:59,529
cocoa carbon and you know whatever it is

613
00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:03,679
cocoa puffs subsystems or whatever their

614
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:05,659
governing on that thing we were going to

615
00:29:05,659 --> 00:29:08,240
do windows schools and both examples on

616
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:12,200
the same page sometimes the same far so

617
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,630
that that made a little more interesting

618
00:29:13,630 --> 00:29:16,220
so once you've got code open running in

619
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:18,860
the best in the best form of our SES we

620
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:20,419
go away two little words down there

621
00:29:20,419 --> 00:29:23,090
right now what we did and at that point

622
00:29:23,090 --> 00:29:25,940
I'm hoping that we will have four fires

623
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:28,850
the three I can talk about our mac OS

624
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:34,929
and Linux and 8px has a search fund

625
00:29:34,929 --> 00:29:37,549
there's a former will coming out soon

626
00:29:37,549 --> 00:29:39,710
once those all support meetings

627
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:41,960
extensions why I'm hoping is that the

628
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:44,029
other two that centers which are

629
00:29:44,029 --> 00:29:47,330
basically EMC better stop implementing

630
00:29:47,330 --> 00:29:49,130
that on their server side I know that is

631
00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:50,580
interested

632
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:54,059
Nancy will know we will know it one is

633
00:29:54,059 --> 00:29:57,110
sort of longhorn server support section

634
00:29:57,110 --> 00:29:59,669
to attention from I'm not holding my

635
00:29:59,669 --> 00:30:06,120
breath oh so we drink and then I'm going

636
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:13,200
too slow so authentication so we started

637
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,090
off essentially just wanting to

638
00:30:15,090 --> 00:30:17,010
authenticate the user first my plain

639
00:30:17,010 --> 00:30:20,490
text and biggest you know windows

640
00:30:20,490 --> 00:30:22,649
originally when we first started windows

641
00:30:22,649 --> 00:30:24,450
really have any security was just a

642
00:30:24,450 --> 00:30:27,330
username log on update then you had

643
00:30:27,330 --> 00:30:30,960
shell or security we originally adopted

644
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,690
one hand challenge with some help from a

645
00:30:33,690 --> 00:30:35,850
friendly engineering in with Microsoft

646
00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:38,490
two children neighbors did the main

647
00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:40,260
controller the whole main control thing

648
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:42,090
just we didn't care we were interested

649
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:46,409
but what happened was windows NT came

650
00:30:46,409 --> 00:30:48,750
out and he had access control lists we

651
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:51,149
really wanted a different role it's you

652
00:30:51,149 --> 00:30:53,370
who do that deposit it's a better map to

653
00:30:53,370 --> 00:30:57,630
our POSIX model so we were able to give

654
00:30:57,630 --> 00:31:00,000
out access control lists but as soon as

655
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,549
we did that what we found was that the

656
00:31:02,549 --> 00:31:05,130
windows I'd started making but soon as

657
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:06,809
we said oh yeah we support later that

658
00:31:06,809 --> 00:31:08,730
cause there's so many more these are the

659
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:12,029
goals that we didn't understand so a lot

660
00:31:12,029 --> 00:31:16,049
of work with that over many years and we

661
00:31:16,049 --> 00:31:18,490
ended up with him

662
00:31:18,490 --> 00:31:21,350
BCA distributed computing environment

663
00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:23,810
remote procedure calls to implement this

664
00:31:23,810 --> 00:31:26,870
and once watching essentially once you

665
00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:28,850
solve that part of the problem you're

666
00:31:28,850 --> 00:31:31,100
like fifty or sixty percent of the way

667
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:33,200
to do in the full domain controller so

668
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:36,200
the floodwall why not finish it so

669
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:38,150
that's that was essentially what

670
00:31:38,150 --> 00:31:40,430
happened that's how family gave an empty

671
00:31:40,430 --> 00:31:41,900
for domain controller because anything

672
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:46,310
which is the father really now in most

673
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:48,770
enterprises at least in the US active

674
00:31:48,770 --> 00:31:50,780
directory is kind of taking over as an

675
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:54,350
authentication source so 73 really gets

676
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:57,230
deployed as a member server territory

677
00:31:57,230 --> 00:32:00,290
environment I thought about Santa for a

678
00:32:00,290 --> 00:32:02,720
little while so we mark how many people

679
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:07,100
here actually remind the rest of you so

680
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:11,150
you should be all right it's not easy

681
00:32:11,150 --> 00:32:13,970
for you to run win one right now if then

682
00:32:13,970 --> 00:32:16,730
does that pay that Sanders see all the

683
00:32:16,730 --> 00:32:18,470
badges of honor if you get sound of a

684
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:19,910
brand that on your forehead you say oh

685
00:32:19,910 --> 00:32:23,240
great it's just

686
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:25,340
the goal for samples i will give you a

687
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:27,740
great file server and then song come on

688
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:29,390
make some money by doing really really

689
00:32:29,390 --> 00:32:31,850
cool Billy administration tools but

690
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:35,000
fortunately nobody seemed to do that so

691
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,420
any of you people have so one bone is is

692
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:40,010
really the secret weapon December

693
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:42,880
whereby this is a single sign-on agent

694
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:47,870
it allows unix you I knees and dled

695
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:51,290
three mapped into Windows six the cool

696
00:32:51,290 --> 00:32:52,880
thing about the code that will be coming

697
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:55,070
out and as we tested a large-scale

698
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:58,010
production systems is that it will have

699
00:32:58,010 --> 00:33:00,110
a lot of Education so here's the cool

700
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:02,600
thing you can take a bit of love them so

701
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:05,300
you can take a linux laptop you can join

702
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:09,010
it to an active very free domain you can

703
00:33:09,010 --> 00:33:12,410
say shut down or hibernate close it poor

704
00:33:12,410 --> 00:33:15,679
up the network cable take it home bring

705
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:18,110
it up again on a mark on using your past

706
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:20,840
credentials and see the you and

707
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:23,300
everything works see the users also ever

708
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:27,110
or VPN in everything will just work you

709
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:28,730
go back to the office you plug in again

710
00:33:28,730 --> 00:33:30,650
in will refresh your Cobra spirituals

711
00:33:30,650 --> 00:33:34,240
for negatively now right now the the

712
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:38,000
only Linux that has this is the develop

713
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,480
Susan if decimal because that's where I

714
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:44,570
was when we developed it now hopefully

715
00:33:44,570 --> 00:33:46,820
it will be being added to a lot of the

716
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:50,179
other when it factors but it gives the

717
00:33:50,179 --> 00:33:53,210
complete single file that you will need

718
00:33:53,210 --> 00:33:54,640
for interoperability

719
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:57,250
is incredibly cool it does require a

720
00:33:57,250 --> 00:33:59,980
little bit set up so what I'm hoping is

721
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:02,350
that as it gets integrated into other

722
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:06,490
Linux vendors and hopefully i hopes of

723
00:34:06,490 --> 00:34:08,649
our you know not counting I hopefully

724
00:34:08,649 --> 00:34:11,770
get put into solaris in freebsd is that

725
00:34:11,770 --> 00:34:14,050
this will become a standard and will

726
00:34:14,050 --> 00:34:15,639
become essentially the single final

727
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:18,340
solution for unique service living in

728
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:21,340
windows networks there's some problems

729
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:24,639
maybe because closet sucks and the

730
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:28,510
problems are scalars so when it when one

731
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:32,409
I hope you've noticed but sometime

732
00:34:32,409 --> 00:34:35,560
around after windows 2008 all the

733
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:37,989
interfaces in windows for looking up a

734
00:34:37,989 --> 00:34:41,679
user or group stop being a drop-down

735
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:45,520
list the gorilla ket will still have

736
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,199
knowledge they still don't understand

737
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:49,780
the apple editor was recently added to

738
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:51,668
nautilus and what you want to add an

739
00:34:51,668 --> 00:34:53,530
entry to an apple you have to click on a

740
00:34:53,530 --> 00:34:56,320
drop down menu and it expected him to

741
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,600
show you every single possible national

742
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:02,320
poll oh great imagine that you're

743
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,510
running is some of the environments that

744
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:07,600
are different redox active directory is

745
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:11,800
deployed in global networks where you

746
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:15,910
have servers in you know canada us find

747
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:20,560
all the links between a nasty wet pieces

748
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:25,900
of string the girl so oh and you have

749
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:29,950
users that's not in capital groups so

750
00:35:29,950 --> 00:35:32,170
now tell me how the drop-down interface

751
00:35:32,170 --> 00:35:34,840
but I've an apple oh wait 30 minutes

752
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,460
while I try and contact every domain

753
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:38,950
controller in the entire world this is

754
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:41,290
not scalable solution it's not going to

755
00:35:41,290 --> 00:35:45,160
work Windows has searchable interfaces

756
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:47,830
for all of these things you bring up an

757
00:35:47,830 --> 00:35:49,750
athletic event windows now you say I

758
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:51,760
want to how to use it it says okay

759
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:55,140
here's a search box search for that user

760
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:57,850
and then he will actually do efficient

761
00:35:57,850 --> 00:36:00,910
logo the problem with our environments

762
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:02,770
the Linux and UNIX environments is that

763
00:36:02,770 --> 00:36:04,630
we only have the positive in effect the

764
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:06,970
positive phase is done and bold and

765
00:36:06,970 --> 00:36:10,180
inspect have cheap local organs that is

766
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:13,450
no longer the case so we have to do

767
00:36:13,450 --> 00:36:15,730
things like the only interface we

768
00:36:15,730 --> 00:36:18,220
liberated users for certain users is to

769
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:21,340
search through the entire list the get

770
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:23,470
gr map for which returns a group

771
00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:25,360
information one of the things it returns

772
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:28,390
to you is a list tech space the list of

773
00:36:28,390 --> 00:36:31,510
everything user in my group mostly many

774
00:36:31,510 --> 00:36:34,060
many are caught each don't care you only

775
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:37,060
want to know what's the good idea so

776
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:38,980
it's just incredibly efficient and

777
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:39,970
babbling design

778
00:36:39,970 --> 00:36:42,070
big low levels this will have to be

779
00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:45,430
fixed I don't know how many success it

780
00:36:45,430 --> 00:36:47,800
will probably be some collaboration with

781
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:50,170
a lot of the unique senders Apple some

782
00:36:50,170 --> 00:36:54,250
ill offenders and the DMC people but we

783
00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:56,320
have had a better interface units

784
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:59,040
because otherwise were kind of rope oh

785
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,150
the other thing is windows or else

786
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:02,890
groups within groups which is very

787
00:37:02,890 --> 00:37:06,310
important for very large networks so we

788
00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:07,840
actually have a feature in my mind we're

789
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,700
essentially will unroll that into the

790
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:13,840
focus of users for but it's it it's a

791
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:16,330
little public so we become an email

792
00:37:16,330 --> 00:37:21,730
interface so what being a DC is is a

793
00:37:21,730 --> 00:37:25,119
change a great deal since Windows NT for

794
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:27,430
dinner and active directory is really

795
00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:30,609
now not mentally and that essentially is

796
00:37:30,609 --> 00:37:33,340
the global cyber for is the primary

797
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:34,900
thing to be active directory to make

798
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:39,700
control but it's very very hard so you

799
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:41,440
know why is running at the very few so

800
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:44,530
difficult right amigo well it's not just

801
00:37:44,530 --> 00:37:47,530
one protocol if anti-fairy was simply

802
00:37:47,530 --> 00:37:49,780
display over it young buyer would be

803
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:52,990
patched or vanellope really finish the

804
00:37:52,990 --> 00:37:56,190
problem is when windows funds stop

805
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:58,630
talking to acting directly they say i

806
00:37:58,630 --> 00:38:00,670
need an active directory domain they

807
00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:02,680
will start doing their work if you want

808
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:06,190
or they will do a call to something

809
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:07,160
called connecting your show

810
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:11,270
which we have implemented then once they

811
00:38:11,270 --> 00:38:13,850
get information from that they'll do dns

812
00:38:13,850 --> 00:38:15,500
periods then when they get information

813
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:17,870
back from that they'll start with Curtis

814
00:38:17,870 --> 00:38:20,090
who is tickets they get back from that

815
00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:22,700
they will pass into the DC of the

816
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:25,480
seagull tunnel of an SMP that

817
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:27,560
information they get back from that they

818
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:30,380
will then use to do a straight DC or a

819
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:32,900
tcp call the information that comes back

820
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:34,550
from that then starts getting fed to

821
00:38:34,550 --> 00:38:37,400
ldap queries and for factories or DNS

822
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,920
you get the idea any one of those steps

823
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:43,060
fail hopefully folks and appliances are

824
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:45,350
denied controller this is not only what

825
00:38:45,350 --> 00:38:49,190
the director you make you need active

826
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:51,760
directory enqs model and the schema

827
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:54,380
essentially you have all these different

828
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:56,300
components they all have to talk will

829
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:58,190
come about that store they all have to

830
00:38:58,190 --> 00:39:00,410
be completely integrated with each other

831
00:39:00,410 --> 00:39:02,000
you come in you change the password

832
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,680
viral out you have to see their own

833
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:06,080
perverse you come in and set a cam

834
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:10,220
restriction by a DC RPC create are now

835
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:12,620
that you have to see anything has to be

836
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:15,170
seamless because that's the way we those

837
00:39:15,170 --> 00:39:19,370
types expected so all the components on

838
00:39:19,370 --> 00:39:22,010
the previous slide they all exist in the

839
00:39:22,010 --> 00:39:25,790
visa logo I mean pieces of them are

840
00:39:25,790 --> 00:39:29,619
everywhere I think the DC RPG code is

841
00:39:29,619 --> 00:39:32,710
all out there but they're not integrated

842
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:34,690
and integrating them together and making

843
00:39:34,690 --> 00:39:36,369
a little book like that see what soul is

844
00:39:36,369 --> 00:39:39,160
a very hard job so one of the things

845
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:42,390
that sound before is doing is that

846
00:39:42,390 --> 00:39:46,809
they're trying to work out what how the

847
00:39:46,809 --> 00:39:48,640
integration has to work how come

848
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:50,920
builders have to get together now one of

849
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:53,319
the ways that that's being done is by

850
00:39:53,319 --> 00:39:57,279
writing and replacing those honkers so

851
00:39:57,279 --> 00:40:00,430
the thing that day hi go go into the

852
00:40:00,430 --> 00:40:03,609
tree the ldap server is actually nucleus

853
00:40:03,609 --> 00:40:07,480
are not based on an elbow I'm wasn't my

854
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:12,279
decision that's not what my I am I'm not

855
00:40:12,279 --> 00:40:13,869
too keen on a decision I think in the

856
00:40:13,869 --> 00:40:19,029
long run we will have to start using the

857
00:40:19,029 --> 00:40:20,470
start sharing code will start using

858
00:40:20,470 --> 00:40:22,240
other people's projects but i'll talk

859
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:25,390
about that all over the DC RPC phil is

860
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:27,519
very clean very nice it's actually much

861
00:40:27,519 --> 00:40:31,749
nicer than the DC artist by the open so

862
00:40:31,749 --> 00:40:33,999
I think we'll end up using a DS the RTC

863
00:40:33,999 --> 00:40:37,029
go for that so the novel is that

864
00:40:37,029 --> 00:40:39,069
eventually what we'll have is will have

865
00:40:39,069 --> 00:40:40,660
a center for up the territory main

866
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:43,180
control right because the final princes

867
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:45,309
are being worked on so much there with

868
00:40:45,309 --> 00:40:47,769
sanitary member service and then

869
00:40:47,769 --> 00:40:49,839
eventually we'll be able to migrate

870
00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:53,270
slowly forward so it reduces a big

871
00:40:53,270 --> 00:40:55,490
fantasy right here's number 14

872
00:40:55,490 --> 00:40:58,130
everything making unit wrong all wrong

873
00:40:58,130 --> 00:41:01,610
this way allows us to say okay we're

874
00:41:01,610 --> 00:41:02,780
going to have an active directory domain

875
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:04,850
controllers sander for but you can leave

876
00:41:04,850 --> 00:41:06,920
all your members in place you know act

877
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:14,780
in the same way so basically the problem

878
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:18,590
printing thank God cups as one that the

879
00:41:18,590 --> 00:41:21,410
printing API have dominated all of the

880
00:41:21,410 --> 00:41:23,330
users which is correct because at least

881
00:41:23,330 --> 00:41:25,100
because of one target that we have to

882
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:27,650
write so printing these days is

883
00:41:27,650 --> 00:41:30,590
essentially just translating the windows

884
00:41:30,590 --> 00:41:33,050
the primitives intercourse course which

885
00:41:33,050 --> 00:41:36,830
is a lot easier in myself so the current

886
00:41:36,830 --> 00:41:38,720
windows printing is built on an

887
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:43,010
incredibly baroque set of DC RPC calls I

888
00:41:43,010 --> 00:41:46,070
have a separate presentation

889
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:50,600
why critics sucks so I'm not going to

890
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:52,670
that too deeply the interesting thing

891
00:41:52,670 --> 00:41:56,240
about the indie winners the printing is

892
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:59,600
that it actually is tired greatly to the

893
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:02,480
registry so what this means is you need

894
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:05,360
to have a Windows registry on Sacre we

895
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:07,570
can make a comment on the road Oh

896
00:42:07,570 --> 00:42:12,230
finally stopped again memory oh yeah

897
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:14,480
this is the solutions with some issues

898
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:19,610
with printing this is one of the reasons

899
00:42:19,610 --> 00:42:22,760
why Windows NT on alternate architected

900
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:25,120
like alpha and Power PC never made it

901
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:28,460
because the printer from you you think

902
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:30,230
the windows you know display driver

903
00:42:30,230 --> 00:42:32,270
people about the windows printer driver

904
00:42:32,270 --> 00:42:34,820
people are some of the worst killed in

905
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:37,970
existence it will do things like it will

906
00:42:37,970 --> 00:42:42,080
set something via a printing RPC call

907
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:44,690
and then expect to really out of the

908
00:42:44,690 --> 00:42:46,220
registry and the two things have to

909
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:48,410
match so this is this is what led to the

910
00:42:48,410 --> 00:42:50,050
creation of the sample registration

911
00:42:50,050 --> 00:42:54,050
really mostly a copious works the other

912
00:42:54,050 --> 00:42:56,450
thing that is a difficulty is what's

913
00:42:56,450 --> 00:42:59,150
called server-side rendering where a

914
00:42:59,150 --> 00:43:00,549
client center

915
00:43:00,549 --> 00:43:03,160
hansal Mehta file format file over to

916
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:05,679
the server access to the server here you

917
00:43:05,679 --> 00:43:08,769
render this form we will write worried

918
00:43:08,769 --> 00:43:10,959
about happy for me his standard but it

919
00:43:10,959 --> 00:43:13,299
turns out that I mean this mechanism

920
00:43:13,299 --> 00:43:15,219
just sucks because what it does is it

921
00:43:15,219 --> 00:43:17,829
eats up cpu cycles on your servers you

922
00:43:17,829 --> 00:43:19,660
know so you've got this to healing herbs

923
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:22,239
plants out there doing nothing but

924
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:24,789
capturing key presses the word and then

925
00:43:24,789 --> 00:43:26,979
you're pushing with audio programming on

926
00:43:26,979 --> 00:43:29,219
to a completely overloaded server so

927
00:43:29,219 --> 00:43:31,420
they seem to step back from that and

928
00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:32,739
they think you're doing more parts i

929
00:43:32,739 --> 00:43:37,509
already so quick aside for a four way

930
00:43:37,509 --> 00:43:39,969
which is stuff off the side of the farm

931
00:43:39,969 --> 00:43:43,289
service which is the obviously transport

932
00:43:43,289 --> 00:43:48,239
so it's kind of a hidden park windows

933
00:43:49,410 --> 00:43:52,449
everything in Windows everything

934
00:43:52,449 --> 00:43:54,099
remotely windows he's done releasing

935
00:43:54,099 --> 00:43:56,829
open see how many people have played

936
00:43:56,829 --> 00:43:59,079
with or know anything about sons of NCLB

937
00:43:59,079 --> 00:44:02,769
see knots lemonade these carry high

938
00:44:02,769 --> 00:44:04,569
grasses 10 years ago room wouldn't know

939
00:44:04,569 --> 00:44:07,390
anyway sorry SDC off you see really has

940
00:44:07,390 --> 00:44:08,979
one which is a shame because there's a

941
00:44:08,979 --> 00:44:12,009
protocol it sucks it's horrible horrible

942
00:44:12,009 --> 00:44:13,900
nasty and disgusting is designed for

943
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:16,299
there are two twenties processes or

944
00:44:16,299 --> 00:44:18,549
whatever when when you know having a

945
00:44:18,549 --> 00:44:20,289
network Bible before that was so

946
00:44:20,289 --> 00:44:22,929
expensive that you know you can send the

947
00:44:22,929 --> 00:44:25,479
biasing any format you just set a flag

948
00:44:25,479 --> 00:44:27,219
to say whether it's big endian a little

949
00:44:27,219 --> 00:44:28,989
onion which means twice little turn on

950
00:44:28,989 --> 00:44:32,829
the server a car at all anyway but it's

951
00:44:32,829 --> 00:44:36,489
very popular windows uses it a lot 73

952
00:44:36,489 --> 00:44:38,720
right now only supported tunnel

953
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:41,570
since we will eventually need to support

954
00:44:41,570 --> 00:44:44,090
this overall tcp sander for whoring does

955
00:44:44,090 --> 00:44:47,990
so so we need to merge that cemetery has

956
00:44:47,990 --> 00:44:51,109
some 100 Marshall encode the right way

957
00:44:51,109 --> 00:44:53,270
of doing our pcs did writer was called

958
00:44:53,270 --> 00:44:55,520
ideal file which describes the protocol

959
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:58,240
and then have that auto-generated fire

960
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:01,849
programming tool into code because we

961
00:45:01,849 --> 00:45:04,010
were stupid we need my time to start

962
00:45:04,010 --> 00:45:05,950
with we're finally getting rid of that

963
00:45:05,950 --> 00:45:08,420
then i think i believe i have this so

964
00:45:08,420 --> 00:45:09,920
you can handle all the security checks

965
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:11,900
that windows didn't have and we run off

966
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:13,580
the end of year after on the end of the

967
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:15,530
ba ba windows think bowl with that

968
00:45:15,530 --> 00:45:18,349
original think they did now but it's

969
00:45:18,349 --> 00:45:20,150
horrible to maintain for what we extend

970
00:45:20,150 --> 00:45:23,090
and we can finally got a proper boat we

971
00:45:23,090 --> 00:45:27,170
generated RPC very pillow compiler for

972
00:45:27,170 --> 00:45:29,810
third base are you a little parlor for

973
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:33,500
example for so he sneaks out whatever

974
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:36,230
you can see it but it's actually the

975
00:45:36,230 --> 00:45:39,140
registry editor on windows looking at a

976
00:45:39,140 --> 00:45:43,400
server box isn't that weird that there

977
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:44,930
you can see you're actually looking at

978
00:45:44,930 --> 00:45:49,130
the perfect smtp metal service which is

979
00:45:49,130 --> 00:45:52,430
a process running on a cyber server and

980
00:45:52,430 --> 00:45:55,520
as you can see it looks pretty much like

981
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:57,830
a windows box but it's actually working

982
00:45:57,830 --> 00:46:02,000
against Santa oh please weird huh very

983
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,670
cool so here's something else that I

984
00:46:04,670 --> 00:46:05,960
never thought would be done because it's

985
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:09,500
so hard disgusting but a commercial

986
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:10,910
company did this and the name of the

987
00:46:10,910 --> 00:46:13,369
code so here is the windows performance

988
00:46:13,369 --> 00:46:15,350
monitor actually looking

989
00:46:15,350 --> 00:46:20,450
linux box compiling samba in you and

990
00:46:20,450 --> 00:46:22,310
it's pulling the information out of such

991
00:46:22,310 --> 00:46:25,190
rock and formatting it as registry data

992
00:46:25,190 --> 00:46:27,550
and sending it back by registry balls

993
00:46:27,550 --> 00:46:31,130
howdy howdy where does the performance

994
00:46:31,130 --> 00:46:33,350
monitor actually works but it's very

995
00:46:33,350 --> 00:46:37,750
handy and here samba acting is universal

996
00:46:37,750 --> 00:46:40,160
administration tool so here is the

997
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:43,070
perfect demon being stalked by our

998
00:46:43,070 --> 00:46:46,610
audience daughter started by the windows

999
00:46:46,610 --> 00:46:50,200
service control item now you left right

1000
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:54,170
but tell me how many windows happens in

1001
00:46:54,170 --> 00:46:56,210
your organization would you trust to get

1002
00:46:56,210 --> 00:47:01,030
root on your service

1003
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:09,320
they will make this they used to this

1004
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:17,150
you can control what they didn't do so

1005
00:47:17,150 --> 00:47:20,070
let's get on to sample for now I don't

1006
00:47:20,070 --> 00:47:22,310
work two strikes and before it's like

1007
00:47:22,310 --> 00:47:25,710
fly an aeroplane dismantling it will be

1008
00:47:25,710 --> 00:47:27,960
another airplane which is also flying at

1009
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:30,800
the same time is usually long so it's

1010
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:33,540
complicated and also you might crash a

1011
00:47:33,540 --> 00:47:39,810
lot so it's kind of fiddle so I need Sam

1012
00:47:39,810 --> 00:47:41,910
for come from what is it work I watching

1013
00:47:41,910 --> 00:47:45,330
fertile is the research on Sam so

1014
00:47:45,330 --> 00:47:47,940
basically true geez smarter than the

1015
00:47:47,940 --> 00:47:50,880
average bear and he's looking at the

1016
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:52,920
time three co he finally got fed up with

1017
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:55,830
his drinking crap go through 1991 and so

1018
00:47:55,830 --> 00:47:57,360
this study's god I can do better this

1019
00:47:57,360 --> 00:48:00,300
I'm going to the end so he did it was

1020
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:04,290
originally started as a new VFX virtual

1021
00:48:04,290 --> 00:48:06,570
file system interface that would match

1022
00:48:06,570 --> 00:48:09,030
the window First Minister mathletes much

1023
00:48:09,030 --> 00:48:12,630
better and he just grew but it turned

1024
00:48:12,630 --> 00:48:15,920
out to me technology

1025
00:48:16,180 --> 00:48:18,290
stuff that we can use in the production

1026
00:48:18,290 --> 00:48:21,560
/ so we created pibil the IDL Gary

1027
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:23,890
compiler means that we will place

1028
00:48:23,890 --> 00:48:26,120
thousands and thousands of lines of

1029
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:27,920
generated code the auto-generated code

1030
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:30,820
which is easier to make sure it's secure

1031
00:48:30,820 --> 00:48:33,980
exploited change of things etc Tower

1032
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:36,410
this is start abusing other projects

1033
00:48:36,410 --> 00:48:38,420
it's essentially as i like to call it

1034
00:48:38,420 --> 00:48:40,940
c++ doubt objects in a kind of a meat

1035
00:48:40,940 --> 00:48:45,110
bicycle but it's hierarchical memory

1036
00:48:45,110 --> 00:48:48,920
allocator that allows you to use the c++

1037
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:52,300
trick of resource allocation based

1038
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:55,310
initialization and description so you

1039
00:48:55,310 --> 00:48:57,440
can essentially destroy a whole

1040
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:59,510
hierarchy of objects by just destroying

1041
00:48:59,510 --> 00:49:01,940
the top-level context transactional

1042
00:49:01,940 --> 00:49:05,000
teeny me this is going to be a plus DB

1043
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:08,090
this is going to be extremely important

1044
00:49:08,090 --> 00:49:10,460
for closets and when you have multiple

1045
00:49:10,460 --> 00:49:13,750
time perhaps across distributed system

1046
00:49:13,750 --> 00:49:16,280
closed until you've got infini manual

1047
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:18,800
giggy's getting that transports behind

1048
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:22,160
it lbb bridges and ldap search interface

1049
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:24,350
sat on top of TV so that it solves the

1050
00:49:24,350 --> 00:49:26,270
multi vexing problem that you have with

1051
00:49:26,270 --> 00:49:29,600
a trivial bakeries and then event which

1052
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:32,180
is essentially something that sits on

1053
00:49:32,180 --> 00:49:33,770
top of all the different horrible

1054
00:49:33,770 --> 00:49:35,510
methods of doing a synchronous event

1055
00:49:35,510 --> 00:49:38,910
notification and make super nice easy

1056
00:49:38,910 --> 00:49:41,760
they are we actually have a single the

1057
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:43,710
problem is with most of the immigrants I

1058
00:49:43,710 --> 00:49:45,450
a straighter said what if you look at

1059
00:49:45,450 --> 00:49:49,829
live events or there's no I'm basics and

1060
00:49:49,829 --> 00:49:51,750
not 100 singles and they can't do it the

1061
00:49:51,750 --> 00:49:55,380
right way so he Brody's a this kind of

1062
00:49:55,380 --> 00:49:57,420
clever enough to do that so so what

1063
00:49:57,420 --> 00:49:59,309
we're doing right now is sample is

1064
00:49:59,309 --> 00:50:01,380
developing these things as they become

1065
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:04,200
mature you know this people may be

1066
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:05,789
working outside the three sort of go

1067
00:50:05,789 --> 00:50:09,109
well actually you under still so

1068
00:50:09,109 --> 00:50:12,630
eventually the idea is I think it's in

1069
00:50:12,630 --> 00:50:14,220
my next slide and I'm running out of

1070
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:17,010
time here sorry Easter for people say

1071
00:50:17,010 --> 00:50:19,470
over her before yes we have horrible

1072
00:50:19,470 --> 00:50:22,770
true it is for but it's a natural that

1073
00:50:22,770 --> 00:50:25,049
is actually beneficial because what it

1074
00:50:25,049 --> 00:50:26,910
does is it allows new technologies new

1075
00:50:26,910 --> 00:50:29,039
ideas we tried out in a way that we

1076
00:50:29,039 --> 00:50:31,380
simply can't do with the production side

1077
00:50:31,380 --> 00:50:34,170
of her face unfortunately sand that is

1078
00:50:34,170 --> 00:50:37,470
too big in terms of the number of users

1079
00:50:37,470 --> 00:50:39,690
out there we just can't be as

1080
00:50:39,690 --> 00:50:43,230
irresponsible as we really are we just

1081
00:50:43,230 --> 00:50:45,240
can't break it in the way that we really

1082
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:47,640
like so thus assemble for allows things

1083
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:51,170
to be really messed up and broken and

1084
00:50:51,170 --> 00:50:53,490
what were what we're trying to do is

1085
00:50:53,490 --> 00:50:57,900
just convert the two code bases so the

1086
00:50:57,900 --> 00:51:01,109
goal is that will eventually ship a

1087
00:51:01,109 --> 00:51:02,760
working acting director you may control

1088
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:04,829
with complete file and print service and

1089
00:51:04,829 --> 00:51:06,750
what will you never we've all

1090
00:51:06,750 --> 00:51:09,630
complete what I could will look like I'm

1091
00:51:09,630 --> 00:51:12,450
not sure probably some kind of horrible

1092
00:51:12,450 --> 00:51:15,120
mutant hybrid in three heads of both

1093
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:17,640
branches hoods together probably won't

1094
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:19,110
looking exactly like Santa Porter's now

1095
00:51:19,110 --> 00:51:21,000
it's certainly Borg anything like 73

1096
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,340
years today but hopefully will look

1097
00:51:23,340 --> 00:51:25,560
better more interesting and fun to work

1098
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:28,860
on purpose so the Russians remain about

1099
00:51:28,860 --> 00:51:34,020
the ad duty mode with openldap do we use

1100
00:51:34,020 --> 00:51:36,780
under or MIT kerberos which is kind of

1101
00:51:36,780 --> 00:51:39,840
one the Curtis Wars out there how do we

1102
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:42,360
integrate the dns dhcp server but we

1103
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:43,710
need to be able to do active directory

1104
00:51:43,710 --> 00:51:46,890
properly my my this is just my personal

1105
00:51:46,890 --> 00:51:49,320
opinion is that probably two smaller

1106
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:52,350
group programs is probably five to ten

1107
00:51:52,350 --> 00:51:54,840
really active people were too small to

1108
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:58,470
always run ourselves we need to merge

1109
00:51:58,470 --> 00:52:00,750
with other open source projects you know

1110
00:52:00,750 --> 00:52:02,820
I don't mind as being the glue holds

1111
00:52:02,820 --> 00:52:05,040
these things together but I think we're

1112
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:07,890
too small to me openldap binds you know

1113
00:52:07,890 --> 00:52:11,040
MIT kerberos sander and everything else

1114
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:13,410
all in one go we meaning to you need to

1115
00:52:13,410 --> 00:52:18,870
share so these are the vote so I a

1116
00:52:18,870 --> 00:52:22,650
wonderful also executed bug challenges

1117
00:52:22,650 --> 00:52:26,820
we face going forward windows isn't a

1118
00:52:26,820 --> 00:52:29,280
static target because we have this turbo

1119
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:32,610
smashing day after Vista because

1120
00:52:32,610 --> 00:52:34,590
there was we were working with or

1121
00:52:34,590 --> 00:52:36,420
perfect the resistor released early on

1122
00:52:36,420 --> 00:52:38,310
but they take a few things between that

1123
00:52:38,310 --> 00:52:40,440
monoids so we

1124
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:43,650
to have some practice parameter so what

1125
00:52:43,650 --> 00:52:46,500
the interesting things is a big little

1126
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:50,640
tool which is eating my file service but

1127
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:53,460
so I see me too it is basically the new

1128
00:52:53,460 --> 00:52:55,589
microsoft don't means they see that this

1129
00:52:55,589 --> 00:52:59,160
is shiny and new parts of prep atop my

1130
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:02,069
the way I like to describe that is is at

1131
00:53:02,069 --> 00:53:04,319
least the six will be met treadmill once

1132
00:53:04,319 --> 00:53:06,599
be run by someone else quite a while and

1133
00:53:06,599 --> 00:53:09,240
when we finally get in front of their

1134
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:11,400
hands on the throttle you so angry right

1135
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:14,310
and so everyone sort of oh my god we are

1136
00:53:14,310 --> 00:53:16,530
walking at a steady pace and then

1137
00:53:16,530 --> 00:53:21,869
someone's under there hey newbie course

1138
00:53:21,869 --> 00:53:26,490
yeah you got a static you know bye honey

1139
00:53:26,490 --> 00:53:28,950
it's it's not pictures it's we painted

1140
00:53:28,950 --> 00:53:30,930
you would sort of reddish ruffle and

1141
00:53:30,930 --> 00:53:33,240
then already I see a few in the

1142
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:37,199
announcement is pretty cool

1143
00:53:37,199 --> 00:53:41,289
so I'm hoping to Sin City keep the old

1144
00:53:41,289 --> 00:53:44,259
and reading lesson b6 alive as long as

1145
00:53:44,259 --> 00:53:48,939
possible there's SME to essentially this

1146
00:53:48,939 --> 00:53:50,919
that when he talked for a sense server

1147
00:53:50,919 --> 00:53:52,959
it adds SME tues and you supported

1148
00:53:52,959 --> 00:53:56,650
protocol and if the server the new

1149
00:53:56,650 --> 00:53:58,419
server replies yes I support our

1150
00:53:58,419 --> 00:54:00,699
protocol the end time the organization

1151
00:54:00,699 --> 00:54:02,890
is different is essentially it's almost

1152
00:54:02,890 --> 00:54:05,049
like you said outer system packet you

1153
00:54:05,049 --> 00:54:06,519
get a response and then you start saying

1154
00:54:06,519 --> 00:54:09,579
and it has before it's kind of like guys

1155
00:54:09,579 --> 00:54:12,640
it's different he took treat and a few

1156
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:14,979
other people about six months to work it

1157
00:54:14,979 --> 00:54:18,939
out so that was horrible but we do have

1158
00:54:18,939 --> 00:54:21,400
a working plan implementation it

1159
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:22,989
wouldn't be too difficult to turn that

1160
00:54:22,989 --> 00:54:24,400
into the server and client taste and I'm

1161
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:26,619
guessing through four months if we had

1162
00:54:26,619 --> 00:54:28,539
to do a crash cradle I'm hoping that we

1163
00:54:28,539 --> 00:54:32,880
don't so there's SME to come along

1164
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:35,109
there's always knew I prefer ethical

1165
00:54:35,109 --> 00:54:36,819
awesome some interesting wrinkles coming

1166
00:54:36,819 --> 00:54:39,880
up in the authentication piece I thought

1167
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:42,729
looked too much about that but it's just

1168
00:54:42,729 --> 00:54:44,559
let's just say they the client and

1169
00:54:44,559 --> 00:54:46,659
server are pretty closing time together

1170
00:54:46,659 --> 00:54:49,029
so how's the farm throughout the service

1171
00:54:49,029 --> 00:54:51,659
Reverend interesting things to have and

1172
00:54:51,659 --> 00:54:54,609
the other thing is the server-side print

1173
00:54:54,609 --> 00:54:56,650
rendering service on print rendering is

1174
00:54:56,650 --> 00:54:58,359
interesting because it depends on

1175
00:54:58,359 --> 00:55:02,319
Windows dll's being loaded from the file

1176
00:55:02,319 --> 00:55:04,230
onto the server way

1177
00:55:04,230 --> 00:55:06,960
printer and being wrong as Windows

1178
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:10,410
processes answer we pumping so

1179
00:55:10,410 --> 00:55:12,780
server-side rendering is a big threat

1180
00:55:12,780 --> 00:55:15,720
for us hi for this talk I when I when I

1181
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:20,670
looked at the new XPS EMF those XPS is a

1182
00:55:20,670 --> 00:55:24,119
new print service eliska and I couldn't

1183
00:55:24,119 --> 00:55:27,869
see anything that may depend on server

1184
00:55:27,869 --> 00:55:30,300
side rendering so I think it's a new way

1185
00:55:30,300 --> 00:55:32,880
of doing the rendering in the planets

1186
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:35,130
hoping prevented but I think when it

1187
00:55:35,130 --> 00:55:37,200
comes down to it at least the part of me

1188
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:39,000
camera which is the network protocol

1189
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:42,930
it's simply a new a new set of raining

1190
00:55:42,930 --> 00:55:44,700
on the phone that the same old packets

1191
00:55:44,700 --> 00:55:46,920
going over the works are not to worry

1192
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:49,560
about right now alright i may get

1193
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:51,990
panicked falls from FB saying oh my god

1194
00:55:51,990 --> 00:55:54,570
we need is a warning this is not working

1195
00:55:54,570 --> 00:56:00,450
number so so coming soon what a person

1196
00:56:00,450 --> 00:56:02,400
named Max and raise it seems at least

1197
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:04,950
our own trip development row or we see

1198
00:56:04,950 --> 00:56:09,540
the accelerated video all so close that

1199
00:56:09,540 --> 00:56:12,060
sander is currently being designed and

1200
00:56:12,060 --> 00:56:14,670
coded by Trish as a test basis and

1201
00:56:14,670 --> 00:56:16,680
therefore it will probably backwater to

1202
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:20,640
Santa three is interesting changes what

1203
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:24,420
it allows is for multiple senders

1204
00:56:24,420 --> 00:56:27,810
on separate machines to share a common

1205
00:56:27,810 --> 00:56:29,700
to student file system running over

1206
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:33,240
sound something similar and all of those

1207
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:35,760
servers to provide exact window

1208
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:39,090
semantics so that's you know a fire

1209
00:56:39,090 --> 00:56:41,940
opening a word file one server will be

1210
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:44,370
seen as an open word file on another

1211
00:56:44,370 --> 00:56:46,740
server and what they are young guys have

1212
00:56:46,740 --> 00:56:47,940
some great to be like she added a

1213
00:56:47,940 --> 00:56:50,490
brilliant demo using VMware and she much

1214
00:56:50,490 --> 00:56:54,120
more powerful mine to show open office

1215
00:56:54,120 --> 00:56:56,910
from a Linux client connecting to one

1216
00:56:56,910 --> 00:57:00,450
server and a window start using

1217
00:57:00,450 --> 00:57:03,720
Microsoft Office connecting to another

1218
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:06,390
sample silver and opening the second

1219
00:57:06,390 --> 00:57:09,720
file on a distant third server albany on

1220
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:12,300
his laptop he had beefy laptop i'm a

1221
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:15,690
distributed file system and each of the

1222
00:57:15,690 --> 00:57:17,940
programs could see the others oh we got

1223
00:57:17,940 --> 00:57:19,800
familiar this file is being open bar

1224
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:21,350
another user

1225
00:57:21,350 --> 00:57:24,060
kind of thing and it all worked across

1226
00:57:24,060 --> 00:57:26,760
on two three four five machines which is

1227
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:29,940
pretty cool another thing that we really

1228
00:57:29,940 --> 00:57:33,540
need to have because of my one buzz word

1229
00:57:33,540 --> 00:57:37,530
on the slides virtualization me anyway

1230
00:57:37,530 --> 00:57:42,660
only we need to be able to to me what

1231
00:57:42,660 --> 00:57:44,610
localization means is when you

1232
00:57:44,610 --> 00:57:46,770
previously had to make 300 servers now

1233
00:57:46,770 --> 00:57:48,450
we've got the managed three thousand

1234
00:57:48,450 --> 00:57:52,830
went to the same traffic tools this is a

1235
00:57:52,830 --> 00:57:54,720
question I ask this in anymore having

1236
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:56,610
having people actually loss of their

1237
00:57:56,610 --> 00:58:02,100
choice sir I just mislaid it I managed

1238
00:58:02,100 --> 00:58:04,710
to do that I was remote had a bunch of

1239
00:58:04,710 --> 00:58:06,900
the drive the end local machine running

1240
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:12,030
and I lost our windows I knew this on

1241
00:58:12,030 --> 00:58:13,410
the network and you can simply no

1242
00:58:13,410 --> 00:58:15,930
animals on one of my appearances I just

1243
00:58:15,930 --> 00:58:18,090
couldn't know where it was so I ended up

1244
00:58:18,090 --> 00:58:19,710
having to basically Stanley aggressive

1245
00:58:19,710 --> 00:58:21,920
agent or something on opposites think

1246
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:24,930
that's where it is yeah so the

1247
00:58:24,930 --> 00:58:27,120
translation is going so traffic in

1248
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:31,110
Iceland so we need to do for Muslim

1249
00:58:31,110 --> 00:58:33,960
bagging boom buzzword bandwagon and make

1250
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:37,440
Samba very friendly for virtualization

1251
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:40,380
and that means in able to deploy a samba

1252
00:58:40,380 --> 00:58:41,039
server

1253
00:58:41,039 --> 00:58:43,979
machine and having pick up its estimate

1254
00:58:43,979 --> 00:58:45,779
of our I've Kurdish we know isn't

1255
00:58:45,779 --> 00:58:48,569
immediate nom we also need encrypted

1256
00:58:48,569 --> 00:58:50,729
sense because senator and as before Matt

1257
00:58:50,729 --> 00:58:52,469
occurred to transform and we have to be

1258
00:58:52,469 --> 00:58:55,439
better or at least as good and we're

1259
00:58:55,439 --> 00:58:57,809
going to do new policies soon we will

1260
00:58:57,809 --> 00:59:02,789
tackle any Linux world so does with

1261
00:59:02,789 --> 00:59:06,209
policies okay so i can't get 10 minutes

1262
00:59:06,209 --> 00:59:08,489
at a time so our variations that you

1263
00:59:08,489 --> 00:59:10,439
didn't want student at all from the ones

1264
00:59:10,439 --> 00:59:19,349
now questions comments yes so the

1265
00:59:19,349 --> 00:59:20,910
question was work I don't even fix

1266
00:59:20,910 --> 00:59:23,999
initially to or episodic making life

1267
00:59:23,999 --> 00:59:27,059
difficult SME to disrupt things like

1268
00:59:27,059 --> 00:59:29,299
transaction support and it also has

1269
00:59:29,299 --> 00:59:32,429
32-bit weeks and robbers alphabet fix

1270
00:59:32,429 --> 00:59:34,650
claimed the website Arthur Lee who is

1271
00:59:34,650 --> 00:59:38,189
great in global in large latency

1272
00:59:38,189 --> 00:59:41,099
connections so fantastic so tricks

1273
00:59:41,099 --> 00:59:44,099
decided to watch some test this so he

1274
00:59:44,099 --> 00:59:46,799
brought up Windows Explorer and made a

1275
00:59:46,799 --> 00:59:49,079
connection you know looking at a thunder

1276
00:59:49,079 --> 00:59:50,969
directory many connection virus a bit

1277
00:59:50,969 --> 00:59:53,729
and he came to the packets mainly the

1278
00:59:53,729 --> 00:59:56,009
same thing with mr. doing SME to on the

1279
00:59:56,009 --> 00:59:58,229
same directory and the number of round

1280
00:59:58,229 --> 01:00:01,310
trip server is twice as many

1281
01:00:01,310 --> 01:00:04,700
so I think you can decide what I mean to

1282
01:00:04,700 --> 01:00:09,660
work our way up sexy legs this there's

1283
01:00:09,660 --> 01:00:17,940
an MC question okay with it oh I'm sorry

1284
01:00:17,940 --> 01:00:21,420
yes hook a good point Walker we have a

1285
01:00:21,420 --> 01:00:23,130
conference coming up if you're very

1286
01:00:23,130 --> 01:00:24,630
interested in Santa you want to get

1287
01:00:24,630 --> 01:00:26,880
involved in development we have the

1288
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:28,770
worldwide summer conference coming up

1289
01:00:28,770 --> 01:00:31,490
with using goettingen in germany on

1290
01:00:31,490 --> 01:00:37,530
april me when we third to the 27 so good

1291
01:00:37,530 --> 01:00:42,300
Simon a speedo oh god as a repeat of our

1292
01:00:42,300 --> 01:00:45,210
member just to google searches under XP
