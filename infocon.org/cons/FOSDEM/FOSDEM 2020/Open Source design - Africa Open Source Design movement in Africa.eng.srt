1
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:09,679
one

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:12,000
good morning i'm a little bit out

3
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:14,080
because i actually attended this um

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,759
event hostel by google where

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,520
the google sum of code mentors and

6
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:18,880
students come together just like a

7
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,960
hangout last night

8
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,160
and i go home really late and then i had

9
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,960
to wake up very early

10
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:27,039
to be here right on time so i'm like

11
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,480
sorry about the door face

12
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:31,039
so today i'm going to be talking to you

13
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:34,880
about the open source design movement in

14
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:36,960
africa by open source community africa

15
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,079
my name is peace ogeme but i have a

16
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,760
nickname perry

17
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:41,840
that i always like a lot of people to

18
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,120
call me i'm a design contributor at

19
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,879
sugarlabs

20
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,480
i'm also leading the design team at open

21
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:48,800
source community africa

22
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,319
i advocate greatly for accessibility

23
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,718
inclusion and open source

24
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,760
specifically open source design you can

25
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:58,879
find me on twitter

26
00:00:53,760 --> 00:01:03,199
peace underscore gma o g e m h

27
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:05,759
okay let's kick start africa

28
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:07,759
um the first thing i want to say and i

29
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:11,760
want everyone to take home

30
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:14,159
today is that africa is not a country

31
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,040
i was in france last year and someone

32
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,040
walked up to me

33
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:20,720
at the museum i was like you're from

34
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,720
africa right do you know phillip

35
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:28,880
and i'm like africa is a huge continent

36
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,320
made up of so many people i'm from

37
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,920
nigeria

38
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:34,000
who is feeling we have so many phillips

39
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,680
in nigeria so like there's always this

40
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,840
misconception about africa

41
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,799
it's been a very small space the little

42
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,600
group of people that

43
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:43,040
know each other so yeah please africa is

44
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:46,079
not a country it's actually like

45
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:47,119
a huge continent made up of over 1

46
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:49,039
billion people

47
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:51,360
so it's not possible for me to know

48
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,360
philip

49
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:58,240
in africa we have um 57 countries

50
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:00,640
with the population of over 1 billion

51
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:02,158
people now out of these 57 countries

52
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,759
instead of talking about how diverse

53
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:06,560
africa is i'm going to be using

54
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:07,360
nigeria as a case study just to drive

55
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,759
home

56
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:12,160
how much diversity we have over there in

57
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:12,160
africa

58
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,440
so nigeria is where i'm from in india we

59
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:18,560
have over

60
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:22,000
250 ethnic groups and we speak over

61
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:25,040
500 languages is that the west

62
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,440
and then we have over two million

63
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:29,359
people i think the four of us right here

64
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,200
from we are actually four from nigeria

65
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:35,280
but we are from different parts of

66
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:37,040
nigeria i am something the the dark guy

67
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,640
we are from the south part the southern

68
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,440
part of nigeria and that is from the

69
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,599
eastern part

70
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:43,760
and is from the northern part so like we

71
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:45,440
actually speak four different languages

72
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,879
the only language we have in common is

73
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:50,079
english

74
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:51,040
so yeah nigeria is that diverse and out

75
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,640
of this

76
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:56,079
out of this um population we have 60 of

77
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,518
this population

78
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,519
almost as a percent of this population

79
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:01,519
as youths youth just

80
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:03,440
leaving high school just getting into

81
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:05,360
the university just just

82
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:07,920
finishing from the university and then

83
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:11,200
in nigeria nigeria has always been this

84
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:12,319
oil first country where you have to

85
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,599
actually study

86
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:17,200
engineering gas or petroleum to be

87
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:18,238
actually seen as someone who is actually

88
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:21,599
making progress

89
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:25,120
in the society so if you are at home

90
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:27,440
always on your computer or your phone

91
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,200
my parents just tell me i'm very lazy

92
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,480
see me on my computer is like

93
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,760
it's like you're wasting your life

94
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,560
apparently because you're supposed to be

95
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,840
studying

96
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,519
engineering and then if you're not

97
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,200
studying engineering you should be

98
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:40,000
studying medicine alone

99
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:41,440
so outside this field is like what are

100
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,280
you doing with your life

101
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,200
like you're just wasting yourself so

102
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,200
that's like the whole notion but then

103
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:49,280
in the last couple of months a lot of

104
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:52,238
youths have been pushing from

105
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,200
the oil first into technology so most

106
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:55,040
youths

107
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,879
right there in nigeria and africa are

108
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,760
getting to come into technology learning

109
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:00,159
about tech

110
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,879
and how to code learn how to design and

111
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:03,760
then

112
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:04,159
you find majority of these ones actually

113
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,679
from

114
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:07,920
fields that are not related to computer

115
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:10,640
science i actually just finished from

116
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:13,280
the university i studied microbiology

117
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:14,079
and now i'm designing you find a ton of

118
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,079
people like that

119
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,120
back there in nigeria who did not study

120
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,880
computer science

121
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,320
but are currently now into the world of

122
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,960
tech so

123
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,240
the knowledge itself it's like people

124
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,680
are trying to grasp it

125
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,240
and then there should be there's to be a

126
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,840
time back then where you have

127
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,240
this bridge between developers and

128
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:35,280
designers designers used to have this

129
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:37,120
very very very very small group and they

130
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:39,758
have a lot of developers well

131
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,800
in the last few couple of years and

132
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:43,280
months

133
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,040
the the population between the designers

134
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,479
and developers are kind of like

135
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,960
measured up people are beginning to

136
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:49,280
appreciate design and beginning to know

137
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:53,359
that

138
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:54,799
actually design is quite important

139
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,320
i wouldn't say even more important than

140
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,440
code but it's like really really

141
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,960
important so people are actually

142
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,600
beginning to actually understand that

143
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,039
and

144
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,960
they're actually starting to get the

145
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:06,240
whole idea of design

146
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:08,400
but then we have this problem of

147
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,240
people who actually know about design

148
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:12,080
and people who actually know

149
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,759
that as a designer you can contribute to

150
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:17,359
open source too

151
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:19,280
in um in africa we get a lot of people

152
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,479
like this you should take note of this

153
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,280
with a hand because you're going to see

154
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:24,560
her later on

155
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:26,159
in the stock getting really surprised

156
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,840
when you talk about open source designs

157
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,520
like

158
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,359
the few ones i know about open cells

159
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:34,320
feel like it's just

160
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,280
for code contributions so i'm a designer

161
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,759
open source

162
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,960
nah it's not for me so they get really

163
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:40,400
surprised when you talk about open

164
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,960
source design and then

165
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,758
one thing about nigeria is most of the

166
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:47,039
techies are

167
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:48,320
very very willing to learn so they come

168
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:51,199
crowd your dms

169
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:53,039
on twitter tag you actually what open

170
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:53,520
source design is and they all want to

171
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:55,199
like

172
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,799
try to get into the space and really

173
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,800
understand what it is

174
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:02,319
so what oscar is trying to do in africa

175
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:04,960
is increase the awareness of open source

176
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:05,759
at the same time making it possible to

177
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,440
actually tell

178
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:09,120
others that open source is not just

179
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:11,360
about code contributions

180
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,440
but it also includes that minority group

181
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,520
like designers and documentation

182
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:17,360
bulletin is leading the documentation

183
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:19,840
team back there in africa

184
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,960
so we actually like kind of like include

185
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,638
everybody

186
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,799
and different ways we actually do that

187
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:26,720
is we host meetups

188
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,720
and workshops where we tell people about

189
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,000
open source about open source

190
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,479
about open source design and

191
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,880
documentation and then we kind of like

192
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:35,758
link them up to organizations that

193
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,000
actually accept

194
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:38,960
design contributions starting up with

195
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,080
open source

196
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:43,599
um i said out at 2017 actually

197
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,280
i said out with an organization that

198
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,919
actually did not appreciate

199
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,719
design contributions so i have to go

200
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:50,799
through

201
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:53,120
really long dialogues to actually

202
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:55,520
propose a design change and then

203
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,400
you get the very technical maintainer

204
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,039
saying

205
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:01,198
it's not important after a series of

206
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:03,199
months of conversation on why

207
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:05,199
this has to change or why we have to

208
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:08,080
actually have a sprint or something

209
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:09,280
so like most some of these organizations

210
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,520
open source organizations

211
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,318
still aren't still like really open to

212
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,799
designers

213
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:17,039
so we kind of like try to guide

214
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,880
designers from africa on how to actually

215
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:20,800
start contributing to organizations that

216
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,159
actually accept design contributions and

217
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,919
if you want to go into the

218
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,199
organizations that are kind of like

219
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:27,919
difficult to get into

220
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:29,199
ways to actually go around it and then

221
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:32,080
drop your contribution so

222
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:32,560
we actually also link them up to open

223
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:36,159
source

224
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:38,800
projects currently we have about

225
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,680
15 to 20 designers who are like really

226
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,160
willing

227
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:44,080
to actually get into open source and

228
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,840
start working on open source project

229
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:48,719
we started out open source community

230
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:50,878
africa in 2018 so it's like

231
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,560
barely two years and we've covered over

232
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:55,280
five countries in africa

233
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,960
and over 11 cities and each of the

234
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,719
cities actually host

235
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:00,960
different meetups where they talk about

236
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,319
open source embody people into

237
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:05,840
open source open source design

238
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:05,840
documentation and also code

239
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:11,280
now this month i almost said next month

240
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,799
it's actually funny because it's like

241
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:15,440
really close we're actually hosting the

242
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:18,639
first open source conference in africa

243
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:20,800
called the open source festival

244
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:22,240
and we are hosting the first sustained

245
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:25,039
summit also in africa

246
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:27,199
so it's like a three days um festival

247
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:29,520
where we have the sustained africa

248
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:31,520
conversation on how to actually sustain

249
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,478
open source in africa since it has come

250
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,838
to stay

251
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:36,000
and then the remaining two days are

252
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:37,680
actually for the conference

253
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
so yeah i don't know did you remember

254
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:43,120
abigail from the previous

255
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,519
so abigail is actually giving a talk on

256
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,880
designers can be open source open source

257
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:49,360
too so abigail

258
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:50,800
this year actually um became a google

259
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,399
coding mentor

260
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,160
from actually learning about open source

261
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,959
and she has made sherman just progress

262
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,560
since then

263
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:58,640
so she's coming to the festival to

264
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:00,880
actually tell all the designers

265
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:02,160
about her journey so far and how she's

266
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:05,680
been able to tackle

267
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:09,680
being um an open sorcerer and that's

268
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:12,959
really my needs circle

269
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:16,719
the goal of oscar is actually to onboard

270
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:20,239
as much open sorcerers

271
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:22,959
so it is the word designers especially

272
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,519
and then like those just in the minority

273
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:25,839
group

274
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:27,200
getting them to understand that open

275
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:30,320
source is not

276
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:31,440
just about contributing code it actually

277
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,480
goes beyond that

278
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:39,600
if you're a designer we are here for you

279
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:39,600
you can find us on twitter

280
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:45,439
the open source community africa you can

281
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,440
find a hundred there

282
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:49,240
then this is to get more information

283
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:53,680
about the festival

284
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:53,680
festival.oscar africa.com

285
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:05,839
[Applause]

286
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:05,839
mercy

287
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:35,519
one question that is in

288
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,560
africa in europe the balance the gender

289
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:39,760
balance

290
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:43,040
between code in encoder is mostly

291
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:44,640
the biased or the main it is the same in

292
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:47,120
africa because it's a younger country it

293
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:50,319
is a

294
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:53,680
yeah we still have we're still okay i

295
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,680
have to repeat the question right

296
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:59,440
okay um sorry again i'm sorry it's about

297
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:01,360
gender balancing

298
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,760
gender balance in africa in technology

299
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:06,320
right yeah we actually still have this

300
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:08,399
whole gender balance issue that's why

301
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:11,839
you have um communities like chico

302
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:15,120
africa um um

303
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:16,640
the other women in women tech

304
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:19,120
yeah we have that that's like a google

305
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:22,319
program so so there's still this

306
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:25,040
more guy more male figure than

307
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,320
female so another thing oscar is trying

308
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:28,079
to do is bridge the gap

309
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,600
and that's why in our festival we

310
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:32,239
actually had like

311
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,959
300 tickets for the festival dedicated

312
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:36,160
to

313
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:37,760
just female technologists and then we

314
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:39,839
actually gave them sponsorship so they

315
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:43,120
can actually come to the event so yeah

316
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:46,000
there's still that gender gap in africa

317
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,000
a very huge one

318
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:51,040
anybody else got any questions

319
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:58,000
i know what i've been the biggest

320
00:11:55,279 --> 00:12:00,480
drivers in that changing narrative

321
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,079
between having a career as a having a

322
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,320
successful career as an engineer

323
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:06,560
in nigeria and having a successful

324
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:08,959
career

325
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:11,518
oh i would say um the narrative is

326
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:13,518
actually changing because

327
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:14,720
the generation of our parents they all

328
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:17,839
always feel like

329
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:19,920
you have to actually study engineering

330
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:21,200
because the country itself is actually

331
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,560
like an oil first

332
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,320
country so if you're not doing

333
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:26,000
engineering it's like

334
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,839
but then there are a few persons who are

335
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,440
going to take and then they've been like

336
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:31,360
really successful

337
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:33,680
other people said i'm like okay if i can

338
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:36,079
do this and be successful

339
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:39,839
why not and then they all like start

340
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:39,839
getting into it

341
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:47,600
so you mentioned that there were you

342
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,600
were trying to pick

343
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,959
the open source project that would

344
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,680
accept

345
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:54,638
design contributions uh would you like

346
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:58,079
to name a few

347
00:12:54,639 --> 00:13:00,639
that were particularly welcoming yeah

348
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:02,160
so um i actually contributed to sugar

349
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:03,519
labs

350
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,040
at that time when i said contributions

351
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:07,040
it was really difficult to actually on

352
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:09,199
both designers but now it's quite easy

353
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:10,079
because like every day and then i just

354
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,920
get them in

355
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:13,199
then open collective is another

356
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:16,319
organization that actually

357
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:18,720
accepts good design contributions then

358
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:20,240
on open design um website you can

359
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,480
actually see a bunch

360
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:26,079
of design organizations that actually

361
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:26,079
accept design contributions yeah

362
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,279
anybody else

363
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:36,319
i've got a question for you so you study

364
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:40,320
biology

365
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:43,519
microbiology um

366
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:46,480
how the hell did you find open

367
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:47,440
as well open source software and design

368
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,800
i'm curious

369
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:53,600
so i would say um i'm from

370
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,959
that typical nigerian home that my

371
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,560
parents actually want them to study

372
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:58,880
medicine

373
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:00,638
and then it was like i had to stay at

374
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:02,720
home for like three years

375
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:04,160
trying to tell them that i have no

376
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,079
interest in the health

377
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,360
department i don't study medicine i had

378
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:10,399
to stay home for three years

379
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,199
when i in the end after the whole back

380
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:12,560
and forth

381
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:14,399
they actually made me go to the

382
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,518
investigating microbiology but when i

383
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:17,760
got to school

384
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:19,279
i started hanging out with meetups so

385
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,880
one thing one thing very common in

386
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:23,120
nigeria is that we have

387
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:25,279
just small meet ups like oscar there's

388
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:27,120
some um the gdg

389
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:28,720
and the rest of them having like smaller

390
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,680
meetups in school talking about

391
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,839
technology

392
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:33,519
so in my first year i actually started

393
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:34,160
attending some of this meetup and then i

394
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:36,560
attended

395
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:38,319
one design sprint when they gave us like

396
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:40,079
they gave us this persona then it

397
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,760
they gave us a problem and they was to

398
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:42,638
actually draft a solution and then it

399
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,800
was like

400
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:46,079
really cool and i say attending job i

401
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,880
started taking courses on

402
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:50,399
audacity everything was kind of like

403
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:52,959
personal i started taking like

404
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:53,920
buying courses i go to school in the

405
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:56,800
morning at night

406
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:58,319
i'm like on my computer trying to learn

407
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,599
and then when i was done with school

408
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:02,320
last month i was like

409
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,279
dad i'm done living your life it's time

410
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:06,160
to take up my

411
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:06,720
two so that's actually how i took the

412
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:09,600
shift

413
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:11,040
to technology and then i knew about

414
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,639
sugar labs from something

415
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,399
where i met him like the first month i

416
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:16,399
actually said learning about technology

417
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:19,360
so he told me about sugar labs and then

418
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:23,360
i started making little contributions

419
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:23,360
and then he just blew up from there yeah

420
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,720
are there any other places in africa

421
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:37,359
where there's a kind of

422
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:41,839
community developing any specifics

423
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:41,839
are there any other hubs in africa

424
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:54,719
i didn't quite get the question so

425
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:56,959
samsung is actually a name of a person

426
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:59,519
that's something there i don't know if

427
00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:01,599
that's what you're actually asking

428
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:01,600
i

429
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:10,319
where you're think are you concentrating

430
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:15,440
on lagos

431
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:15,440
maybe yeah i think i think yes

432
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:21,440
vegas is the biggest because of it's the

433
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,240
biggest city in africa

434
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:25,040
right the population is so huge and it's

435
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,880
uh

436
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,800
because of nigeria influence with the

437
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:30,399
continent to make more sense for

438
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:32,399
a lot of organizations like google

439
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:34,480
microsoft you know

440
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:36,240
all the silicon valley companies coming

441
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:38,079
to like have offices

442
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,360
but in terms of like communities and i

443
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:42,959
know for sure that this big

444
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:43,440
in um larry kenyatta's one in egypt

445
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:46,560
there's

446
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,959
one in south africa um i think rwanda is

447
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,518
also

448
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:50,319
really big yeah i would say like a lot

449
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:52,480
of countries

450
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:54,399
but the fact that um like also in

451
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:59,360
nigeria seems to be the

452
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:59,360
always most tough country

453
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:05,839
um

454
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:21,678
so we have like another

455
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:23,439
four minutes before the changeover we

456
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:27,360
can

457
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:30,880
finish now or if people want to you know

458
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:33,840
keep discussing things up to you

459
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,840
hey

460
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:38,559
um yeah outside nigeria yeah we actually

461
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:42,000
have

462
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:42,000
um let's go to the map

463
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:46,400
so we have um a chapter we actually call

464
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,639
them chapters

465
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,679
we have a chapter in syria alone this is

466
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,600
nigeria

467
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:52,720
some of the scissors we have another one

468
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:55,439
in kenya

469
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:58,080
we have in ethiopia too so like the goal

470
00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:00,400
of oscar is actually to get out to

471
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:01,678
so many african countries as possible

472
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,679
just to stand up so

473
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:04,720
once someone reached out to us from each

474
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:09,919
of this country we just

475
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:09,919
kind of like on board them and then meet

476
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:19,280
i ups for example the institution my

477
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:21,600
study has some program to help

478
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:23,520
these countries and they should provide

479
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:26,240
even technology to develop

480
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:27,360
software or to install radio

481
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:30,720
telecommunication

482
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:33,280
or spreading the internet

483
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,760
there is this markov project for example

484
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:37,440
about

485
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:37,440
and then working a lot with engineers

486
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,399
yeah i think we have smaller communities

487
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,639
in school

488
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,000
we call them school chapters yeah i

489
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:57,840
don't know i'm not sure if

490
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:57,840
that's like an answer to your question

491
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:17,678
okay by inclusion i actually mean

492
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,520
inclusion in design

493
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:21,200
like those with disabilities and the

494
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:24,480
rest of them yeah not like

495
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:26,640
general then on an emotional level

496
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,760
bringing balancing the gender between

497
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,160
male and female

498
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,160
basically

499
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:36,640
okay so um my organization sugar labs we

500
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,960
actually have this

501
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,840
desktop environment for kids where we

502
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,919
actually take

503
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:44,159
inclusion and accessibility very

504
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:45,039
seriously we think about kids with color

505
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:48,480
blindness

506
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:50,960
those that have like mostly um

507
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:52,480
impairments seen so when creating our

508
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,520
components our design component will

509
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,200
make sure that

510
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:57,440
we actually have components that

511
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:59,679
actually suits this particular set of

512
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,679
people

513
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,880
so how do you yeah that how do you test

514
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:12,320
for that or how do you

515
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:15,679
ensure that it is accessible

516
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:17,520
okay so um we come up with like um

517
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:19,520
certain options and then there are

518
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,240
people who actually go and do the actual

519
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,720
testing

520
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:24,159
so in nigeria i actually don't have so

521
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:27,520
many people actually using

522
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:29,679
um the desktop in india i have only very

523
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:31,918
few schools so go to the schools

524
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:33,039
actually actual students use it and how

525
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:37,679
they react to it

526
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:37,679
then get the data try to reform again

527
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,320
do you have connections with the

528
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:49,039
openstreetmap community

529
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,039
the what i know

530
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:54,240
yeah i saw i saw someone from there i

531
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,840
think it was yesterday i actually just

532
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,240
heard about it yesterday for the first

533
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:59,678
time

534
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,679
yeah we got talking yesterday

535
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:05,120
okay maybe one more question or just

536
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:07,520
coming to

537
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,520
i don't know

538
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:17,840
okay one more question maybe

539
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:32,720
infrastructure oh yeah when you come to

540
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,200
par

541
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,640
it's actually like a big problem very

542
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:39,679
big problem in nigeria

543
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:41,120
i'll use myself as a case study so i

544
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:41,600
used to stay around school when i was in

545
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,918
school

546
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:45,360
and then we had par issues so i have to

547
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:48,000
go to like

548
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:49,760
several hubs a bit far from school to

549
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,440
actually get my computer charged

550
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:53,440
and in the middle of the night it goes

551
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,080
off and then i start looking for like

552
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,960
enable

553
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:58,879
that has a gene let's change my system

554
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:01,280
then before i actually got the gin so in

555
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:02,559
in nigeria the part where i stay you

556
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:05,039
actually have to have

557
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:05,840
like a support system for power and then

558
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:09,200
we have

559
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:12,799
um really expensive internet

560
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:14,640
you get to spend like a thousand 150

561
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:16,320
dollars on inside mostly

562
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,679
just to make sure that you are like

563
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,918
always online

564
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:21,280
so it's like the internet consumption is

565
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:23,200
crazy expensive

566
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:25,039
and part two is not but then there are

567
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,159
some areas that actually have good power

568
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:29,679
supply

569
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:30,159
yeah so if i could answer that i would

570
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:33,520
say

571
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:35,760
so two things um power is actually

572
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:37,120
um i wouldn't say a general african

573
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,960
problem it's just

574
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:40,559
kind of for some reason still particular

575
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:42,799
to some part of nigeria

576
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:45,200
and if you want to stay in a place where

577
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:47,760
you you know receive 24 hours faster

578
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,880
you should be ready to start playing

579
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:51,840
like

580
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:53,679
you know um stop people talking as

581
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:55,600
expensive as san francisco

582
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:57,360
or if you want to like harvest like

583
00:22:55,600 --> 00:23:01,120
three or four hours international

584
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:04,158
or a great um mvps you pay a lot

585
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:06,080
so the point is um to try to leave

586
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:07,440
a very comfortable lifestyle with

587
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:09,039
internet and power

588
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:12,880
in some part of the country in nigeria

589
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:12,879
you really need to be on books

590
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:19,039
okay so that's going to last question

591
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,360
because we need to

592
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:24,799
do our change over so thank you very

593
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:27,280
much peace for really interesting

594
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:30,960
cute so i just wanted to rephrase or

595
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,960
remind you guys that africa is like a

596
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:39,199
country

597
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,199
you
