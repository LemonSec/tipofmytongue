00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,840
unify my output

9
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,680
no okay i need to look in the other

10
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:45,120
direction doesn't matter

11
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:47,039
or maybe maybe

12
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,239
okay i shouldn't have to ah no it works

13
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:50,160
sorry sorry

14
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:52,800
i should have done this earlier okay so

15
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:55,360
infrastructure review um

16
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,919
the subtitle is very important this is

17
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,760
like the

18
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,680
third year in a row when we didn't have

19
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:02,800
any major incidents

20
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:05,040
which and and things are settling down

21
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,798
uh same as always i'm going to give a

22
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,400
quick overview of of basically the

23
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:10,080
current state because we always have new

24
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,960
people and also what changed over the

25
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:14,240
years

26
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:15,679
and then uncommonly for lightning talks

27
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,880
we actually have questions

28
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:20,560
so we will be passing the mic around so

29
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,720
anything you want to know you're more

30
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:26,400
than welcome to ask

31
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:27,200
so this is almost the same talk as last

32
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,799
year and the

33
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,280
year before which is really really good

34
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:34,640
for us um of course this means

35
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:36,079
um we it becomes a little bit more more

36
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:39,439
settled

37
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:41,199
uh i started doing infrastructure taking

38
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:44,758
over the video team and such a

39
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:48,240
video network for the active network uh

40
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:49,280
2015-ish and everything was on fire all

41
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,079
the time

42
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:54,000
at the same time in all the places which

43
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:55,360
obviously was not very nice on

44
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,799
our nerves and sleep cycle and

45
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:02,320
everything and that got majorly improved

46
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:04,640
um we actually like literally in those

47
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:07,520
20 years when we had foster

48
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,000
this the third year where staff could

49
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,318
actually

50
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,360
sit down and not run in circles all the

51
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:14,560
time

52
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:17,599
like the last 17 years before that were

53
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:19,840
maybe not as nice i could even spend

54
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:22,560
half a day in my death room

55
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,000
without having having to run to take to

56
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:27,360
put out fires

57
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,720
um and like the first year we had this

58
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,319
people were super nervous because

59
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,959
something is about to happen something

60
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:33,040
must break

61
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:34,239
everything is working this is not normal

62
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,640
and people are getting

63
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:37,840
more relaxed which is again really good

64
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,480
for for us so

65
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,599
we have this place of stability we don't

66
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,200
need to

67
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:45,518
throw everything out the window and

68
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:48,799
re-implement within a week

69
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:50,000
like we have a place of stability and we

70
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,760
actually really get to get

71
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,400
a lot of sleep when compared to the

72
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:56,399
years before which is really really nice

73
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,959
core infra is basically the same as last

74
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:02,080
year we still have the asr 1006

75
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:04,319
which is doing um all the net stuff it's

76
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,360
in acls it's doing dhcp it's doing all

77
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:07,920
the vlans

78
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,840
for the wi-fi it's doing the bgb

79
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:12,480
upstream to colt

80
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,159
we have the same two servers which are

81
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,840
now really fully ansible so we

82
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:17,519
actually redeployed them last week and

83
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,200
nothing broke which was super nice

84
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:20,720
well actually one dashboard broke but

85
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,480
else like

86
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,760
we we are at the place where we can

87
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,599
really have this

88
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,599
conference out of a box and be really

89
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:29,200
quick about it or monitoring still

90
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:30,159
promises in grafana we are super happy

91
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:33,440
with this

92
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:36,239
and uh we put the public dashboard uh on

93
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:37,440
on the cortex cluster by grafana so

94
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:40,480
that's backed by some

95
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:41,120
actual uh like we don't get hammered

96
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,879
into death

97
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,280
uh when when i tweet about dashboard

98
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:46,560
foster orc like it actually stays stable

99
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,360
which is nice

100
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,720
um the video box have had they always

101
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,519
have a completely new version

102
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:55,200
or somewhat new version um you can see

103
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:57,360
all the updates in the

104
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,560
in the repository and also there is a

105
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,920
talk which

106
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:03,840
ended i think like 40 minutes ago

107
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:06,319
where they go into detail about how

108
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:08,720
those things are actually done

109
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:10,640
same as last year those video boxes

110
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:12,319
stream into

111
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:14,238
the render farm which we'll be seeing a

112
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:16,639
picture of in a few seconds

113
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:18,560
and those also transcode everything for

114
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:20,639
streaming offsite and from there it's

115
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,639
duplicated to everyone who wants to who

116
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:26,080
wants to watch the videos

117
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:28,160
and anyone who is who's a speaker or a

118
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:31,280
deferred manager you will get

119
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,080
emails pointing to s review which allows

120
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:35,039
you to self

121
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,840
cut your your your talks which is super

122
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,919
nice

123
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:40,159
if any of you are organizing conferences

124
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:41,840
this is really really nice because

125
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,360
you have the overview of the different

126
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,119
audio streams you have if you have

127
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,040
several video streams you can

128
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,880
choose what do you want to see when does

129
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,240
it start when does it end does this need

130
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,840
some improvement maybe

131
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,840
maybe it needs some cleaning up of the

132
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,280
audio track you can give this feedback

133
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:58,320
to the video team they can

134
00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:00,799
clean up do whatever republish it for

135
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:02,800
for your cutting and then you can put

136
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,919
exactly where your talk starts where it

137
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,000
ends

138
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:07,758
which is super nice because else we

139
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,360
would have to do literally hundreds and

140
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:11,919
hundreds of reviews

141
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,120
which i think the record was we got more

142
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:16,560
or less

143
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:20,320
done uh after the next foster which

144
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:21,680
kind of sucked so um paralyzing this and

145
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,360
giving this to the actual speakers and

146
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,720
definite manager is super super nice

147
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,720
because this means we can

148
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,479
we can paralyze and if you're doing

149
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:32,960
conference i highly suggest

150
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:32,960
you do something similar render farm

151
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:41,840
yes it is literally a a

152
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,840
heap of think pads

153
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,800
same as the years before we buy those

154
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:50,160
bulk off of ebay

155
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,800
all the same model we use them this

156
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,840
weekend

157
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:55,600
and then we sell them at cost uh at the

158
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,520
info desk that usually happens on the

159
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,280
saturday so if you want to have a cheap

160
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:01,758
laptop which is also

161
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:03,039
has been used for fosdem uh you can get

162
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,440
it we even leave the data on them

163
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:07,440
because

164
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:09,280
it's not secret data um

165
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,639
and the nice thing is every year we get

166
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:13,119
a quicker machine because

167
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:13,840
every year we just buy like the next

168
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:18,000
delta of

169
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:21,919
of machine these are the x2 250s

170
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,759
um yeah and it works and also like it

171
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:26,000
scales really nicely if you have 10 more

172
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,840
def rooms just put a few more laptops

173
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,080
and that's it

174
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,840
and they have built-in ups so if you

175
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,758
have a power outage they actually keep

176
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:37,359
on running which is also nice

177
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:40,960
yep one thing we did change

178
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:44,400
is we changed our dean s64

179
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:45,520
to cordinus which is super brand

180
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,919
spanking new

181
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,639
ben literally cuts not even a release

182
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:50,318
like he's

183
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:52,240
one of our team members is a maintainer

184
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:53,440
of coordinates and this is an

185
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,000
experimental branch

186
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:58,000
running the in s64 just for here and it

187
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,919
worked and we load tested it or you all

188
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,479
load tested it a little

189
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:04,400
and we actually had 50 reduction in cpu

190
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:06,400
usage as compared to bind

191
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,599
uh of course everyone hates bind i mean

192
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,599
it works and it

193
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:11,280
keeps the internet alive but no one

194
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:14,880
likes it

195
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:16,799
some timelines router installation is

196
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:20,000
more or less static that's totally fine

197
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,960
network up we actually improved by one

198
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,280
full hour

199
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:24,318
for the passive cabling which was super

200
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,960
nice um

201
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:29,120
like as you can see like the the 2015

202
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:32,400
one

203
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:34,000
that was really bad when i got

204
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,159
when i got to leave here at like five in

205
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,240
the morning and things have worked

206
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,840
back then we had two opening talks one

207
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,000
with we have network and one we are

208
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,679
sorry we don't have network

209
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,599
so things really improved same for the

210
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,599
monitoring monitoring actually

211
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:49,680
was here year round the servers ran

212
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:50,479
through uh and except for that redeploy

213
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,680
we

214
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:55,758
had monitoring 24 7 for the whole year

215
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,960
it didn't monitor a lot but like we had

216
00:07:55,759 --> 00:08:00,000
it running so that's

217
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:02,479
also super nice video team also improved

218
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,400
2016 was kind of icky because we lost

219
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:05,919
quite some quite some video content as

220
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:10,318
you can see

221
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:12,240
like 26 rooms times two hours that hurts

222
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:13,919
so they also get more sleep like

223
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,400
literally a few of the video team uh

224
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:17,919
slept

225
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:21,039
in in the knock a few years ago so that

226
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:22,400
all this gets better which is is nice

227
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:24,639
uh for next year we want to have

228
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,318
centralized locking uh through loki

229
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:27,680
so everyone can see what's happening at

230
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:29,280
the same time

231
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,759
all the video boxes and such will also

232
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:33,439
do uh all their logging to a central

233
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:34,399
instance where you can go deeper into

234
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,320
stuff

235
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:37,679
we have a dashboard i invite you to

236
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,279
hammer it so it gets

237
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:42,239
it goes down but it doesn't go down but

238
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:44,880
hammer it if you want

239
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,839
pretty much all our stuff is in there or

240
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,959
in the video

241
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:51,200
thing and also we are actively

242
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:53,439
talking to people trying to help them

243
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,760
bootstrap their own conferences

244
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,560
we actually had several groups of people

245
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,040
which we

246
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,760
showed through all our info desk knock

247
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,439
and such

248
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,120
so they get a feeling of how we do

249
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,920
things and explain how to

250
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,959
how to run a conference if you have a

251
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,760
conference

252
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:11,680
which is obviously same in in intention

253
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,399
and and stuff like fosdem like fully

254
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:16,079
open source

255
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:17,040
uh no major uh interests by by any by

256
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,839
any companies like

257
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,480
a community thing feel free to talk to

258
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:22,800
us

259
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:24,800
we are actively trying to reach out and

260
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:28,640
and try and

261
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:30,000
spread this to other places

262
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:33,600
that's it and i hope you have a good

263
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,600
heart i hope you have a few questions

270
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:01,200
uh we have a sale at info desk k every

271
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:03,279
year

272
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,560
i don't know if that's the exact time so

273
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:05,920
if you want one next year

274
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,839
like for this year they're already gone

275
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:10,399
but for next year um

276
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:12,079
be at the info desk early-ish on

277
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:15,120
saturday and just ask when

278
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:18,079
when that sale is and

279
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:19,360
yeah basically that's it yeah for this

280
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:20,719
year it's too late like they've gone

281
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:23,200
super fast because it's like

282
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:26,560
40 laptops or 30 for i don't know how

283
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,560
many thousand attendees so yeah

284
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,560
hi um thank you for all the great work

285
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:33,600
is there any data on

286
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:36,800
how much the nat 64 is being used uh

287
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:39,519
do we see more native ipv6 data and is

288
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:43,040
that somehow related to the drop in

289
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:43,279
proportional drop in uh in cpu usage for

290
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,319
the

291
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:48,720
for the not six volts no uh so

292
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,959
um so first to answer the second

293
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,880
question first uh we ran bind

294
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:54,399
during this weekend and we switched over

295
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,560
during this weekend

296
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:58,320
so we could compare directly so these

297
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:59,839
are actual directly

298
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,720
numbers which directly relate to each

299
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:04,560
other as to the first question

300
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,839
we have two networks one is dual stack

301
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:10,079
one it is completely

302
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:13,760
ipv6 with net six four and then s64

303
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:15,599
most of the traffic we see is ipv6 only

304
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:17,200
that's already the case since last year

305
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,800
i actually dropped that slide because

306
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,560
it's been the same for the last two

307
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:24,079
years that we are basically

308
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:27,040
ipv6 has more or less one um the major

309
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:27,920
ipv4 usage we see is mainly vpns which

310
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:30,800
we

311
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:32,240
think are stuck on either literal octets

312
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:35,359
in the configuration

313
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:37,839
or old versions of openvpn or something

314
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:40,480
which just didn't support ipv6 but most

315
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:44,240
traffic these days is ipv6 except

316
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,240
for what we think is vpn traffic

317
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:49,040
yeah so do you also lock the video

318
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,920
streams i mean a couple of years ago

319
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,719
there was a lot of

320
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,360
talk about oh if it was on youtube it

321
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,079
was

322
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,519
a flash it was property adobe and you're

323
00:11:56,079 --> 00:12:00,399
also streaming in web

324
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:01,279
m so which is open source is there any

325
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:04,880
difference or

326
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:07,040
doesn't user care today uh you mean

327
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:11,839
the content of the people who who make

328
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:11,839
the talks or i i yeah

329
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:23,360
yes ish we do but

330
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:25,920
not in a nicely integrated system

331
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,480
we are moving more and more stuff into

332
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,519
into

333
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:31,519
uh into our observability platform we

334
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:33,200
kind of have a split between video team

335
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:36,160
and infrastructure team

336
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:37,839
um so the video team is is independent

337
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:41,120
in what they do but they keep

338
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:43,600
adding more stuff to our observability

339
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,720
so we also have more insight into what's

340
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,800
actually happening

341
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,000
and all of that data is completely

342
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,760
public on uh

343
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,600
just a second oh yeah dashboard for some

344
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:54,560
org like everything we have

345
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,680
everything we use internally you can

346
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:59,680
just use

347
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:59,680
you can just see this literally the same

348
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:08,560
thing

349
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:09,600
so what exactly is the render farm used

350
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:12,638
for and

351
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:15,920
uh why not use a dare i say it at this

352
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:15,920
conference a cloud provider

353
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:20,320
so uh first question what the render

354
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:23,680
farm is used for um

355
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:24,399
transcoding video so we have the raw

356
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,000
video which

357
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:28,160
like the raw video comes in here you

358
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,480
have to stream from from this laptop

359
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:32,399
you have to stream from the camera both

360
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:35,440
are dumped on local disk here

361
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:36,399
and also they're streamed to to the

362
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:39,040
laptops

363
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:40,880
they transcode it they reduce the size

364
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:43,760
basically

365
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:46,079
transcode them for streaming and for

366
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:48,319
another disk dump

367
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:49,760
and why we're not using a cloud form

368
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:53,680
well we used

369
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:56,560
it i think 2014 or 15 we actually used

370
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:57,519
uh google cloud back then because we had

371
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,800
some issues and

372
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:00,880
that was quick because we had a few

373
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,639
people who could do this quickly

374
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,160
but we prefer to use open source

375
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:07,199
software and

376
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:09,120
most cloud stuff is not http lv3

377
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:12,240
which means it's not really fully open

378
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:14,560
source in in the actual intention of

379
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:16,560
open source at least under my or most of

380
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:19,359
us our interpretation

381
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,760
so we just prefer to do it locally also

382
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,680
if

383
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:23,279
ever our internet cuts out we have

384
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:24,560
everything local so at least the people

385
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:27,839
who are local could still

386
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:29,279
be watching some stuff so but the main

387
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:31,760
reason is ethical reasons

388
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:33,120
we don't want to to to export this to

389
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:35,199
somewhere else the only thing which we

390
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,490
really rely on is the grafana cloud

391
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:38,240
of course um

392
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:40,959
[Music]

393
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:42,399
people destroyed our instance in the

394
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:43,920
early days and that meant

395
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:47,199
we didn't have monitoring ourselves and

396
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:47,199
that kind of sucked so yeah

397
00:14:48,959 --> 00:15:02,560
anyone else

398
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:05,040
um any plans to further uh

399
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:06,319
disincentivate the use of uh for a

400
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:10,160
fosdem dual stack

401
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:13,600
instead of the main plan of the main

402
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:16,639
wi-fi acid because i was wondering if

403
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:19,279
if you kept for example the ssd stable

404
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:20,800
and people connect to it three years ago

405
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:21,279
and didn't change the laptop didn't

406
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,359
change

407
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:24,880
anything they will still connect to this

408
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:27,120
one

409
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:28,639
if you for example change from fosdem

410
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:31,360
dash legacy uh

411
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:31,920
to a stack to foster underscore stack

412
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,519
well

413
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:35,279
they will be forced to do this choice

414
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:40,079
again

415
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:42,720
yes ish we we used to call it legacy for

416
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:43,680
internal political reasons that got

417
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:46,800
changed to

418
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:48,880
um to to dual stack

419
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:50,639
we don't actually mind if someone is on

420
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,360
dual stack and i don't want to break

421
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:53,440
anyone's

422
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,880
anyone's connections so people are more

423
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:57,680
than welcome to use

424
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:59,120
dual stack the reason why we have ipv6

425
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:02,399
only on the main ssid

426
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:04,320
is this is a developer's conference so

427
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:05,839
we want to kind of little bit push

428
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:08,560
people towards

429
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:09,920
the ipv6 only uh because they tend to

430
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:13,199
fix stuff like we have

431
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:13,920
with a major distribution fix quite a

432
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:15,839
bit of things

433
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:17,040
once we just started sending all people

434
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:18,959
who had complaints

435
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:20,160
just to that booth and tell them okay

436
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:21,119
talk to your distribution because it's

437
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,600
their fault

438
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,720
like they fixed it really quickly but we

439
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,680
don't want to be too

440
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,680
pushy about it so

441
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:34,839
um thanks a lot richard for your talk

442
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:37,839
[Applause]

443
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:37,839
yep

444
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:45,279
you
