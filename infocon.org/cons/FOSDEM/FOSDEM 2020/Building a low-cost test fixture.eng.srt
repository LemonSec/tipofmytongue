1
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:10,320
so hello my name is

2
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,599
guillaume vieir i'm a software engineer

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,639
at chubby data

4
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:16,640
and today we'll be talking about testing

5
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:19,600
and more specifically how to build a

6
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,600
local science fiction

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,439
so just to go through the agenda i'll

8
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,920
start with some background how this

9
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:27,279
project

10
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:31,119
started what were the motivations why we

11
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:34,239
try to do this the architecture we chose

12
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:37,120
how we designed our test fixture

13
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:37,599
and then we look at the lessons learned

14
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,800
and

15
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:43,760
uh our conclusions so

16
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,959
db data it's a belgian company founded

17
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:47,920
in 2003

18
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:49,840
we're located in brussels and we

19
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,920
specialize in telematics and mobile

20
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,320
logistics solutions

21
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,199
and as part of this we provide we build

22
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,039
our own

23
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:58,559
tracking device so it's a battery power

24
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:59,840
tracking device

25
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:01,760
and here you've got a picture of the

26
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:04,400
latest generation

27
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,840
so it's uh two pcbs stacked on top of

28
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,640
each other

29
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:11,840
you've got four mounting holes a few

30
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:15,600
micro controllers some sensors

31
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:17,840
gps and a modem

32
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:20,080
and you've got a connector for the

33
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:23,439
battery and another connector that sees

34
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:27,039
for the debugging port

35
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:29,119
so last year we finished that design and

36
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,400
the next step is when you build a few

37
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:31,439
prototypes and you're happy with the

38
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,680
design

39
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:34,559
you have to go large scale and you have

40
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,759
to go to

41
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,520
manufacturing so we work with an

42
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:41,280
external company for that

43
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,560
we give them the fabrication the

44
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,960
manufacturing files

45
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,640
and they've got the entire assembly line

46
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:50,079
so they make the pcb

47
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:52,240
they solder the components they run some

48
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:54,960
optical inspection to check the solder

49
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:57,439
joints the placement of the components

50
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,559
and the last thing they need is a tool

51
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:00,240
from us

52
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,840
that can tell them whether a board is

53
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,399
good is valid

54
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,040
and they can deliver it to us or it's

55
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:07,040
broken

56
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,479
and it has to go to the bin because it's

57
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,120
beyond repair

58
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,800
or if there are some repairs that can be

59
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,280
done

60
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,879
so the way it works is it's fixture

61
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,680
where you put

62
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:20,560
the board you want to test and you load

63
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,480
the

64
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,239
firmware that's going to run the

65
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,679
self-tests try to communicate with all

66
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:28,400
the components

67
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,280
and give you results so the very first

68
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,800
test is

69
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:35,920
is the board booting is there any shorts

70
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:37,760
and then we have a report for all of the

71
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,920
components

72
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:41,920
and the last step is to program the

73
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:44,079
production firmware

74
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:46,238
so we've got two microcontrollers we

75
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,440
need to program them before they go to

76
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:49,120
the customer

77
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:51,040
we also need to write some

78
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:55,360
identification on the board

79
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:59,280
on some eprom so that's the final step

80
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:00,400
of that process our board it's quite

81
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,480
small it's

82
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,599
six centimeters by three centimeters

83
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,000
roughly

84
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:08,319
it's very densely crowded which means

85
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,560
that your test points are really small

86
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:12,079
they are 0.6 millimeter in diameter and

87
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,760
the minimum spacing

88
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:17,920
is 1.27 millimeter

89
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,040
so traditionally you would choose a

90
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:21,200
fixture like

91
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,959
the one you see on the left hand side

92
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:25,440
it's it's very sturdy

93
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:27,120
it's built for hundreds of thousands of

94
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:30,159
cycles

95
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:34,239
so you've got wide pegs where you can

96
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:34,239
locate your pcbs you want to test

97
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,000
on so on the bottom plate under the

98
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:41,330
bottom plate you've got

99
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,560
uh spro probes test probes with a spring

100
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:45,440
[Applause]

101
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,319
and you've got the lid and when you

102
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,720
close the lid

103
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:49,440
those probes will come up through the

104
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,640
plate

105
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:55,280
and make contact with the ball

106
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,760
so on that picture what's great is you

107
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,720
can

108
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:00,480
test multiple device at the same time on

109
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,359
that case you can do three at the same

110
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,920
time

111
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:05,200
the only thing is it's quite expensive

112
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,339
to build

113
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,640
and if you've got more

114
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:10,400
[Music]

115
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,920
if your targets you know your volume is

116
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:15,360
a bit more

117
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:18,560
more modest it's quite an investment

118
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:20,000
so we decided to start a project to look

119
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,839
into how we could build

120
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,199
something that does the same thing but

121
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:26,840
that is cheaper

122
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:28,000
that relies mostly on off-the-shelf

123
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:30,960
components

124
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,320
so if we've got three components to uh

125
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:35,120
to the system

126
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,759
um so the you've got the device in the

127
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,479
test

128
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:39,680
and you need to interface with that

129
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:42,560
device

130
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:44,720
so for for this we use the bed of nails

131
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:47,199
it's going to have the test probes

132
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,000
um they're going to there's going to be

133
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:50,639
a breakout

134
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,600
connector where the test controller can

135
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:54,960
connect

136
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:58,160
and talk to the board load some codes

137
00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:01,120
measure some voltage power its

138
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:02,000
power cycle if you need and the last

139
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,360
component

140
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,440
it's the flasher so it's the

141
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,960
the component that's going to write to

142
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,680
program your microcontrollers with the

143
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:13,599
production firmware

144
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,120
so there are if you look on the internet

145
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,280
you will find lots of

146
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:20,560
tutorials or other people with projects

147
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:22,119
on a bed of nails using poco pins

148
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,759
or you can see

149
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:29,120
[Music]

150
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:32,720
projects where they 3d printed a fixture

151
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:34,960
they are really good but they all use

152
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:37,039
probes that need a minimum spacing of

153
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,719
2.54 millimeter

154
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:40,159
which is twice bigger than what we've

155
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:43,840
got and

156
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:47,280
we can't really reproduce that so

157
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:49,679
we settled with designing a custom pcb

158
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,638
that will hold those test probes in

159
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,360
place

160
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:55,759
and help to locate the device over the

161
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,759
probes

162
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:01,039
for the test controller you could use a

163
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:03,360
microcontroller

164
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:04,639
we decided for raspberry pi zero because

165
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,039
it's a very

166
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:08,639
nice board to use it's very easy to

167
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:10,080
program a microcontroller you need

168
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,560
someone with experience

169
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:14,560
to write firmware uh use the peripherals

170
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:17,840
it takes more time to develop

171
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:20,960
so we found it's easier to develop

172
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:23,198
your codes on raspberry pi 0 and quicker

173
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,560
and for the flasher we settled on

174
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:27,280
openocd

175
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,759
so it's a library that helps you debug

176
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:31,679
or

177
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:31,680
flash any type of microcontroller

178
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:36,960
so now let's dig into the details how

179
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:40,319
the bed of nails so as i mentioned

180
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:43,680
before it's a custom pcb we designed

181
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:47,199
so we use four screws that will

182
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:49,680
help locate the device we want to test

183
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:50,800
in the first slide i showed you you

184
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,599
remember there are four

185
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:55,280
mounting holes so they will slot into

186
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:57,440
the screws

187
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:59,198
and the props will be able to make

188
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:03,840
contact with

189
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:05,840
the test points um

190
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:08,080
so before that i'm a software engineer i

191
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,359
had no experience with designing pcbs

192
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:13,758
before this

193
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:17,759
so it was a great opportunity to learn

194
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:22,080
and i decided to learn using keycards

195
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:24,000
so there are three steps to making a pcb

196
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,680
the first one well before this is to

197
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,400
decide what test points you want to use

198
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,479
we've got dozens on the board we don't

199
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:33,120
need all of them for the

200
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:34,080
test at the end of the production so you

201
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,120
have to select

202
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:38,318
the few units you start with the

203
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:41,919
schematics

204
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:45,280
so on the right hand side these are

205
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:48,240
the test points we want to connect to

206
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:49,280
on the device and on the left hand side

207
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,840
we just

208
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,878
route them to a bigger connector that

209
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:56,840
will be

210
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:59,599
easier to connect to the raspberry pi

211
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:02,318
zero

212
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:03,360
the second step is to associate

213
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:04,960
footprints

214
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,879
to each of the components you want to

215
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:09,680
use on your pcb

216
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:10,960
so for the the connector it's quite easy

217
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:14,080
there are standard

218
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:18,000
footprint we chose a standard male

219
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:21,520
header with 2.54 millimeter spacing

220
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:25,520
the problem comes for the pros

221
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:27,039
you have to define your own footprint

222
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:29,840
there are quite a few constraints to

223
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:31,680
expect the first one is

224
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,199
depending on the manufacturer you choose

225
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,719
to build your pcb

226
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,120
they've got different requirements

227
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:39,919
different classes of bills

228
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:42,399
with the price that varies so we tried

229
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:44,800
to stick to the standard class

230
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:47,120
and they defined a part-to-part spacing

231
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:50,160
and the minimum annular ring size

232
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,160
that you need to respect

233
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,000
the next two constraints they are

234
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,640
imposed by

235
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:00,640
uh the device you want to test so in our

236
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:03,519
case we saw that the spacing was 1.61.27

237
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:05,360
millimeters and the probe we chose they

238
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:08,640
have a diameter of

239
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:10,320
0.65 millimeter so

240
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,959
taking on into account all those

241
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:17,040
constraints we came up with

242
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:20,479
the dimensions of the pad so it's um

243
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:23,839
1.1 millimeter by 2 millimeter and 0.75

244
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,839
millimeter for the probe

245
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:31,279
then the final final step is to

246
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:33,519
place those components on the pcb you're

247
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:36,959
going to produce

248
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:40,480
so we decided on the silk screen to

249
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:43,599
draw the edge of the device in the test

250
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:47,600
so that the operator cannot be confused

251
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,600
on the position to put it in

252
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,480
then the very important point is to get

253
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:54,319
the test points coordinates right

254
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,519
you have to be sure that the coordinates

255
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:58,720
are the same

256
00:09:55,519 --> 00:10:01,200
when you take them on the pcb test

257
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,560
and on the one you're going to design

258
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,079
and for this there is a very nice

259
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,839
feature in keycard

260
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:08,479
you can set the origin points for the

261
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:10,640
grids any way you want

262
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:14,640
and then for each component you can

263
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:18,079
place it relative to this origin

264
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:20,399
so this is what the layout looks like so

265
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:22,319
at the top we've got two headers

266
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:24,320
this will have wires connected to the

267
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:28,160
test controller

268
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:29,360
we placed all the the footprints for the

269
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:32,560
probes

270
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:37,120
and we've got the four mounting holes

271
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:38,880
we made the pcb slightly larger than the

272
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:41,120
the size of the device on the test

273
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:43,839
purely for practical reason

274
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:45,200
it's easier to drop your comp to pcb and

275
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:47,839
remove it without pulling

276
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,839
everything together

277
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,800
so here's a picture of everything

278
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:55,839
assembled

279
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:56,560
so four screws for positioning the

280
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:59,680
probes

281
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:03,199
are soldered on the top pcb

282
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:03,760
and a nice thing to take into account in

283
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,680
your design

284
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:07,360
is the center of gravity of the board

285
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:09,760
you're going to test

286
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:11,040
in our case the probes are mostly

287
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:14,800
located on one side

288
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:16,959
so it was tilted when you dropped it

289
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:19,199
in place so we added a little bit of

290
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:19,199
foam

291
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:24,160
so the same assembly from the side the

292
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:27,439
the

293
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:28,800
bottom pcb helps

294
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:31,600
with the alignments and keeping the

295
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:33,120
probes vertical

296
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,600
and the probes as i mentioned before

297
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:39,120
they are soldered only on the top layer

298
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,120
where the connector is also soldered

299
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:45,439
so the next item it's the test

300
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:47,360
controller we picked a raspberry pi zero

301
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:50,399
board

302
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:51,200
we run tiny core on it it's a minimal

303
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:53,279
limited system

304
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:55,360
it's runs entirely from ram so it's

305
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:57,920
loaded that boot from

306
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,480
the flash card and nothing gets written

307
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,800
into it

308
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:02,240
unless you manually run commands too so

309
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:05,359
it's quite good if the

310
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:09,680
power cycle it it's gonna start in a

311
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:13,120
good in a good frame where

312
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:17,040
your setup is correct and

313
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:19,600
we wrote all the test scripts in python

314
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:20,719
and the raspberry pi communicates with

315
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:24,079
the board and the test

316
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:26,560
using the awards now

317
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:28,160
i mentioned before we want to measure

318
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:30,239
some voltages

319
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,199
and one drawback of using the pi 0 is

320
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:35,200
that you get no

321
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:38,240
analog inputs so we added

322
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:40,320
an attachment on top it's a

323
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:42,320
called the automation pichat it's built

324
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:44,320
by pmr pimoroni

325
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,160
and the good thing is they have a relay

326
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:49,040
that we can use to power

327
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:50,639
and power off the board that we test and

328
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,719
they've got three adc's

329
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:54,639
that we use to measure the voltages on

330
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:58,079
the board

331
00:12:54,639 --> 00:13:00,880
and the great thing is so this

332
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:01,519
this add-on comes with a python library

333
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,360
so you're

334
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:04,959
up and running in a few minutes it's

335
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,079
very well documented it's very easy to

336
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:09,839
use

337
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:12,560
it's very good now

338
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:14,880
for the last part the flasher i

339
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:16,638
mentioned we're going to use openocd

340
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:19,360
so we've got two microcontrollers on the

341
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:22,959
board that we need to flash

342
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:24,000
um we compiled openocd to run on

343
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:26,000
tinycore

344
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,079
and we need to add the gpio bitbank

345
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,720
support so you can use this to create

346
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:32,160
the

347
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:33,279
swda feature so it's just i added the

348
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:36,480
command

349
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:36,480
on how to build the library

350
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:41,760
it's running on piezo and

351
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,959
we defined the script for each of the

352
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:47,120
microcontrollers so

353
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:49,439
openocd has a lot of

354
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,199
scripts configured for each controller

355
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,839
the only thing you need to add

356
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:54,959
are the pins you're going to use on the

357
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:56,480
pi header

358
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:58,160
you need to set them up properly for the

359
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:03,839
sw the clock

360
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:03,839
and the i o and then you're good to go

361
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:11,199
so the conclusions of this project

362
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,839
is the cost comparison purely looking at

363
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:15,279
the hardware

364
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:17,279
not the effort to develop the software

365
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:20,240
initially we asked a few quotes to build

366
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:22,079
a standard test picture

367
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:24,240
from other companies that specialize in

368
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:27,040
this and we got numbers ranging from

369
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,040
3 to 6k

370
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,800
there are two additional parts they are

371
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:34,160
roughly in

372
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:35,519
400 so euro now if you look at the price

373
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:38,719
of

374
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:44,240
all the components we used all together

375
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:47,040
it's less than 100 euros

376
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:48,399
and uh the conclusions are so we managed

377
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:51,360
to build something that's cheap

378
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:53,040
and robust we've tested hundreds of

379
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:56,160
boards without any

380
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:58,240
mechanical problems the contacts are

381
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:00,079
made properly with the jute between the

382
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:02,240
props and the test points

383
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:03,839
it works quite well it's easy to build

384
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:07,120
and to replicate

385
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:08,160
if if the manufacturer needs to speed up

386
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,480
the testing

387
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:12,800
it's quite easy to build a new setup and

388
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:15,839
give it to him

389
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:16,719
now one limitation is it's well suited

390
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:19,600
to our needs

391
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:21,440
and our volume if you're trying to do

392
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:24,320
fancy things like

393
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:25,760
using rf probes it's going to be

394
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:27,600
difficult

395
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:30,399
whereas the standard test fixture

396
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:32,320
they've got props for anything you need

397
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:34,880
you can do vacuum testing you can do

398
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:36,560
pretty much anything you can have props

399
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:38,480
from the two sides from from the bottom

400
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:41,359
from the top

401
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,839
so the conclusion is it's good for our

402
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:45,120
needs

403
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:46,800
it might interest other people so we

404
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:51,040
thought it was a

405
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:53,599
nice idea to share how we made it

406
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:54,079
and to conclude here's a picture of the

407
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,959
full

408
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:57,519
assembly so on the left hand side we've

409
00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:00,239
got the

410
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:02,160
bed of nails we added the clamp on the

411
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:05,759
sides to maintain the dudes and

412
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:07,600
have enough pressure on the test probes

413
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:08,800
in the middle we've got the pi zero the

414
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:12,720
test controller and the

415
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:15,599
p hat they're all wired up to the

416
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:18,000
pair of nails and on the right hand side

417
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:20,720
we've got a raspberry pi

418
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,600
where we connect the pi zero into it and

419
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,360
so basically

420
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,360
the manufacturer just needs to plug a

421
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:27,279
keyboard and a screen

422
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,560
in the raspberry pi and he's good to go

423
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:31,140
he can test

424
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:33,359
all the boards and

425
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:36,000
[Music]

426
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:38,800
so that that's pretty much it if you've

427
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,800
got any questions

428
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:50,720
and why didn't you choose to to make a

429
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:52,880
hat directly for the

430
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,720
pie rather than a separate board from

431
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:57,519
using i mean you could have

432
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:58,480
put everything on the board plug to on

433
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:01,279
the pie

434
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,920
okay so that was we wonder about this

435
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:04,799
initially

436
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:06,559
one reason is that was my first pcb so i

437
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:08,799
tried to keep it simple

438
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:11,439
second reason is we wanted to do

439
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:14,720
ourselves as little as possible

440
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:16,559
and we found very quickly a hat that

441
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:19,760
does everything we need so why do it

442
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:22,319
again almost everything not the problem

443
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:23,760
not the not the probing itself no yes

444
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:25,359
the probing was really the only thing we

445
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:28,000
had to do ourselves

446
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:29,918
and have you estimated in the cost

447
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,600
comparison of costs the amount of time

448
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:34,240
you spent on the

449
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:35,280
design the so for the yeah there's the

450
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,120
price i mean you

451
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,960
you worked on the design and set up the

452
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,399
thing so it should be

453
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,840
when you compare the cost for the two

454
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,559
solutions yeah i agree there is a

455
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,639
missing line

456
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:48,000
i mean i agree no it's what's the

457
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:52,160
content is purely the cost of parts

458
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,160
the default involved was not discounted

459
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,400
but the effort to make the pcb to design

460
00:17:54,320 --> 00:18:01,840
the pcb it was

461
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:01,840
three to four days

462
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:16,880
hi uh thank you for your talk uh did it

463
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:20,159
help you to

464
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:23,360
detect a lot of um yeah

465
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:27,440
bad things in your pcb yes

466
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:28,639
again it does it's on the first batch of

467
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,960
production

468
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,480
there were components that the optical

469
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:35,360
inspection thoughts were

470
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:37,760
well placed but then when we ran them

471
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:40,559
through the test the test was failing

472
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:41,840
and we could see um even with your you

473
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:44,720
could see that

474
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:45,918
the the component was slightly skewed

475
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,120
and you could see the shoulder pads

476
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:48,960
under it

477
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:50,239
so it helped us to go back to the

478
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,160
manufacturer and say look

479
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,280
can we improve the the placement of the

480
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:55,200
components

481
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:56,480
and they reprogrammed the optical

482
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,559
inspection

483
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,760
and so we improved the yields batch over

484
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:10,799
batch using

485
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:14,000
that setup thank you

486
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:14,400
hello uh i have a question about does

487
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,919
this

488
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:21,840
uh fixture save the test results

489
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:25,039
somehow so you can check the deal or or

490
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:27,678
or how good is the production

491
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:28,559
if it's implemented in production and if

492
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:31,919
it's not

493
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:33,520
do you think it's possible to do that

494
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:35,120
so you're asking if the manufacturer can

495
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:38,160
do this without the fixture

496
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:39,039
no if imagine that you have this fixture

497
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:42,080
in a production

498
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:44,799
and then you have to check how good are

499
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:45,678
the unit under test that you are

500
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:47,360
checking

501
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:48,960
so you have to somehow um

502
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:52,399
[Music]

503
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:55,440
save the the measurement

504
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,799
or test results if it's possible to do

505
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:59,280
that

506
00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:00,639
to get like matrix test results for

507
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,639
power boards

508
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:04,080
for example the voltage measurements or

509
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:06,400
on the adc like is

510
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:08,639
not going to be the same in any unit

511
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:11,600
under there is going to be a tolerance

512
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:13,200
can you do you save that measurement

513
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:16,799
somehow and then you can

514
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:18,880
afterwards uh study the results so the

515
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:21,760
we don't save the results no there's the

516
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:23,440
range we account for the the accuracy of

517
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:25,200
the adc

518
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:27,200
so basically one thing is on the board

519
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:30,320
we've got different voltage rates

520
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,720
and there's one dc dc that you can you

521
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:33,039
can

522
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:34,000
set the voltage by solving a resistor or

523
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:35,840
not

524
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,200
so we mainly check that we've got the

525
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:40,559
right voltage that we soldered

526
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,559
the register in the right place

527
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:43,120
thank you

528
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:52,320
thanks for the talk um you said

529
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:53,600
this is a more interesting solution for

530
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:56,399
modest volumes

531
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:58,799
yes what kind of volumes should we think

532
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,799
about

533
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:07,280
it's roughly i'd say under 10 000

534
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:09,840
volts a year that's okay

535
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:11,600
above it would be worth investing maybe

536
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:13,678
in the more expensive solution

537
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:15,280
yes for one reason is that with the

538
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:17,120
expensive solution you can

539
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:20,000
test multiple boats at the same time

540
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:31,840
right so you stay from this time and

541
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:31,840
on the test cost thanks

542
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:36,960
um hi hi other question do you know the

543
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:40,240
uh

544
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:42,720
the wearing of uh the tester you know

545
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:45,120
how the frequency you have to change the

546
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:46,880
poker pins if they are broken or if they

547
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:48,639
don't make contact correctly

548
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:50,000
how many balls can you test without

549
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:53,039
replacing the

550
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,360
tester board so according to the data

551
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:56,080
sheet

552
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:57,520
they are rated for i think 100 000

553
00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:00,240
cycles

554
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:01,200
and so far we've tested over a thousand

555
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:03,440
boards with one

556
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:05,600
setup without needing to replace any of

557
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,600
them

558
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:13,120
okay i think that's all we have uh time

559
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:15,360
for now

560
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,639
uh no sorry we need to move on um but

561
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:19,840
thank you very much for that

562
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:21,850
uh super interesting talk so um

563
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:24,840
yeah round of applause please for the

564
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:27,840
[Applause]

565
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,840
presenter

566
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:37,760
you
