1
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:07,759
so

2
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:08,960
thank you all for coming out on a rainy

3
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:12,719
sunday morning

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:13,360
uh appreciate it so friday i was in

5
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:16,480
berlin

6
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:17,600
where mozilla was having it's twice a

7
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,800
year all hands

8
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,880
and i was thinking about this

9
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:24,320
presentation and

10
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:27,759
a question came to mind which is

11
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:30,800
how many at the median

12
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:34,399
tabs are open in a firefox

13
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:37,040
session now

14
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:38,559
there's the answer from twitter and i'm

15
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:42,160
going to ask y'all so

16
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:45,839
all right 20 or more tabs

17
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,839
are open put your hand up

18
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:55,520
okay all right if

19
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:59,839
10 to 20 tabs are open okay

20
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,840
10 or less

21
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:07,760
so i have a rule

22
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:09,360
do not think surprise

23
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,880
i'll take questions at the end because

24
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,200
we're compressed for time

25
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,479
uh do not feign surprise it's a rule

26
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,799
that's used by

27
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:22,080
uh uh by the uh whoops and

28
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:22,080
yeah okay thank you

29
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,400
i couldn't find my little slide

30
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:29,600
progressor thing so there

31
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:32,880
okay so

32
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,360
do not feign surprise so i'm going to

33
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:37,039
show you

34
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:39,200
what my reaction was when i asked a

35
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:42,960
member of our telemetry team

36
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,960
what the what the median was

37
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,479
two

38
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:53,920
at the median a

39
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,119
you have two tabs a person will have two

40
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,920
tabs open now

41
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:58,799
caveats on this um if you're using a

42
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,200
distribution

43
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,000
on linux like i'm that most of us in the

44
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,000
room are

45
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,759
uh you probably have telemetry stripped

46
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:11,360
out so this data is skewed towards our

47
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:11,360
and windows users

48
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:15,280
but anyhow what i'm here to talk about

49
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,920
is how do you ship

50
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,120
new features in a browser which people

51
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,920
want

52
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:25,120
serve diverse groups and do all of this

53
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,119
without being creepy

54
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:35,599
so what we had to do to think about this

55
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:36,000
what hold on like i said i'm not used to

56
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:38,480
having

57
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,360
i i couldn't find my little uh slide

58
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:44,480
advancer widget

59
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:50,160
so no i've got it okay come on

60
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:51,760
there we go and that just

61
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,760
today's been a thing today has been a

62
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:55,280
bit of a day okay anyhow

63
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,440
so what we had to do to do this is that

64
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,280
we had to replace our we had to replace

65
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:02,840
our process

66
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:05,840
uh thinking of this with one

67
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,840
that

68
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:11,599
sorry that was biased towards

69
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:13,760
our current our our old process was

70
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:17,119
biased towards people who were

71
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:20,159
had the time and energy and

72
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:22,239
privilege to be vocal with what they

73
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:24,079
wanted

74
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:27,280
so i'm going to talk about how we

75
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:30,480
changed how we thought about features

76
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,480
and how we changed it

77
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,480
and today i'm just talking about desktop

78
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:37,280
firefox

79
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:39,200
uh we're trying to do much more work on

80
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,879
mobile firefox

81
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,359
mobile of course is where the majority

82
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:44,959
of browsing is occurring these days

83
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,720
but we've learned a lot with desktop

84
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:48,720
firefox

85
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,920
so just a bit about myself i work at

86
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,239
mozilla

87
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:55,439
my title is bug master which is a fancy

88
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:57,599
term for engineering program manager

89
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:58,640
i work with the team that works on

90
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:00,798
bugzilla

91
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:02,079
that works on fabricator that works on

92
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:06,000
lando

93
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:08,560
i am primarily focused on policy

94
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
process and understanding how we handle

95
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:15,120
bugs

96
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:18,320
um i love coffee and i love ice hockey

97
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,320
so let's talk about features

98
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:22,799
so there's lots of sources for features

99
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,840
one source of course is our standards

100
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,479
process

101
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:28,400
people are making updates to javascript

102
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:31,520
we're making updates to hg

103
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:32,880
to html and all and all these processes

104
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:36,400
going through w3c

105
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,400
so that's one source of features

106
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,120
the past is also is that we get features

107
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:45,759
from talking to users so people

108
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:47,840
using firefox and we have a ux team

109
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:51,360
we also have the ability for people to

110
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:54,479
request enhancements

111
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:57,040
one of our volunteers kohei

112
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:58,240
put in this great feature last year that

113
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,520
allowed us to determine

114
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:04,720
uh mark bugs's task in bugzilla

115
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:10,719
features or actual defects

116
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:15,919
so we get enhancement requests

117
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:17,919
now bugzilla has votes

118
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:21,359
and in the past it's been used as a way

119
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:21,359
for people to prioritize work

120
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,880
the problem with boats is it's a rotten

121
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,240
way to prioritize

122
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,000
and i'm going to go back to louis

123
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,639
vuitton villa you may have seen him

124
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,919
yesterday

125
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:37,199
at the track on libre

126
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:38,400
and uh in law but back in the day on the

127
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:40,960
gnome list

128
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,679
he mentioned that votes end up having no

129
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:45,198
bearing

130
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,199
on an actual bug validity

131
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:51,758
its importance or its severity

132
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:53,280
so a lot of people could vote for a bug

133
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:54,000
but it only affects a small number of

134
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:57,359
users

135
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,360
or just one distribution

136
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,919
whereas there could be a bug that has no

137
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:05,520
votes

138
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:06,960
but it's broken all of our users

139
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:09,520
like what happened last summer with

140
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,520
add-ons

141
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:14,638
so the problem is it's like you use

142
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:17,198
firefox you use add-ons

143
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:18,720
you don't know where to go to say

144
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:20,639
add-ons are broken

145
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,720
i can't load them i get the certificate

146
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:24,560
error what the heck is going on

147
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,400
fine but we know that that's a high

148
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:35,280
severity issue

149
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:38,400
we all lost a lot of sleep that weekend

150
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:41,919
so how many of y'all familiar with uh

151
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:44,159
hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy okay

152
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:45,120
so you know this story this is something

153
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,440
that cory a

154
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,919
photograph that corey dr al took uh i

155
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:51,199
believe university college london

156
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:52,479
so you remember at the beginning of the

157
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,000
story is basically there's this guy

158
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:57,440
named arthur dent who has this

159
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,880
friend named ford prefect um who is very

160
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:01,440
strange because he's named after

161
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:03,199
carr that was sold in england in the

162
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:06,960
1970s and 80s

163
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:08,240
and they wakes up one morning and finds

164
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,799
out the earth has been scheduled for

165
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,800
demolition

166
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,000
and he goes and asks well why what what

167
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,479
we didn't know about

168
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,800
this she didn't tell us about scheduling

169
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:24,000
to destroy the earth for a hyperspace

170
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:26,000
bypass and

171
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,599
the aliens who are running the uh who

172
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,720
are running the demolition fleet say

173
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:30,719
look dude

174
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:33,360
we had a notice up it was an alpha

175
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,360
centauri

176
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,479
you just could have just gone over to

177
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:37,599
alpha centauri gone to the basement of

178
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:40,719
the office

179
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:42,960
and found the demolition permit at the

180
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:45,919
same time

181
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:47,198
arthur's house is about to be demolished

182
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:49,120
and he asked the guy

183
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,560
she's about to do it saying well dude it

184
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:54,639
was in the

185
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:57,680
uh it was in the uh it was in the

186
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:59,599
in the council office in the basement in

187
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:02,639
the room that said where the leopard

188
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:06,319
so long story short

189
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:08,080
is people

190
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:10,400
are not in the same places where we make

191
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:12,560
decisions

192
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:16,080
and this causes concern this causes uh

193
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:17,360
this causes worry and stress

194
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,840
and a lot of the time privilege

195
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:22,639
determines this so privilege can be

196
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:24,159
here is just i know what bugzilla is i

197
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:25,680
know how to log into bugzilla

198
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,840
i know how to read a news group i know

199
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,919
how to read a mailing list

200
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,758
list you know these are things that we

201
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:35,120
as developers take for granted

202
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:35,120
but everyday users don't

203
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,200
so you have to know where do you find

204
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:40,399
the discussion where do you have do you

205
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,919
have time to be involved in that

206
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:44,959
discussion

207
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:46,480
um think about the other question that

208
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:49,359
people brought up is like get

209
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,880
should github be your resume and github

210
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,399
is your resume it means that you have

211
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,200
all this time to work on projects in

212
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,480
github

213
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,120
but you could be a perfectly fine

214
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:59,360
developer raising two kids at home

215
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,959
with no time to work on side projects

216
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,880
and nobody will know about you because

217
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:04,719
you don't have a github repository that

218
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,080
shows you working on all these cool open

219
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,240
projects

220
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,200
so if you enter the discussion will you

221
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,560
be heard

222
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,360
and also if you enter the discussion

223
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,359
will you be harmed

224
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:18,319
uh a few years ago i was working at

225
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:21,439
linden lab linden lab open sourced

226
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:23,760
the second life web client

227
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,800
or excuse me a second life cl second

228
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:27,920
life client

229
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:29,920
uh notoriously difficult to build

230
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:31,279
and a person on the open source mailing

231
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,959
list emails saying

232
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:34,560
what can we do to clean this up what can

233
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:37,199
we do to make it easier for people new

234
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:39,040
to the project to build

235
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,720
second the second life viewer and a

236
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:44,160
person immediately came in and said

237
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:45,839
how dare you what what i

238
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:49,199
suffered through this why should anybody

239
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:49,200
else have an easier time of it

240
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:54,000
and so that that's what i mean by asking

241
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,959
a question and not getting harmed not

242
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,720
getting yelled at

243
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:58,399
i want to point out some work that uh

244
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,000
dylan uh

245
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:01,440
did in the audience he used to work on

246
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,480
bugzilla for us

247
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:06,399
he's now over at fastly and um

248
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:08,399
he did a lot of work to make it easier

249
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:11,279
to build bugzilla

250
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:12,720
you can run it in a container so that's

251
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:19,600
the sort of thing that we want to do

252
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:22,880
so sorry to embarrass you john okay

253
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:24,480
so working on time so infrastructure

254
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:27,040
so let's talk about infrastructure for

255
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:31,279
making uh for deploying changes

256
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:32,959
so firefox ships on three release trains

257
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:34,800
last year it was six weeks now we're

258
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:36,479
doing it every four weeks there's a new

259
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:39,680
firefox coming out on

260
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:41,920
tuesday so i'm going to be very busy on

261
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:44,399
a train between here in paris

262
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:46,319
on monday trying to figure out making

263
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:48,320
sure that every all the switches are set

264
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:51,200
for release

265
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:53,360
so we have a nightly world feature where

266
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,279
new features land

267
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,880
beta goes through uh goes through that

268
00:10:55,279 --> 00:11:00,720
and then it goes out on

269
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:02,880
on release

270
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,000
a lot of the time we've used online a

271
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,320
lot of the time we use

272
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,680
preferences which you've seen and about

273
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,920
profs

274
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:11,519
to manage that so here we go so we land

275
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,800
a feature on night link

276
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:15,839
it goes on the beta it goes on the

277
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,839
release boom

278
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,959
it crashes and release remember we're

279
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:21,600
releasing across

280
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:23,518
all kinds of combinations of operating

281
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:27,680
systems and hardware

282
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:29,600
uh my friend charity majors talks about

283
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:31,199
you're always shipping or you're always

284
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,000
testing and release whether you want to

285
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,800
or not

286
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,399
so what happened when we did this well

287
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:39,120
normally what happens then is we have to

288
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:41,440
spin up a new release

289
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,240
and that's expensive to spin up a new

290
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,240
release

291
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:46,160
we have to back out the change we have

292
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:48,560
to test the back out

293
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:50,079
out then we have to get it to users and

294
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:56,160
there's no guarantee the users will pick

295
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:58,239
it up

296
00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:01,519
so anytime again you send a relations

297
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,519
you are testing in production

298
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,839
so we talked about experiments at

299
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:11,839
mozilla

300
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:11,839
has a way of getting around this

301
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:15,920
and our first thing was using this thing

302
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:17,839
called test pilot

303
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:20,000
so test pilot was using the add-ons

304
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:21,440
mechanism to try out new features in

305
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,279
firefox

306
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:28,800
so again this is great it's opt in

307
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:30,959
uh if you want to try it

308
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,319
however you have to know what add-ons

309
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:33,760
are

310
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,839
you have to know how to install an

311
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,720
add-on you have to understand that an

312
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:39,760
add-on

313
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:42,800
changes the user interface of firefox

314
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:47,120
before you use it in order to use it

315
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:50,959
so we ended up picking up

316
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:52,720
a bias sample of users this way

317
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:54,638
so we're picking up people who know

318
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:57,680
firefox essentially people

319
00:12:54,639 --> 00:13:02,240
kind of like us maybe not developers

320
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:04,638
but still experts thank you

321
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,360
so again you have to know about it we're

322
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,800
the leopard

323
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,480
so we have to change how we think about

324
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:10,959
features

325
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,959
so this is a sticker by laura thompson

326
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:16,000
who now runs our browser

327
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:17,839
futures research at mozilla

328
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,760
and she referred to experiments as

329
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:22,639
cupcakes

330
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:24,240
so cupcakes you know you can make a

331
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:26,079
whole bunch of cupcakes and then you can

332
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,920
experiment with toppings and fillings

333
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:29,519
and frostings

334
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,839
because you don't want to make a

335
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:32,720
chocolate cake and then do an anchovy

336
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:34,880
frosting

337
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,480
and throw away a whole cake it's just

338
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,160
better to throw out the one cupcake and

339
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,920
then try the next one with you know

340
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:42,399
chocolate frosting instead of anchovy

341
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,399
frosting

342
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:48,079
then we also grew our product team

343
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,160
so we actually have people taking

344
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:51,359
ownership of these of making decisions

345
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,880
about the browser

346
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:55,120
about the future of the browser about

347
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:56,399
features

348
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,160
and then we have a data science

349
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:01,360
organization

350
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:02,880
now when you bring in a data science

351
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:05,199
organization people get immediately

352
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:07,040
start asking questions about telemetry

353
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:10,880
and data from the users

354
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:14,000
um i'm going to defer you to

355
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:16,240
our data collection principles and this

356
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,839
guides all the work that we do

357
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,519
because we know we need to understand

358
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:21,839
how people are using the browser but we

359
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:25,760
also cannot

360
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:25,760
abuse that trust

361
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,160
and then we have to change our tooling

362
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:32,000
and ship code

363
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,680
so remember when we said that we had

364
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,680
things like turning on feature

365
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:37,279
turning on features with preferences and

366
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:41,040
the only way i could update the

367
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:41,040
preferences this was to ship a point

368
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:47,040
release

369
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:49,120
what if and i'm going to use a d and d

370
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:50,959
metaphor here

371
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,800
what if your browser is walking down the

372
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:53,439
hall of the dungeon and you've got your

373
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,519
sword

374
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:57,360
and you got your torch and you got your

375
00:14:55,519 --> 00:15:01,279
thief and you got your wizard

376
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:03,760
and you got your tank and you come along

377
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:07,040
and then instead of a wandering monster

378
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:07,040
there's a wandering feature

379
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:13,760
and the referees ask hey you come across

380
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:17,120
a wandering feature

381
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:19,680
roll on the encounter table so you roll

382
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,680
the dice

383
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:27,040
so what we do now is we say instead of

384
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:28,719
are you a thief are you a rogue are you

385
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,599
a wizard are you a cleric are you a

386
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,800
paladin

387
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:36,079
we say are you linux are you windows

388
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:38,160
are you mac are you

389
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:39,680
in english language reason are you in

390
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:42,319
the eu

391
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:44,079
you do you have a co-processor do you

392
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,800
have a gpu

393
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:48,800
you and that tells us what table to roll

394
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:54,079
on

395
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:57,279
and then we'll turn on the preference

396
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:58,079
so what we're doing is every few hours

397
00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:01,120
your browser

398
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:03,359
if it's enabled will go back and ask hey

399
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,880
referee are there any wandering features

400
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,240
on the encounter table for me to roll

401
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,240
against

402
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:10,240
and it says yes roll on this table and

403
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,120
you roll it rolls to die randomly and

404
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:14,639
says

405
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:18,079
says okay um i rolled six okay

406
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:19,759
you get the feature so notice that we

407
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:22,959
don't have to keep track

408
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:24,880
of who of who you are

409
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:26,319
we just simply probabilistically assign

410
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:29,680
you to features

411
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:33,759
as we're going along on so we

412
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:36,160
uh so we uh so we apply the preference

413
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:36,959
so most of this is mainly being done for

414
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:40,000
ui

415
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:41,279
features uh features because it's pretty

416
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,800
easy to turn this stuff

417
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:47,839
on and off at the feature level

418
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:50,560
uh at the uh to turn off you uh turn on

419
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:52,480
on on and off javascript uh we're

420
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,920
figuring out how to do this for features

421
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:56,959
that are in rest in c

422
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:57,759
plus because normally what we have to do

423
00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:00,560
now

424
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:02,240
is turn on uh we have we have to restart

425
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:05,520
your browser to do it

426
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:08,880
so what does this enable you to do so

427
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:10,160
i can get 90 of my target audience i can

428
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:14,160
deploy a feature in

429
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:16,160
in 72 hours hours if you can talk to our

430
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:18,400
survey uh to our preferences server

431
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:20,319
which we call normandy you get the

432
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,520
update you don't have to wait until you

433
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:22,720
know

434
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,720
you don't have to wait for a point

435
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:26,799
release release

436
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,760
rolling back means all i have to do

437
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:30,000
instead of

438
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:31,280
backing out code and retesting and

439
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,640
responding all this stuff

440
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:34,639
is i just turn off the feature

441
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:40,480
and most importantly we are sending

442
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:44,000
rules

443
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:47,120
not code it is very scary to send

444
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:50,240
code to a browser

445
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:51,280
because if your code server sending code

446
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:54,480
gets

447
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:55,760
hacked then i have poisoned my entire

448
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,600
user population

449
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:59,280
so i'd just much rather send a

450
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:03,520
preference

451
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:06,080
so we also do some stuff around safety

452
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:07,679
okay uh preference server and client are

453
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:10,000
designed to fail safely

454
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:10,880
and then major releases always uh

455
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,080
restore

456
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:17,919
restore uh safe defaults

457
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:19,439
so we do consistent prop flipping again

458
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:22,080
from what i described with the library

459
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:25,280
we call uh that that was developed by

460
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:28,960
another one of our engineers years

461
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:31,120
we have a tooling site for it called

462
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:33,840
experimenter that we use for managing

463
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:36,559
experimental preflips as well as uh

464
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:40,879
production prep flips

465
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:42,720
so we did firefox monitor last year

466
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:44,559
which we did in cooperation with have i

467
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:47,440
been pwned

468
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:48,240
honed this enabled us to really quickly

469
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,080
turn on this

470
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:52,880
uh turn on this feature first select few

471
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:54,399
people understand how it was working

472
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:57,840
and then decide okay we'll go ahead and

473
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,840
roll it out to a broader audience

474
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:04,240
and again for this to work for for

475
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:06,240
uh firefox monitor work all you have to

476
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:08,160
know is what site they're looking at

477
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,760
so we just basically look at a you know

478
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,000
there's a there's a reference table we

479
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:13,200
look

480
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,080
at at to anonymize this so we can just

481
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,160
say hey

482
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:17,360
you're on xkcd the forums have been

483
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,919
hacked make sure you update your

484
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,918
password

485
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:27,520
and then

486
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,840
the product process behind this is you

487
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,520
know

488
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:31,439
just going through saying which of these

489
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,960
features you want and people said hey we

490
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:35,600
want to be notified about

491
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:37,360
site releases so then we constructed an

492
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:42,159
apparent an experiment to see hey

493
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:42,159
will this work okay three minutes okay

494
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:47,600
so doing this experimentally enabled us

495
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,640
to get half a million people

496
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:53,840
or uh worth 600 000 people nearly in the

497
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,840
united states to try this out

498
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:59,760
so summing up what we had to do is

499
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:01,678
recognize the biases that our product

500
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:03,440
had remember when i asked you again the

501
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:04,640
first question is how many tabs do you

502
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,559
have open

503
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:08,159
and it turns out it's much less than you

504
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:10,480
think it is

505
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:13,120
yes start with the information that you

506
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:14,960
have start with what we had

507
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:17,199
make it easy to update the product make

508
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:21,840
it easy to fix and make the easy

509
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:21,840
process easy to follow

510
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:26,000
and again tatiana mack is a great

511
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,919
designer and developer

512
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,320
pointed out trust your users live

513
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:34,960
experiences over your own presumptions

514
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:38,240
so that that's why as much as we want to

515
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:39,679
put all this cool stuff in for tabs

516
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:42,320
there's other problems that we need to

517
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:45,600
work on to help our users

518
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:48,158
and remember in firefox um

519
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:49,760
we have the add-ons mechanism so that

520
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:51,760
gives us a great place for people to do

521
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:52,400
those customizations to support power

522
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,679
users

523
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,440
because if you end up supporting your

524
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:57,039
power users you end up leaving the rest

525
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,720
of your user base behind

526
00:20:57,039 --> 00:21:00,480
you don't want to just lock out your

527
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:03,600
power users and say no

528
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:06,320
i'm not helping you but what you can do

529
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:09,120
is create a mechanism that does that so

530
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:10,559
that's why we have addonsmozilla.org

531
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:13,199
or i don't know if anybody from the

532
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:16,559
add-ons team is speaking this afternoon

533
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:17,840
okay but yeah so you can't data science

534
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:19,440
your way to supporting

535
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:21,360
diverse groups of users alone you do

536
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:23,280
have to talk to people

537
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:25,360
you do have to advocate for users

538
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:27,840
preferably diversity reflecting your

539
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:31,439
users so that just means not just

540
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:33,760
disability it's language its background

541
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:35,520
all of these things and then you know

542
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:37,120
and asking the users from those diverse

543
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:39,200
backgrounds the questions

544
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:41,439
and then validate and then validate your

545
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,440
work

546
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:48,158

548

questions like

551
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:58,080
there's no problem we're going to take

552
00:21:55,200 --> 00:22:06,720
five minutes to take questions

553
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:06,720
