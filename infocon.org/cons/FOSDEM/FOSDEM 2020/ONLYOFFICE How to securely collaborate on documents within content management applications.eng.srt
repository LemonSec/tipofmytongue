1
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:13,610
so hello everyone my name is Alex I'm

2
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:17,299
from professional services at on the

3
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:19,720
office and today I would like to share

4
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:24,860
with you our experience in building

5
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:28,040
connectors connectors that allow to edit

6
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:31,040
and collaborate on the documents within

7
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:34,070
any content management applications so

8
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:37,820
first briefly I will try to explain you

9
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:41,870
what is on the office and what we do on

10
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:44,149
the office is a powerful solution for

11
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:50,269
editing your documents your spreadsheets

12
00:00:44,149 --> 00:00:53,929
and your presentations office open XML

13
00:00:50,269 --> 00:00:57,230
has been chosen as a co-op format to

14
00:00:53,929 --> 00:00:59,530
ensure compatibility with almost 90% of

15
00:00:57,230 --> 00:01:03,019
all existing documents in the world and

16
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:08,870
to avoid any issues by converting the

17
00:01:03,019 --> 00:01:12,890
files only office can be deployed on any

18
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:17,950
any platform so we have a single engine

19
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:21,110
for web for desktop and fare for mobile

20
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:24,310
applications so and that guarantees

21
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:27,430
seamless switch from offline to online

22
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:31,220
and vice versa

23
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:34,700
we selected JavaScript as one of the

24
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:38,660
most universal languages so we use note

25
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:40,940
8's on the server-side and what's very

26
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:44,119
important on the office is already

27
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:49,490
integrated in more than 20 well-known

28
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:54,140
platforms and in more than 100 web

29
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:56,750
services worldwide on the office is

30
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:59,240
available as different packages so as

31
00:01:56,750 --> 00:02:02,860
dr. container snap Universal server

32
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:05,419
cloud on Amazon limits and many others

33
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:08,470
and of course our source code is

34
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:14,230
available on github

35
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:16,100
now why only office our first task is to

36
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:20,299
create

37
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:23,359
very very powerful engine for processing

38
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:24,860
the documents and here you can see the

39
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:30,380
list of the points which are very

40
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:33,250
important for our team only office

41
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:37,460
provides comprehensive tool set

42
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:40,000
organized in a tabbed interface so here

43
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:44,960
you are able to use different features

44
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:48,230
like standard features table of contents

45
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:51,160
content controls bookmarks and many many

46
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:55,630
other features and what's very important

47
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:55,630
javascript allows you to enhance

48
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:06,740
additional features to the editors using

49
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:10,850
our API and our plugins only office

50
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:14,960
plugins are applications that allow to

51
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:17,840
add some functionality to only office

52
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:20,990
editors we divide all plugins in the

53
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:24,650
visual that just add some buttons maybe

54
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:27,830
some menus to the interface then non

55
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:29,420
visual plugins that open some dialogue

56
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:33,740
some context menu

57
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:38,390
we do have system plugins that just

58
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:40,550
works in the background we have non

59
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:42,890
system plugins that can be started by

60
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:45,340
clicking on a button and of course we

61
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:49,359
have all le objects that allow you to

62
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:53,620
insert some information into the

63
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:58,280
document itself we already have few

64
00:03:53,620 --> 00:04:01,670
plugins and our users are using these

65
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:05,720
plugins to translate texts to use

66
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:08,600
services like citation generations to

67
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:11,300
use web chats like telegram in the

68
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:13,519
document editors interface to use

69
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:16,910
reference services like Mandalay and

70
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:21,079
Zotero and many many other features are

71
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:23,680
supported when you use our API so right

72
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:28,609
now different developers worldwide are

73
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:35,789
experimenting with our API using

74
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:41,300
plugins only office editors are based on

75
00:04:35,789 --> 00:04:48,169
html5 canvas and that has had lots of

76
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:50,879
advantages so html5 canvas uses its own

77
00:04:48,169 --> 00:04:53,639
internal tools for rendering the

78
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:58,289
document so every single element can be

79
00:04:53,639 --> 00:05:02,069
rendered down to the last pixel and that

80
00:04:58,289 --> 00:05:08,719
allows to use only office in any browser

81
00:05:02,069 --> 00:05:12,659
on any device it's very important and

82
00:05:08,719 --> 00:05:16,949
what's also very important and that's

83
00:05:12,659 --> 00:05:19,289
one of our key points our client-side

84
00:05:16,949 --> 00:05:23,279
performance talking about client-side

85
00:05:19,289 --> 00:05:26,279
performance we talked about advanced

86
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:28,949
sharing permissions there are few

87
00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:32,250
standard sharing permissions like view

88
00:05:28,949 --> 00:05:35,639
or edit but we also do support

89
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:39,779
additional like commenting like filling

90
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:44,000
forms like track changes like modifying

91
00:05:39,779 --> 00:05:46,800
filter and of course of course

92
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,529
restricting downloading and printing is

93
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:52,830
also available but you may say ok we

94
00:05:49,529 --> 00:05:55,789
were able to use that feature in any any

95
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:58,889
web editor but when we talk about

96
00:05:55,789 --> 00:06:02,610
advanced permissions we also talk about

97
00:05:58,889 --> 00:06:05,819
core editing so for example here you can

98
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:09,300
see a document and three different

99
00:06:05,819 --> 00:06:13,039
persons these three persons are working

100
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:17,520
on the same document the first is

101
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:20,759
editing that table the second one is

102
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:25,049
using track changes mode and the third

103
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:28,740
one just adding some commands to the

104
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:29,240
document but what is the most important

105
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:32,969
thing

106
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:36,839
nobody is disturbed here and that's only

107
00:06:32,969 --> 00:06:39,248
possible when we move the processing to

108
00:06:36,839 --> 00:06:43,559
the client side

109
00:06:39,249 --> 00:06:46,629
one more example a simple action like

110
00:06:43,559 --> 00:06:50,889
undo your last move can be a very hard

111
00:06:46,629 --> 00:06:54,069
job if you work in co-editing mode so

112
00:06:50,889 --> 00:06:56,529
only office allows you to use undo

113
00:06:54,069 --> 00:07:00,239
feature without affecting your

114
00:06:56,529 --> 00:07:04,808
co-authors on the office has its own

115
00:07:00,239 --> 00:07:06,969
lists of the actions mapped to every

116
00:07:04,809 --> 00:07:10,269
user in the document so you are able to

117
00:07:06,969 --> 00:07:15,429
use your undo without affecting any any

118
00:07:10,269 --> 00:07:18,819
other users so and now about security

119
00:07:15,429 --> 00:07:23,438
that's crucial question for everyone who

120
00:07:18,819 --> 00:07:26,860
works on the documents online what we

121
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:29,649
did on the server side we use JSON web

122
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:32,949
token so we are able to sign or requests

123
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:37,419
between storage storage document server

124
00:07:32,949 --> 00:07:40,959
and your client we also have additional

125
00:07:37,419 --> 00:07:44,709
features for configuring the cache of

126
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:50,079
the server and we also guarantee that no

127
00:07:44,709 --> 00:07:51,969
user data is stored on the server we

128
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:55,360
also do support additional security

129
00:07:51,969 --> 00:07:57,308
features like watermarking like secure

130
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:00,159
phone feeling that's when for example

131
00:07:57,309 --> 00:08:03,489
you have access to some area in the

132
00:08:00,159 --> 00:08:09,789
document and nobody else has the taxes

133
00:08:03,489 --> 00:08:12,729
so we also have end-to-end decryption in

134
00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:16,899
our desktop editors when working with

135
00:08:12,729 --> 00:08:20,969
our only office portals now a little bit

136
00:08:16,899 --> 00:08:23,349
about performance if you need let's say

137
00:08:20,969 --> 00:08:25,989
1,000 simultaneous connections

138
00:08:23,349 --> 00:08:31,089
you only need a single server with 8

139
00:08:25,989 --> 00:08:33,698
cores and 32 gigs of memory just because

140
00:08:31,089 --> 00:08:37,719
you need your server only when opening a

141
00:08:33,698 --> 00:08:39,758
document and when closing it that's all

142
00:08:37,719 --> 00:08:44,949
between these two points you don't need

143
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:49,540
your server anymore and more if you need

144
00:08:44,949 --> 00:08:51,910
more power so you are able to run only

145
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:52,540
office cluster with all dependencies in

146
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:59,259
a

147
00:08:52,540 --> 00:09:01,360
tributed manor we have our open API that

148
00:08:59,259 --> 00:09:04,839
allows you to add some additional

149
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:07,240
features or to integrate our editors

150
00:09:04,839 --> 00:09:11,940
into almost any document management

151
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:14,769
system for example the first one

152
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:18,130
document builder document builder is a

153
00:09:14,769 --> 00:09:21,160
core of document editors you are able to

154
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:23,230
create documents using javascript you

155
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:27,819
are able to convert your documents to

156
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:30,730
any other formats so it's a PDF so you

157
00:09:27,819 --> 00:09:35,729
are able to create your documents from

158
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:39,670
your database using some templates and

159
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:42,610
my favorite portion you are able to add

160
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:46,719
different features to only office

161
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:49,990
editors basing on your use cases on your

162
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:52,810
experience for example if you need to

163
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:54,940
mention some user in your document

164
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:59,439
editor so you are able to do the

165
00:09:54,940 --> 00:10:02,310
following document editors will connect

166
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:05,800
to your database will request the list

167
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:09,000
with all users in your database so then

168
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:12,310
you are able to select every single user

169
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,680
then our our editors will inform your

170
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:16,599
system and you will notify user that he

171
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:22,239
was mentioned so that's all you need to

172
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:27,399
do next one content controls that's one

173
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:33,250
of the most important plugins I think 3

174
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:36,189
out of 10 developers use that plugin I

175
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:39,130
will try to to make a small example how

176
00:10:36,189 --> 00:10:41,110
it works so let's say you work on a

177
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:44,589
document the document is stored

178
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:47,949
somewhere in your cloud maybe on your

179
00:10:44,589 --> 00:10:51,759
server in your storage but the document

180
00:10:47,949 --> 00:10:54,939
has an area that area called content

181
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:57,130
control takes the data from another

182
00:10:54,939 --> 00:11:00,310
storage from your private database or

183
00:10:57,130 --> 00:11:02,350
some other storage and what's the most

184
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:06,279
important thing you met you may not even

185
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:08,589
have access to remove or to edit that

186
00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:11,829
interns control and even more you're

187
00:11:08,589 --> 00:11:15,189
able to share the document with anyone

188
00:11:11,829 --> 00:11:19,529
who won't be able to see the content of

189
00:11:15,189 --> 00:11:25,420
that area so that's one of the most

190
00:11:19,529 --> 00:11:27,939
simplest features once again there are

191
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:31,269
lots of features available when using

192
00:11:27,939 --> 00:11:34,300
our API version history just left panel

193
00:11:31,269 --> 00:11:36,100
with all actions all actions and here we

194
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:41,229
don't talk about track changes now just

195
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:44,110
usual editing you just need to save some

196
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:46,779
metadata to your storage when you save a

197
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:50,769
new document then when opening the

198
00:11:46,779 --> 00:11:53,620
document you take that metadata file and

199
00:11:50,769 --> 00:11:59,860
open it that's all you need to do to

200
00:11:53,620 --> 00:12:03,160
display that version history panel one

201
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:06,639
more thing using drag-and-drop you are

202
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:09,699
able to work with different iframes

203
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:11,860
within a single HTML page and you are

204
00:12:09,699 --> 00:12:14,589
able to use drag-and-drop to move some

205
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:16,959
information from you for example chat to

206
00:12:14,589 --> 00:12:18,970
the document editors interface for

207
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:22,329
example when you work with Firefox

208
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:25,000
that's okay but chrome doesn't allow to

209
00:12:22,329 --> 00:12:27,959
move such information so what we did we

210
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:30,610
just created a small plugin called

211
00:12:27,959 --> 00:12:34,149
external listener that allows you to

212
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:41,800
catch the information direct from your

213
00:12:34,149 --> 00:12:43,959
chat so our online editors have

214
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:47,859
beautiful API that allow you to

215
00:12:43,959 --> 00:12:51,758
integrate into almost any any document

216
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:54,910
management systems we already created

217
00:12:51,759 --> 00:12:59,050
few connectors for next cloud on cloud

218
00:12:54,910 --> 00:13:02,290
sharepoint alfresco and confluence new

219
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:05,670
connectors for harm hub Liferay just

220
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:08,889
created but the most important thing

221
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:13,029
there are lots of developers who created

222
00:13:08,889 --> 00:13:16,269
their own connectors guys from xwiki see

223
00:13:13,029 --> 00:13:19,240
file video exit platform they created

224
00:13:16,269 --> 00:13:21,510
their own connectors for on the office

225
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:25,300
desktop edit

226
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:31,060
now briefly explain how it looks like

227
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:33,459
using connector with next cloud you need

228
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:35,229
to create some kind of global settings

229
00:13:33,459 --> 00:13:37,779
and user settings when creating a

230
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:41,940
connector to only office so you may

231
00:13:37,779 --> 00:13:45,660
create server settings using

232
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:49,209
configuration of your server but we did

233
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:50,649
admin menu for next cloud and here you

234
00:13:49,209 --> 00:13:52,630
just see few fields

235
00:13:50,649 --> 00:13:55,480
the first one is document editing

236
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:59,139
service address just address of the only

237
00:13:55,480 --> 00:14:01,660
office document server one thing that

238
00:13:59,139 --> 00:14:04,029
server should be accessible from next

239
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:08,500
cloud storage and from your client and

240
00:14:04,029 --> 00:14:11,019
of course next cloud storage is also

241
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:14,019
available for document server for

242
00:14:11,019 --> 00:14:19,870
downloading the files then secret key

243
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:21,880
very impossible very important field you

244
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:28,269
are able to sign all requests as I said

245
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:31,240
so using that secret key then if you are

246
00:14:28,269 --> 00:14:34,269
going to use only office and next cloud

247
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:36,760
on a single server so you need to use

248
00:14:34,269 --> 00:14:39,640
advanced server settings only if you use

249
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:40,680
next cloud and on the office on a single

250
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:44,740
server

251
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:48,430
what about user settings we have few

252
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:52,180
additional options you can configure so

253
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:54,479
some user parameters like restricting

254
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:58,089
access to editors to certain groups in

255
00:14:54,480 --> 00:15:01,089
next cloud then you can setup default

256
00:14:58,089 --> 00:15:04,240
files default formats that will be

257
00:15:01,089 --> 00:15:06,940
opened with only office editors you also

258
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:11,649
are able to customize your interface for

259
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:14,230
example to compact toolbar and you also

260
00:15:11,649 --> 00:15:17,680
are able here to enable watermarking if

261
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:20,709
that's necessary of course you need to

262
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:23,760
create some context menus so we did it

263
00:15:20,709 --> 00:15:27,609
for next cloud here you can see two

264
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:31,880
additional buttons were created for next

265
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:34,490
cloud we already

266
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:38,180
did some features for next Cloudant we

267
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:43,730
have plans to add additional features

268
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:47,439
for example we already created very

269
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:50,300
interesting integration point

270
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:52,670
integration with right menu of next

271
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:56,630
cloud here you are able to use next

272
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:59,839
cloud sharing dialogues maybe to

273
00:15:56,630 --> 00:16:02,450
integrate our editors with next cloud

274
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:07,880
applications like video chat or maybe

275
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:11,860
for next cloud talk something else so

276
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:15,130
and we have many many other plans how to

277
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:20,810
add different additional features to

278
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:24,260
integration we have our roadmap and in

279
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:26,989
that roadmap there are the tasks like

280
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:32,060
creating new industry-specific

281
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:34,910
connectors but as well we are trying to

282
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:38,329
add additional features like using Volpe

283
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:40,939
protocol like locking the file while

284
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:45,410
editing that's very important when using

285
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:49,970
next cloud integration so that's that's

286
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:54,469
one of the of the many many features

287
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:57,500
that we are going to do so and of course

288
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:59,570
if you have any questions if you would

289
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:01,340
like to contribute if you would like to

290
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:04,670
send some pull requests some issues

291
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:06,190
you're welcome thanks a lot for your

292
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:13,839
attention

293
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:13,839
[Applause]

294
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:28,160
the question was how many developers we

295
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:32,090
have so right now we have about 20 maybe

296
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:45,740
25 guys who are working on the editors

297
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:48,350
the question was if ODF formats are

298
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:53,330
supported yes of course of course we do

299
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:56,090
support office open XML as well as all

300
00:17:53,330 --> 00:18:01,129
their formats so all the T files are

301
00:17:56,090 --> 00:18:04,159
supported we we do support almost all

302
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:08,200
document formats that we have so the

303
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:11,390
question is when we work with our

304
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:15,590
editors we need to convert these files

305
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:18,200
to office open XML standard then edit it

306
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:31,129
and then if necessary to save it back

307
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:34,670
converting to ODT for example so the

308
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:36,410
question was when we are going to

309
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:38,840
release a new version with pivot tables

310
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:44,180
yeah we are going to release it very

311
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:50,300
soon yeah just I guess a question of few

312
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:53,180
weeks we have few fewer release

313
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:59,590
candidates with that feature and our

314
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:59,590
quality assurance team is working on it

315
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:10,490
yes you're absolutely right right now we

316
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:12,980
do support viewing yeah but we do not

317
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:16,020
support editing as I said just question

318
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:18,750
of few weeks we are going to release it

319
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:20,340
question on support in this so I saw

320
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:22,590
that you when you are in a spreadsheet

321
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:37,129
you can take a chart you can copy it and

322
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:40,230
you can put it in now the question was

323
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:43,410
when we are going to support external

324
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:46,110
links for elements like charts and like

325
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:50,940
tables yeah for all the objects so

326
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:53,699
that's very good question we are working

327
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:58,530
on the question right now right now we

328
00:19:53,700 --> 00:20:02,310
plan to find some workaround and that's

329
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:06,000
that's really hard to realize cause yeah

330
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:09,540
cause we do support our own olá objects

331
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:12,600
yeah but we plan to do that we know that

332
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:16,159
that's very interesting and that's very

333
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:16,159
required feature yeah

334
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:30,800
the question was how we deal with user

335
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:33,409
interface changes when working with

336
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:37,550
different modes like mobile web and

337
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:43,070
desktop as I said we have a single

338
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:48,129
engine and we have talking about desktop

339
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:52,060
editors we have chromium so framework

340
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:57,860
that allows us to work with desktop as

341
00:20:52,060 --> 00:21:02,000
if you work with web browser so almost

342
00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:04,250
the same for mobile versions so but here

343
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:07,460
we need to adopt of course mobile

344
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:12,590
versions for compact displaying the

345
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:17,950
menus but we don't see any any critical

346
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:17,949
troubles here so we do it you may try

347
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:35,168
any more questions thank you

348
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:35,169
