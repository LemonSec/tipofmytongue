1
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:07,600
my

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:08,639
slsr from the beginning my name is deb

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,480
goodkin i'm the

4
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:12,639
executive director of the freebsd

5
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:15,679
foundation and i'm here

6
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:16,480
to represent the freebsc project and i

7
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:19,199
talked about

8
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,400
freebsd and it's it's sort of similar to

9
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,960
benny's talk

10
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,560
introduction of freebsd but i also try

11
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,960
to incorporate

12
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:28,640
things for people who are already

13
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,840
involved in the community too

14
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,558
and so so if you are a contributor

15
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,399
already

16
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:35,760
some things might be new some things

17
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:39,520
might you already

18
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:42,079
know so i i try to make it so

19
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:44,559
it was uh informative and welcome

20
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:47,520
welcoming talk to um

21
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:49,360
people from all areas and the talk that

22
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,760
i'm giving now is a talk i typically

23
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,280
give

24
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:55,039
to people at like linux conferences and

25
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:58,160
other open source conferences

26
00:00:55,039 --> 00:01:01,359
around the world so

27
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:03,440
we will get started here so my goal

28
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:06,000
today is to show the long history

29
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:07,520
and i know benny um so actually i'm sort

30
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,439
of assuming a lot of people in here

31
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:13,520
um was here for the previous talk but

32
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:15,679
i but also i know a lot of people laugh

33
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,080
so there's probably a lot of new people

34
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,920
in here

35
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,240
so first i want to start before i go

36
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:24,720
over the goals of my talk is to find out

37
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:26,880
so who is new to bsd in general

38
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,400
so good that's a good number so that's

39
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:33,199
awesome and who

40
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:35,680
and um and who in here uses linux

41
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,119
okay so almost everyone in here raised

42
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:40,720
their hand

43
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:44,320
so so that's okay so my goal here is to

44
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:45,039
um is to share um information and our

45
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:48,079
history

46
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:50,079
about freebsd in particular and i'm

47
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:51,919
going to talk about why people use it

48
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:54,880
what freebsd is

49
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,520
and why you should use it and maybe

50
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,079
hopefully

51
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:00,079
contribute to our project and then

52
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:03,600
lastly i'm going to highlight

53
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:05,279
what we as the foundation and project

54
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,960
what we've been doing around the world

55
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:10,479
and in

56
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,478
advocating for the project

57
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,319
so i'll start with free what is freebsd

58
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,640
since there's a lot of people in here

59
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:19,040
who are new to the bsds

60
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:21,279
and um and so i assume that's also

61
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:27,440
previously

62
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:29,360
so so i put i use this slide

63
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,280
and not to be mean to tux because i

64
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:34,239
think tux is really cute

65
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,800
and um but it's really a lot of people

66
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:37,280
um

67
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,879
do you still think that free bc is a

68
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,120
linux distribution

69
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:43,440
and so i use this to make a point that

70
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:46,000
that it's not it's totally separate now

71
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,640
and and it came from a different place

72
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,760
and so

73
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:53,920
i'm going to highlight that but i

74
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:56,239
want to share those slides here too

75
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,799
right and this is recent i mean this was

76
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:00,480
i think

77
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:02,159
opensource.com which is uh it's

78
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:05,280
basically a

79
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:08,560
website that's hosted by red hat and

80
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:11,840
uh and they were doing this poll and um

81
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:13,599
and so this is another reason why people

82
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:16,400
get confused that

83
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:17,280
you know i mean if i were new to unix

84
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,159
and linux

85
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,920
and you know any of any of the unix-like

86
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:23,440
type of operating systems i would just

87
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,640
think that freebsd was another

88
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:27,599
distribution

89
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,879
and so what's that i know i wonder well

90
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:30,720
we could probably find out

91
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:32,079
and so and i did read in the comments

92
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,319
too on here that

93
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,280
one of the reasons why they did this it

94
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:37,760
was because

95
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,280
they wanted to include freebsd but what

96
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,079
they really should have done was what's

97
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,640
your favorite

98
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,840
unix-like operating system and i think

99
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,000
that would have been

100
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,040
better for at least for us well and i

101
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,159
think for

102
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,440
for people in the world so freebsd i

103
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:53,920
look at freebsd

104
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:55,040
the previously world as three different

105
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,439
components

106
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,319
and so on on the top there you have the

107
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:01,200
actual

108
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:01,679
open or the open source operating system

109
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,879
it's

110
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,319
the binary that you download off the

111
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:07,439
freebsd.org website onto your computer

112
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:09,359
and you run it

113
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:10,959
the middle one there is the actual

114
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,239
project and there are some people here

115
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,480
from the community

116
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:16,239
but the project is made up of thousands

117
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,478
of contributors

118
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:19,839
and then the last one is the foundation

119
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:24,400
and that's what i run

120
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:25,119
and represent and um and we are a 501c3

121
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,320
which is

122
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:30,720
us it's a

123
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,639
designation within our government and

124
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,720
how we file taxes and what it means

125
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:37,440
basically is we're a public charity

126
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,320
and we are for the public good and so

127
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,000
our whole focus

128
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:42,080
is to support the project and the

129
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,680
community so we're not a trade

130
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,199
association which is what the linux

131
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,320
foundation is

132
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:49,360
we're actually here for the community

133
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:53,280
for the project

134
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:55,600
and and to support them so it is freebsd

135
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,320
i mean it's when the oldest largest most

136
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,880
successful

137
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:00,240
open source projects in the world and

138
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,360
we've been around we'll be celebrating

139
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,639
our 27th

140
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:06,800
anniversary in june and it's a complete

141
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:10,479
operating system so when you think of

142
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:12,080
so i so i will compare previously with

143
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:13,520
with linux just because that's what most

144
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,120
people are familiar with

145
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:17,440
but linux when you talk about linux it's

146
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,600
the kernel and so then you have

147
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,880
all all these distributions that's why

148
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,000
you have this whole list of

149
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,919
distributions

150
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,680
and that puts the whole operating system

151
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:26,639
together so when you're running your

152
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,560
computer

153
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:29,919
you're not just running linux you have

154
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,080
to have that whole

155
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:33,919
uh user and lend the tools documentation

156
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,280
all that kind of stuff so freebsd is all

157
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:38,240
of that this is very

158
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:39,758
cohesive coherent operating system we

159
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,280
support over 33

160
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:43,039
actually i think the number the number

161
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:45,359
increases every day

162
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:46,960
we may be at 35 000 third-party uh

163
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,880
packages which really means that when

164
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,719
you're using it as your desktop and

165
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:53,360
you want to access the internet you

166
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,639
could have a browser that you can

167
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,360
install in a

168
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:59,280
word processor and whatever software

169
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:02,400
that you want to use

170
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:03,919
almost anything is supported

171
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,239
like i said we have over a thousand

172
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:10,000
contributors or thousands we have

173
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:13,120
uh 400 between 400 and 500

174
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,319
active source committers and we run on

175
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,800
many platforms

176
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:17,360
and and so it's hardware as well as as

177
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,639
cloud

178
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:23,520
platforms and uh and there's millions of

179
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:26,400
deployments out there

180
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:28,719
so i saw this from uh uh someone from

181
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:30,880
netflix gave a talk last year at the

182
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,840
main track actually it was really good

183
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,719
and um and so i actually stole his

184
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:37,039
abridged uh

185
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,639
version of where freebsd came from

186
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:40,318
because i really liked it but i added

187
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:43,199
nice graphics to mine

188
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:45,199
and uh but it's really a tnt unix

189
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:48,639
started in 1969

190
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:49,360
and um and so you may have you may be

191
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:51,520
familiar

192
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,840
with the anniversary that was celebrated

193
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:57,680
i think it was last november

194
00:06:53,840 --> 00:07:00,880
in um new jersey where unix was created

195
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:04,240
and then the bsd started um

196
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:06,960
from that it was a t

197
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,160
actually if you heard warren erlash's

198
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:11,120
talk yesterday

199
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,639
um or if you didn't i would recommend

200
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:15,039
watching the video

201
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:17,120
of it he gave a talk in the main track

202
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:20,240
on the early enx's

203
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:22,720
it was really interesting so

204
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,759
so that's available as well as i believe

205
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,599
mad dog

206
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:27,440
john hall is giving a talk a keynote

207
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:30,159
later today on

208
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:32,560
he's like the google of unix and

209
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,880
computing he's pretty he's amazing

210
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,919
so uh so i would recommend both both

211
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,319
those talks

212
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:39,440
and uh but the bsd is berkeley software

213
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:43,280
distribution

214
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:45,280
and um and so so unix was licensed to a

215
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,840
few universities and berkeley was one of

216
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,840
them

217
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,280
they come came up with berkeley unix

218
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,960
it's also referred to

219
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,400
berkeley software distribution or

220
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:55,120
berkeley research

221
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:57,120
unix there's various names of it and and

222
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,680
that's where a team of people actually

223
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,680
worked on

224
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:06,319
improving it and and it became the

225
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:06,319
platform for freebsd and netbsd

226
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:13,198
and so this is a little visual

227
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,319
of the timeline see if i can get it to

228
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:16,720
play

229
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:18,720
where so i just talked about how enx

230
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:22,160
started in 69

231
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:24,479
and then um you know the c language

232
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,680
was developed there to make it more

233
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:29,758
portable

234
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:32,959
and and then different versions of these

235
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:34,800
bsd some of the research and features

236
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:37,838
that were added

237
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:40,319
to it i'm not going to go over each one

238
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:42,640
because for me really what i care about

239
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:44,720
is in 1993 freebsd

240
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:47,120
starting and that's also when that bsc

241
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,120
started

242
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,760
so let's see if i can stop this but we

243
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,680
have a great timeline on our

244
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:56,080
website and when i say our website it's

245
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:59,680
the freebsdfoundation.org

246
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:01,760
website and it was it was fun to put

247
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:03,839
together

248
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:05,760
so let me start again because i just

249
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:10,880
let's see here

250
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:10,880
i'd show from here yeah

251
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:19,600
what's happened wait here we go yeah

252
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:21,359
a little technical difficulty here um

253
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,720
so it's starting there and i believe i

254
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,920
need to go here

255
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:27,600
so i know this is

256
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:29,920
actually this is nice because everyone's

257
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,600
pretty close on so i like to use this

258
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:34,880
because it really shows

259
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:37,519
the lineage of freebsd it shows

260
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:39,519
unix at the top and how it branched into

261
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:41,920
a lot of proprietary closed source

262
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:43,040
type of operating systems i mean when i

263
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:46,000
graduated

264
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:47,519
college which was a few years ago i used

265
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,200
ibm aix

266
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:52,640
and so it was sort of in the prehistoric

267
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,800
days and

268
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:57,279
um and we and so that's what we used at

269
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,839
ibm and it was actually before pcs came

270
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:00,480
out

271
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:02,560
yeah but hp had their version and

272
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,800
various companies like those large

273
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,839
corporations they had their version of

274
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,399
unix

275
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:09,519
and but if you see if you look here on

276
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:12,079
your left

277
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:13,920
and so here i zoom in a little bit more

278
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:16,319
so what i'm trying to show here

279
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:18,479
is the lineage of freebsd and how it

280
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:21,680
descended from the berkeley unix

281
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:24,959
which descended from the original unix

282
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:27,599
that was developed by ken thompson in 69

283
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:28,719
and and then i included i have an arrow

284
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:32,000
there

285
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:33,839
on the left of of linux and how

286
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,640
i mean it didn't just magically appear

287
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:40,160
but he did base it on he didn't model it

288
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:44,000
after unix but um but it

289
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:45,920
didn't descend from that from that

290
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,079
years of development and when you look

291
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:51,760
at the people who

292
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:53,359
worked on bsd at berkeley they were

293
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:55,360
they were university students they were

294
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:58,560
mostly phd students

295
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:59,920
some of the people bill joy if you don't

296
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,439
know who he is i mean he's one of the

297
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:04,479
co-founders of sun

298
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:07,440
and he oversaw the bsd project

299
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:08,800
and so you had um these years of

300
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,720
development at berkeley

301
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,880
of these college students so if their

302
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,959
phd students are probably

303
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,240
like in their early 20s and so then when

304
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:19,599
freebsd

305
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:21,600
started a decade later then you

306
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:24,160
actually we still had a lot of those

307
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,959
people continuing to support and develop

308
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,519
on it

309
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:30,160
so the difference in age when you look

310
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:33,760
at when linux started versus when

311
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:36,560
freebsd continued or started that you

312
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:39,920
actually had 10 years difference in

313
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:41,680
the age of the developers and so you had

314
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:43,839
sort of a more mature group of people

315
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:45,199
who were developing that

316
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:46,640
and you could look at that in you know

317
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,279
two different ways you could say well it

318
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,600
was young

319
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:50,720
and you know maybe it's more innovative

320
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,160
it's but it's

321
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,160
you know but i'm just trying to

322
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:56,719
highlight what the differences were

323
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:58,319
in the um the people who are part of

324
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:01,680
that

325
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,720
so who uses freebsd so i mean when i

326
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,439
tell people

327
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,800
that yeah you're probably using freebsd

328
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,320
they're always surprised because

329
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:11,279
a lot most people haven't heard of

330
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:13,279
freebsd before but what i did here

331
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:14,399
these aren't the only companies that use

332
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:16,959
freebsd

333
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:19,200
what we try to do is choose marquee

334
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:22,638
companies or recognizable companies that

335
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:24,800
you're familiar with that use freebsd

336
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:26,320
so most likely you use freebsd i mean if

337
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:29,359
you have an iphone

338
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:30,639
uh you know mac os and ios were

339
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:33,680
developed from

340
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:36,000
freebsd they still follow for the

341
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:37,680
the command line they actually come to

342
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,560
our conferences still

343
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:41,279
netflix is a big known company that uses

344
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,760
freebsd

345
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:45,279
for the high performance they they get

346
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:49,120
on the streaming so

347
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:51,439
when you're watching a netflix video

348
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,160
you know tv show whatever that's all

349
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:55,440
streaming

350
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:58,160
on freebsd servers trivago

351
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:01,200
the playstation and i understand the 5.2

352
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:01,199
will be freebsd

353
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,639
so i won't go through all these bullets

354
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:09,599
but

355
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:10,240
but really you know the the main reason

356
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,360
why

357
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:15,040
people why users use previously and and

358
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,440
it will be different between like a

359
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:19,279
individual user like us in this room

360
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:21,839
versus like a corporation

361
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:22,720
a corporation like say sony's a good

362
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:25,600
example

363
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:28,079
why they may use freebies uh because of

364
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,040
licensing and so we do follow the bse

365
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:33,040
license

366
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:35,279
and so linux's gpl previously is bsd

367
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:36,719
and so it's a permissive license which

368
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:38,320
means you can take

369
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,839
the code and you can make your own

370
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,680
changes and you don't have to give it

371
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:43,360
back to the community and it's a

372
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:46,319
philosophy that

373
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:47,360
the community believes in that they are

374
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,839
happy

375
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:51,440
that someone else is using their code so

376
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:54,639
they don't feel the need that

377
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:56,320
they need to get recognition for it and

378
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:57,680
but there's also companies that use it

379
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,839
for the same reason but that

380
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:01,599
they actually upstream almost all their

381
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:03,839
changes so netflix actually

382
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,880
is a really good example of a company

383
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:06,880
that does that

384
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,160
and and i would highly recommend

385
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,880
watching uh

386
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:12,560
jonathan looney's talk from fosdem last

387
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:15,360
year it was in the main track

388
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:16,160
and he talked about how netflix follows

389
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,440
the

390
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:22,719
developer current branch of freebsd

391
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:24,880
and and how they successfully do that

392
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:26,880
so it was a really popular and well

393
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:28,959
received talk

394
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:31,279
and then just the fact that it's a

395
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:31,599
cohesive operating system and then just

396
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:34,079
this

397
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,720
history of development too is another

398
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:38,239
reason

399
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:41,760
why why people like to use freebsd

400
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:42,480
users like us then we'll use it because

401
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:45,199
of

402
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,920
um yes stability and reliability

403
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:48,639
actually that's why

404
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:49,599
companies will use it too but also for

405
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:51,839
the community

406
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,920
so we're also known as a very friendly

407
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:55,920
and welcoming community too

408
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:57,680
and the documentation we're known for

409
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,279
excellent documentation so

410
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,479
when you're installing freebsd and i'm

411
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:02,720
actually going through this process

412
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,880
right now so i have freebsd on here

413
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,320
i run it on a virtual machine and but i

414
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:08,480
also have another a new

415
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:10,800
laptop that i have at home so sitting

416
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:13,920
and waiting for me to install freebsd

417
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:17,920
and since i don't do this a lot

418
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:19,680
i can search for help on when i run into

419
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:22,240
issues there's also a really good

420
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:23,120
community that i can reach out to and

421
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:26,160
get questions

422
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:28,320
answered so how the project

423
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:30,000
works so first i'll start off with uh

424
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,199
since we descended from berkeley they

425
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,440
had a whole

426
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:34,959
model that they followed on development

427
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,759
since it was a

428
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:38,959
fairly large software development effort

429
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:41,279
on their part and how they

430
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:43,199
control everything and so we still

431
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:46,079
follow that model

432
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:48,399
and it's so so the first thing that i

433
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:50,638
include is just the fact that so

434
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:52,720
so i work for the freebsc foundation and

435
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:54,000
then we have the freebsd project and

436
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:57,199
actually in the next slide i think

437
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,600
i have a better um graphic of this but

438
00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:00,240
we

439
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:01,440
we are a separate organization so we

440
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,920
don't run

441
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,639
previously the project we can't tell

442
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:07,279
them

443
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:07,759
what to do or have any control our whole

444
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:10,079
purpose

445
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:11,440
is to support them and so if there's any

446
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:14,479
critical needs

447
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:15,920
any holes in the project then if we have

448
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:18,959
the funding we step in

449
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:19,599
and and help fill those needs we have a

450
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:21,040
core team

451
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,880
actually when the core team member is

452
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:26,959
he's not in this room right now but he's

453
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:28,399
we do have a free bsd table and uh

454
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:30,079
let's see what room oh one of the

455
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:33,440
buildings

456
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:36,160
in h i think okay

457
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:37,279
yeah so it's the main building where

458
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,959
when you go in and

459
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:40,800
and they had the files done t-shirts and

460
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:43,599
all that kind of stuff so we're there

461
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:44,000
and um and so bendick represents the

462
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,639
core

463
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,920
team and that's actually um elected

464
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:48,639
every two years we're coming out for

465
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:51,519
elections

466
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:53,680
and i believe may and anyone who's a

467
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:57,199
committer has a vote

468
00:16:53,680 --> 00:17:00,079
and um and then it's a mentoring system

469
00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:00,880
to get your commitment so if so for

470
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:03,120
example

471
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:04,720
i'm doing documentation and so i submit

472
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,799
patches for changes

473
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,799
and so eventually someone will recognize

474
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:11,359
that and then they'll offer me

475
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:13,280
a mentorship and then hopefully i'll get

476
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:14,559
my commitment that way

477
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:16,959
i just need a little more time to do

478
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:19,439
that and it's very collaborative

479
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:21,679
so this is my version of org chart for

480
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:24,640
the project so it's nothing official

481
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:26,400
and really didn't have room for all the

482
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:28,160
the functional teams but basically we

483
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,480
have these functional teams

484
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:31,600
and it's a great way to sort of organize

485
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:34,320
how things

486
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:36,080
are supported within the project and it

487
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:38,000
also allows people who

488
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,678
are interested in different areas to get

489
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,960
involved in those areas that they're

490
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:42,400
interested in so

491
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,160
say for example if you're interested in

492
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,880
security then you

493
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:48,320
and you have background then you can be

494
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:51,120
part of the security team we have

495
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:51,918
release and ports and so we have various

496
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:54,639
different

497
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:55,600
type of functional teams that make up

498
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,360
the project

499
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,959
and then the way i did it was sort of

500
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,320
you know a top-down approach where you

501
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:03,440
have the core team

502
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:04,960
and the core team is basically like i

503
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:07,679
view them as like the

504
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,559
the board of directors of the project

505
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:10,480
and so

506
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:11,600
they oversee it but they also don't have

507
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,919
control you can

508
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:15,600
i mean as a developer you can work on

509
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:18,160
what you're interested in working on

510
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:20,480
and that's philosophy of the project and

511
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:23,039
the core team steps in to help

512
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:24,320
with um you know sometimes it's

513
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:26,879
administration

514
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:28,720
and sometimes it's you know developer

515
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,000
relationships but they're sort of like

516
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:34,080
those managers that you

517
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,799
go to and so i just talked about the

518
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,840
core team

519
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:40,240
and and that's actually a list of

520
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:41,600
what what they work on and so what i'm

521
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,440
trying to point out here is that we

522
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,240
don't have one person who oversees the

523
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:47,039
whole project

524
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:48,080
and has the year or an a what goes in or

525
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:52,320
how things are run

526
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:52,320
so it is definitely democratically run

527
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:57,600
and i like to show this graph so we did

528
00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:00,240
this graph back in

529
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,879
so about a half a year ago and and what

530
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:04,080
i'm trying to

531
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:05,360
highlight here is the age distribution

532
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:07,760
of our and this is actually the

533
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:10,879
committers and not all the thousands of

534
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:14,400
contributors we have and

535
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:18,240
showing not only are we diverse as far

536
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:21,919
as countries and cultures represented

537
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:25,360
but also age so we are getting

538
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:27,200
new people involved in the project and

539
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:28,719
and probably more importantly getting

540
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,000
younger people involved too

541
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,760
because they're the ones who are going

542
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,440
to continue the one

543
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:36,559
the age near the end of that graph

544
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,480
a lot of those are actually people

545
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:41,678
who've been with the with previously

546
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:42,880
and bsd since the beginning which is

547
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:46,160
really

548
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:47,280
cool because we have new people who are

549
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:49,760
joining

550
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,639
and we love working with them and we

551
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,879
have these

552
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:55,120
older more experienced people who are

553
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:58,320
part of the project and know the history

554
00:19:55,120 --> 00:20:00,879
and and they're so welcoming that

555
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:02,158
they love talking to the younger people

556
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:04,159
and and helping them

557
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:06,799
along with the project and so it's

558
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:10,000
really neat to see

559
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:12,158
so how the releases work um

560
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,080
so it's basically the so we follow this

561
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:16,720
the principle of least astonishment

562
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:17,760
and it's basically things work don't

563
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:20,159
don't change them

564
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:21,360
and don't don't break things that

565
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:24,960
already work

566
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:27,760
and um and also across major releases

567
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:28,720
so when you when we have a new release

568
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:31,760
then

569
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:36,080
it's gonna you know i don't know

570
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:36,720
99 that you know confidence that it will

571
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:39,760
work that

572
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:42,480
you won't have to um back out

573
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:44,000
that um that update so we have two types

574
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:47,039
of releases major

575
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,240
and the uh point releases and so right

576
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:51,600
now where we're at

577
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:53,280
is the next major release will be 13.0

578
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:55,280
uh there isn't a schedule for that yet

579
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:57,120
but i i would guess

580
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:58,399
the end of the year early next year it's

581
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,840
every couple years

582
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:02,240
uh where there's a release schedule for

583
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:05,360
12.2

584
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:07,840
to come out and i believe 11.4

585
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,799
and and so we also have these sort of

586
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:11,360
policies

587
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:13,918
the rules of not breaking the avis and

588
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,918
apis

589
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,640
and then like i mentioned earlier with

590
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:21,120
netflix we have the

591
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,679
the two different uh branches and so we

592
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,678
call

593
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:26,000
current also referred to as a developer

594
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:28,320
branch and then the stable branch

595
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,360
and so like so for example on my

596
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,360
computer that i'm

597
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:32,879
installing for bsd i'm actually using

598
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:34,799
the current branch so it's the latest

599
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:37,520
and greatest version of freebsd

600
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:39,679
and what what we do is we we as a

601
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:41,760
project provide what's called a snapshot

602
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:42,720
and so every week those are run and so

603
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:46,720
that's the image

604
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:49,120
that all i downloaded on my system

605
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:50,480
but if you're you know if you but if you

606
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:52,080
want a more stable

607
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,760
not the development branch then we have

608
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:55,280
the stable branch too that a lot of

609
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:57,039
people use so like if i

610
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:59,280
if we do we hold workshops at

611
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:01,679
universities and in various places

612
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:04,480
and and we'll always use the stable

613
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:06,240
branch for that

614
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:08,720
so how you can or how you contribute to

615
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:11,600
the project there's very

616
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:14,240
many ways you can contribute like i said

617
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:17,840
i write documentation

618
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:18,960
i don't write code throw my background

619
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,799
so my background

620
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:22,559
isn't operating systems even though i've

621
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:23,440
been working with them now for almost 15

622
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:25,120
years

623
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:27,039
i'm trying to learn as much as i can but

624
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:28,719
my background is i was a firmware

625
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:29,600
engineer for many years for storage

626
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,679
devices

627
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,959
which is so different than operating

628
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:36,080
systems so

629
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:38,320
that's why i i could get back into

630
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:39,360
writing code but i choose not to and i'm

631
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:41,120
doing because i'm

632
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,799
already running in the foundation so it

633
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:44,000
would be difficult

634
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:46,559
but it's easy to get started

635
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:49,280
contributing and some of the suggestions

636
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:49,840
that we have would be one would be is

637
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:52,399
work on

638
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:54,480
documentation so you could translate or

639
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:56,880
improve the documentation

640
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:58,480
um you could there's many ports like i

641
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,400
was saying there's over 33

642
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:02,480
000 and so we always need ports

643
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:04,159
maintainers

644
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:06,240
and uh you could just go through the

645
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:07,679
peerless and and pick a

646
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:11,520
you know a problem out there that you

647
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:11,520
can fix and submit a patch for

648
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:17,520
and so yes so earlier i talked about why

649
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:18,320
people or why users use freebc this is a

650
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:22,480
list of

651
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:25,200
why companies will use freebsd

652
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:27,039
and um and really if someone asks me i

653
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:30,640
would say the two top reasons really

654
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:34,240
so the license and um and then cfs

655
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:38,480
and especially for uh data centers

656
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:40,400
uh people who really want that um

657
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:42,400
you know that reliability that they use

658
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:45,360
cfs and it's been supported in freebsd

659
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:47,679
for a very long time

660
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:48,959
and all these places where freebsd

661
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:51,039
stands out

662
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,480
and and the one thing that we don't have

663
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:54,799
on here that we are working on

664
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:56,320
is support on the laptop and so that's

665
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:57,200
always an issue especially with people

666
00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:00,720
like us

667
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,720
that we want um

668
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:04,710
wasn't sure if that was like a fire

669
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:07,279
alarm

670
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:10,080
[Laughter]

671
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:10,320
so um and that so that's an area that we

672
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,720
are

673
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:14,240
working on it's a hard area to support

674
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:16,720
because you have so

675
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:18,559
many different technologies and then you

676
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:22,000
get new one new generations

677
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:24,399
technology cpus and um

678
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,679
everything and so we're but we as a

679
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,720
foundation actually are working on

680
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:28,880
trying to support

681
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:31,120
some of the newer hardware so more

682
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:33,840
people can get freebsd running on their

683
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,840
laptops

684
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:37,678
i am highlighting some of the kernel

685
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,559
features here i'm not going to go

686
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:42,000
through each one

687
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:44,559
it's basically a list of the a typical

688
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:48,400
kernel that has to

689
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:49,440
work in this day the user one features

690
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:52,480
are more

691
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:55,919
um what what

692
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:56,240
i think sets us apart as far as making

693
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:59,360
it

694
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:02,000
a coherent system that our user land

695
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:02,879
is developed and tested and integrated

696
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,400
with the kernel

697
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:07,760
from our uh from our community so it's

698
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:10,880
one group of people

699
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:12,080
that are working on all of this and so

700
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:15,840
it's very consistent

701
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:15,840
coherent and integrated

702
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:19,520
some of the other features were known

703
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:22,799
about so like i said

704
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:24,240
zfs and uh and we're very active in the

705
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:26,480
opencfs

706
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:28,480
project d-trace which was brought over

707
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:31,520
from sun

708
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:34,559
back in i think it was about 2005.

709
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:36,799
it's a dynamic tracing tool

710
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:38,480
jails i mean we really came out with the

711
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:39,200
first containerization and actually

712
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:42,799
there are

713
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:45,120
projects that are working to um

714
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:46,320
you know product size that a little bit

715
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:48,000
better

716
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:50,399
beehive actually i just came from

717
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,159
australia for linux coffee u

718
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,919
and when the original beehive developers

719
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:55,600
gave a talk there and he's getting

720
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:57,520
involved in the project again it was

721
00:25:55,600 --> 00:26:01,120
originally developed for netapp

722
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:04,080
and then they open sourced it and so

723
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:06,719
so that's been a very successful feature

724
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:08,399
and the tcp were still used as reference

725
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,679
platform even though that was originally

726
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:12,720
developed in

727
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:17,200
bsd and capsicum actually is getting

728
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:18,880
um a little more um publicity

729
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,080
and it's very recent well they've been

730
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,200
working on this for years and it's

731
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:23,360
coming out of the university of

732
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:26,720
cambridge and they're working with arm

733
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:29,600
on a recently announced project that arm

734
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:33,360
is integrating the instruction set into

735
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:35,840
a version a cpu version that will be

736
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:37,279
on what's called the morella board and

737
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:41,199
they'll be very secure

738
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:43,600
and they have millions of

739
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,480
pounds funding for this project and

740
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,320
freebsd

741
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:48,400
has been working on this for i think

742
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:52,080
they've been working for five years

743
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:56,159
so it's very promising for

744
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:59,840
you know secure platform um

745
00:26:56,159 --> 00:27:02,559
maybe iot area and um

746
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:03,840
and but a great collaborative effort

747
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:06,879
with previously

748
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:08,639
and arm so

749
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:11,360
i'll talk a little bit about the freebsd

750
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:13,200
foundation so you understand who we are

751
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:14,479
and we are celebrating our 20th

752
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,400
anniversary

753
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:18,480
this year we're going to celebrate it

754
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:22,320
all year but we were founded

755
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:23,520
in march 2000 we are based in boulder

756
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:26,000
colorado

757
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:27,120
uh that's where that's where i am based

758
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,399
and

759
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:31,120
um but we are a distributed organization

760
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:34,320
we're very

761
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:37,039
we're very small i have i haven't

762
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:40,080
counted recently but i think i have six

763
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:41,279
to eight employees and we have interns

764
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:43,918
too so that's why

765
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:44,480
uh but we have an office up in canada

766
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:47,679
too

767
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:50,000
in the waterloo area and so we have a

768
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:52,799
lot of development going on up there

769
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:55,120
and then we have a board of eight board

770
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:58,000
members and we do have

771
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:58,399
um benedict who's down at the table he's

772
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,960
also

773
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:03,039
on our board we are 100 funded by

774
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:05,120
donations so we're not a membership

775
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:06,080
organization and so we do reach out to

776
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:08,719
companies

777
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:09,678
and ask them to help uh help fund our

778
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:12,240
efforts

779
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:14,840
and and so we're constantly doing that

780
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:16,480
if your company is using freebsd and

781
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:18,240
benefiting then

782
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:19,600
i would ask if you could either connect

783
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:22,799
me with the right people

784
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:25,279
or ask your company to to

785
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:26,399
help us with our funding more money we

786
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:28,320
get the more

787
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:31,840
software development that we could do as

788
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:31,840
well as advocacy for the project

789
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:36,960
so this list i know so i don't know you

790
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:38,799
might be able to read this so what i try

791
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:40,880
to do with this and this is

792
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:42,080
where the freebsd around the world comes

793
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:46,240
from so we

794
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:49,520
went we participated 38 conferences

795
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:51,120
in 21 countries this was all last year

796
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:53,360
and the whole reason is to raise

797
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:55,678
awareness about freebsd

798
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:57,039
and so at a minimum people understand

799
00:28:55,679 --> 00:29:00,720
what freebsd

800
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:03,520
is and hopefully you spark an

801
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:05,520
interest in people trying freebsd and

802
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:09,200
hopefully either becoming a user

803
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:11,918
or contributing back to the project

804
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:14,399
and so you can see here basically i went

805
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:17,679
in order so i didn't go by country

806
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:20,559
or anything and this doesn't include

807
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:23,279
bsd conferences or just conferences that

808
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:24,559
we sponsor around the world

809
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:26,480
but one thing i do want to point out

810
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:28,799
here is that um

811
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:30,000
like open source summit uh we did give

812
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:32,080
freebsd talk

813
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,159
at both of them the north america and

814
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:36,000
the european one and

815
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:37,760
if you don't know open source summit is

816
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,080
a linux foundation

817
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:41,279
conference used to be called linuxcon

818
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:43,279
and so

819
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:44,880
it's really important that we include

820
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:47,200
our voice in these

821
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:48,159
open source conferences and that's what

822
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:51,840
we're doing

823
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:54,320
and so um so

824
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:54,959
i actually included a list of sort of

825
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:57,279
like

826
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:58,240
the key conferences that we're going to

827
00:29:57,279 --> 00:30:01,039
be at or

828
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:02,559
that are happening this year i mean as

829
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:04,240
far as conferences we're going to be at

830
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:05,279
it's we have a really long list like

831
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:07,039
that one earlier

832
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:08,960
but if you're interested in getting

833
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:12,158
involved and

834
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:13,039
or finding out more about freebsd the we

835
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:15,840
have three

836
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:16,559
major bsd conferences that i have listed

837
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:18,639
up here

838
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:20,399
as well as other conferences that we're

839
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:22,880
at

840
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:24,559
so people so this slide really is for

841
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:25,840
people who are part of the community

842
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:27,918
already or people who

843
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:30,399
who want to get involved and who want to

844
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:33,440
help us advocate for freebsd

845
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:36,000
and so what because i wasn't sure

846
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:36,640
what who all was going to be in my talk

847
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,559
and so

848
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:40,480
with this slide i was hoping to convince

849
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:42,000
people to go out there so

850
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:43,840
to come to conferences like this

851
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,080
actually this is one of

852
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:48,000
our best represented conference i think

853
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:50,720
because we have

854
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,600
well we had rodrigo who he organizes

855
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:53,919
this room

856
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:55,840
and a lot of people from the community

857
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:56,559
come and if you go to our table you'll

858
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:58,158
see that

859
00:30:56,559 --> 00:30:59,918
not only are there usually like four

860
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:01,440
people behind the stand

861
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:03,600
but there's actually a group of us in

862
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:05,519
front of it and and it's just it because

863
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:06,879
there's so many of us we can't all stand

864
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:09,600
behind it and so it's

865
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:11,600
so it's a great conference for us so to

866
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:14,000
so to go to a conference

867
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:15,760
go to a linux conference and my slides

868
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:19,519
are available to share to introduce

869
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:22,640
people to freebsd and or go to a meet up

870
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:24,799
or run a meet up or go to university and

871
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:26,399
these are all things that we're doing

872
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:27,360
it's just that the foundation is very

873
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:30,239
small we can't

874
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:30,799
get to all these places and you can

875
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,799
install

876
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:33,918
you could hold it installfest which

877
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:35,440
basically means

878
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:37,360
that you go to something you go to a

879
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:38,559
meet up and everyone brings their little

880
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:42,399
laptop you install

881
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:44,320
virtualbox or some vm install freebsd

882
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:46,239
and that's just the basic and now you

883
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:47,760
can start playing with freebsd and learn

884
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:49,600
about it

885
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,960
and i have resources actually on the

886
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:52,879
right of that slide

887
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:55,840
is a list of a lot of the resources that

888
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:57,760
we do provide from flyers to stickers

889
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:59,039
someone was asking me earlier about

890
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:02,000
could they get the

891
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:03,760
like pedia for the stickers and and so

892
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:06,000
we do have people who run their

893
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:07,120
their local events and they print their

894
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:11,039
own or have their own

895
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:11,439
stickers made so this slide i like to

896
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:14,240
use

897
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:16,720
for when i go to like a linux conference

898
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:19,519
for people who are new to freebsd

899
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:20,960
and i love this graphic i don't know who

900
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:21,519
did it and i wish i did because i'll

901
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:24,559
probably

902
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:27,360
someday get in trouble for using it but

903
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:29,760
but it's showing us working together and

904
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:32,799
um and so why should we work together

905
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:33,279
it's um i mean first so say you're in

906
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:35,360
here

907
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:37,120
and you're just learning about freebsd

908
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:40,158
and you have no interest in

909
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:41,039
in switching but you're linux i know sys

910
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:43,279
admin

911
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:44,320
this way i mean it's so important just

912
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:46,559
to have that knowledge

913
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:47,360
understand how other operating systems

914
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:49,918
work

915
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:51,840
and it'll just make you better at what

916
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:54,320
you do because you may say

917
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:55,678
i hate how they do all of the stuff so

918
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:58,320
i'm going to do

919
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:58,799
you know my whatever my development my

920
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,879
work

921
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:02,000
better and that's that is how you

922
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:04,559
improve things

923
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:07,200
so we really could learn from each other

924
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:09,519
whether it's successes or failures

925
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:11,760
and um and we do have different coding

926
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:13,919
methodologies and philosophies and so

927
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:16,960
understanding the reasons for both

928
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:18,799
and so i do know people who contribute

929
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:19,919
especially developers who contribute to

930
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:22,399
freebsd

931
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:25,039
companies like google and facebook try

932
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:26,559
to hire them which is really bad for us

933
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:28,799
but because they don't usually

934
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:31,678
contribute anymore but

935
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:32,399
it's it is a good way to get really good

936
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:35,120
training

937
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:36,399
and um and they have we just have a good

938
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:38,639
reputation for

939
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:41,600
producing uh very good software

940
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:44,399
developers and that's why that happens

941
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:45,678
our code base is smaller and so it's a

942
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:49,039
great reference

943
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:51,840
platform so for learning about open

944
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:52,960
or learning about operating systems uh

945
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:56,158
it's

946
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:58,320
so you so i mean so we have uh if you

947
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:59,120
just compare the two kernels so we have

948
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:01,600
about

949
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:02,239
uh five and a half million lines of code

950
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:05,519
and

951
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:06,080
uh linux is 35 or more million lines of

952
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:07,919
code

953
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:09,918
so right there you can see like well if

954
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:11,200
i just want to look at source code

955
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:13,839
i'd probably and you know that they're

956
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:15,359
both good then i would choose a smaller

957
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:16,960
one because it's going to be easier

958
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:18,799
to find what you're interested in or

959
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:21,359
what you're looking

960
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:22,480
you know to find what you're looking for

961
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:23,918
uh previously

962
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:26,320
if you look at the whole operating

963
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:26,879
system it's about 17 million lines of

964
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:30,000
code

965
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:32,000
so and uh distribute

966
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,199
linux distribution i don't i can't even

967
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,800
tell you how many lines of code because

968
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:37,199
they're all going to be different too

969
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:38,879
but it just gives you an idea that it's

970
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:39,839
a great place to learn about operating

971
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:41,199
systems it's

972
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:42,960
if you're interested in becoming a

973
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:44,960
system programmer or

974
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:47,918
to improve your system programming

975
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:48,560
skills then it's a great way to do that

976
00:34:47,918 --> 00:34:51,040
with

977
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:52,560
freebsd and i had that quote because

978
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:54,879
this was one i found

979
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:56,639
when i was just reading uh i forgot what

980
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:58,240
where i was reading this at but

981
00:34:56,639 --> 00:35:00,240
i thought this was a really good point

982
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:02,000
that this person said that they became a

983
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:03,919
better linux system

984
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,920
by learning about freebsd so i think

985
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:08,160
that that's really important

986
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:09,040
and so why i contribute to freebsd and i

987
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:11,118
know i like

988
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:12,480
i could actually make like probably a

989
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:14,400
book on this and that's why i try to

990
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:15,920
squeeze as much as i can because

991
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:18,320
here is why i'm trying to convince

992
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:21,200
people to contribute to freebsd

993
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:21,520
but it is a very inclusive and welcoming

994
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:24,078
uh

995
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:26,079
community i was so we had a developer

996
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:28,000
summit on friday and there's a

997
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:30,000
contributor and i can't remember how

998
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,160
many years she's been involved in

999
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,200
the project i just met her for the first

1000
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:36,399
time here

1001
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:38,000
and she submitted a patch and she

1002
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:40,160
so she tweeted it i just submitted my

1003
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:42,320
first patch to

1004
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:44,879
freebsd and everyone's like reply you

1005
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:45,680
know commenting like congratulations and

1006
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:47,280
all this stuff

1007
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:50,000
which is great because then it makes you

1008
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:51,599
want to contribute more

1009
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,599
as well as also people are there

1010
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:54,640
reviewing and giving you constructive

1011
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:56,640
feedback too

1012
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:58,078
so we're assuming people aren't perfect

1013
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:59,920
when you know when they start

1014
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:01,119
contributing

1015
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:03,119
like i said it's a great way to learn

1016
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:04,000
about operating systems and because of

1017
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:06,400
the size of the

1018
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,440
project since it is smaller it's it's

1019
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:10,480
easier to make a more

1020
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:12,000
notable contribution so we've had like

1021
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:14,079
some of our interns i mean they've

1022
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,960
become sort of the like main people like

1023
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:17,599
on risk five

1024
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:18,480
is a really good example of one of my

1025
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:23,359
interns

1026
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:26,560
and um and so it is it's much easier to

1027
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:28,480
to stand out or to become an expert in a

1028
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,799
particular area that you're interested

1029
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:32,160
in

1030
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:33,200
and get involved and like i said earlier

1031
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:35,200
some of those

1032
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:36,240
original people like kirk mccusick he's

1033
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:39,359
one of the original

1034
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:41,598
bsd developers and from berkeley

1035
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:43,279
and he's on my board and he's still very

1036
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:44,720
involved in the project i mean you go to

1037
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:46,320
a conference and he's there

1038
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:48,160
and he's there talking to people and

1039
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:50,240
he's not uh you know

1040
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:51,279
uh i mean you don't have to line up talk

1041
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:53,839
to him he's

1042
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:54,880
just very approachable and very friendly

1043
00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:56,640
too

1044
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:58,960
and um and then the fact that it's

1045
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:00,879
democratically run too

1046
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:03,680
that that makes a difference is first

1047
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:06,079
getting your contributions accepted

1048
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:08,319
so what i would recommend is if you're

1049
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:10,880
interested in trying out freebsd

1050
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:12,480
just to try it and there's many ways of

1051
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:14,720
doing that from

1052
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:16,480
like i have it like i was saying that i

1053
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:18,560
have virtualbox that's typically how we

1054
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:20,839
do it with a workshop

1055
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:22,000
but you could actually get an account on

1056
00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:25,040
azure

1057
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,920
aws they have free accounts for new

1058
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:27,920
people

1059
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:29,280
and a digital ocean actually is another

1060
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:32,320
one that's really good

1061
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:33,280
and or or we also have how-to guides on

1062
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:35,520
our web

1063
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:36,400
our website so the freebsdfoundation.org

1064
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:38,320
website

1065
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:40,079
does have how-to guides and so if you

1066
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:41,760
want to just install freebsd like i'm

1067
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:44,560
doing on my other computer

1068
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:46,079
then we have a guide for that and then

1069
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:47,520
this last one i think the slide will

1070
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:49,359
disappear

1071
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:51,839
but this is some of the main resources

1072
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:55,598
that i use and most people will use for

1073
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:58,720
getting more information about freebsd

1074
00:37:55,599 --> 00:38:01,280
and but there's a lot more information

1075
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:04,000
it's really you know just google for

1076
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:05,359
freebsd and you can get what you

1077
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,839
hopefully what you want to

1078
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:08,880
know about freebsd and there's also a

1079
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:11,599
good facebook

1080
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:12,800
group there too but there's forums email

1081
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:15,119
lists there's

1082
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:16,880
many different ways to engage with the

1083
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:19,839
community

1084
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:21,359
so i have one minute left which i timed

1085
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:22,078
it perfectly so i wouldn't get too many

1086
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:24,880
questions but

1087
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:25,599
no i'm kidding but um but if you do have

1088
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:27,920
questions

1089
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:30,079
um i'll take questions now but the other

1090
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:32,240
thing too is we do have that table

1091
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:33,920
i'll be down there but also we do have

1092
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:34,399
developers down there who so if you have

1093
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:36,720
real

1094
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:37,599
you know specific or you know technical

1095
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:39,279
questions

1096
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:41,760
that they should be able to answer those

1097
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:45,760
for you so anything

1098
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:49,680
in this last 53 seconds that i have

1099
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:49,680
so who's gonna try freebsd now

1100
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:57,440
that's awesome okay okay that's great

1101
