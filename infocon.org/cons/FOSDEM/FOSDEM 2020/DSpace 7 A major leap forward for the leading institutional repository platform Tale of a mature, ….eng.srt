1
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:10,880
okay good evening everybody

2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:13,440
i'm not sure if i 100 agree with the

3
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,880
organizers policy to keep the very last

4
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,800
and best presentation the best

5
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,240
presentation for the last but given the

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,480
fact that you're all still here

7
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,520
it's probably not that bad of a of a

8
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,000
policy

9
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:26,320
uh i will try to do my best to make sure

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,279
you're not wasting your time here

11
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:34,559
and hello dylan nice to see you

12
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:36,399
um for the past 13 years i've been

13
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:38,320
working with ngos and academic

14
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:40,800
institutions to help them to

15
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,760
put their academic research and their

16
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,399
digital objects

17
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,120
online and accessible for free i've been

18
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:47,680
doing that

19
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,399
together with the team of 28 people of

20
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:52,079
admire

21
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:55,199
we are spin-off of the ku11 university

22
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:58,079
and um just in respect to our hosts uh

23
00:00:55,199 --> 00:01:03,039
ulb you albay and kayu leuven are both

24
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:03,039
two very good respectable universities

25
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:06,560
um in my talk today i will first um it's

26
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,559
a

27
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,400
i was a little bit afraid that emily was

28
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,040
gonna say practically a hundred percent

29
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,720
of what i'm

30
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,240
to bring to you so there's a little bit

31
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,439
of overlap but i will also comment a

32
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,158
little bit on the

33
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:18,960
state of academic publication today

34
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:21,680
before then

35
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,839
talking about the d space community and

36
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:27,360
institutional repositories and how

37
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:29,200
they fit into this picture

38
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,119
and the last part that's the part that

39
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:34,000
is a little bit technical but i don't

40
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:35,119
go into detail too much is how the d

41
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,960
space community

42
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:40,000
as a mature community how they currently

43
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:43,839
tackle a very

44
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,040
big uh overhaul of uh discontinuing two

45
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,600
existing uis

46
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:50,720
and introducing a new ui to replace the

47
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:52,880
two legacy ones

48
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,158
but first because it's been such a long

49
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,079
day

50
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:58,000
i know that maybe all of those papers

51
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:59,520
and all the information is is kind of a

52
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,479
blur when you're back in your rooms or

53
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,960
hotel rooms

54
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:05,280
tonight is that if if i just want to

55
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:08,318
give you one idea to take away today

56
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,520
is that everybody in the room or

57
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:12,000
everybody not

58
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,599
us admired but everybody here really has

59
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,800
the potential to

60
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:19,519
accelerate scientific progress just by

61
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,640
contributing to getting the results of

62
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,959
scientific research

63
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,640
both positive and negative into the

64
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:37,840
hands of more people

65
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:37,839
quicker and the speed

66
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,560
there compared to researchers who were

67
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:46,720
just

68
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,599
in their lab trying to make their claim

69
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,840
and their scope

70
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:51,280
as big as possible and just sit on their

71
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,280
data for years

72
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,480
that's just something that makes me

73
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:58,160
makes me cry so

74
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,160
but it's a very difficult tradeoff

75
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:02,640
so currently in that communication of

76
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,280
results how

77
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:07,760
fast are we already going today or so

78
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:10,239
what's the what's the state of the art

79
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:11,200
um let's take you back to the the

80
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:14,560
pre-internet

81
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:18,000
age where the publishers basically

82
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:20,159
had a marginal cost to print an issue

83
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,239
of a journal and also take the

84
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:25,679
distribution cost to get these

85
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:28,080
journals out to the libraries um

86
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,080
in that kind of marginal cost scenario

87
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,879
they currently don't have that anymore

88
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:34,159
because

89
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:38,798
due to the internet it it can go a lot

90
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:38,798
a lot faster than than what it was then

91
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,720
also yeah that i also wanted to mention

92
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,200
in that old model

93
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,000
authors didn't have to pay to get their

94
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,079
research published

95
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,200
but also as it is today authors didn't

96
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:52,080
get paid

97
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:54,879
to um send their research into the

98
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,799
copyright of the publishers neither

99
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:58,319
and the publishers made their margins or

100
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:00,560
they recovered their costs by

101
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:03,119
selling the subscriptions to the to the

102
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,120
libraries

103
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,400
when i go online today and especially

104
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:08,640
when we are

105
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:11,760
looking at this threatening development

106
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:14,480
of the the coronavirus i see

107
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,760
uh prestigious journals and publishers

108
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,399
making their content

109
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,440
uh available for free apparently also

110
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:22,560
instantly

111
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:24,160
so if we think about the the

112
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,160
the discussions that we had about the

113
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,440
review apparently the landsat has pages

114
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,800
on there

115
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:32,880
elsevier has pages on there so somehow

116
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,639
they have found the time to review or to

117
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,960
make sure that the

118
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:37,680
this content is accessible online which

119
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,080
is an

120
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,360
amazing development and kind of makes me

121
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,280
wonder like

122
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,560
okay we're there the problem is solved

123
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,400
and it's even solved

124
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:49,199
due to the generous help of the

125
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,638
publishers those benevolent actors in

126
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:54,320
our

127
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:56,160
in our space but let me ask you this

128
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:58,240
before i continue

129
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,440
can you raise your hands if you know

130
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,880
somebody today

131
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:03,360
who has been diagnosed with the

132
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:06,800
coronavirus anybody already

133
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,759
would be kind of scary but can you now

134
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,360
raise your hands

135
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:13,199
if you know somebody who's been

136
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,199
diagnosed with a form of cancer

137
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,880
it's a lot more people so when i want to

138
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,960
read this

139
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:23,199
recent article february so it's a very

140
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,799
recent article in clinical oncology and

141
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,680
if i'm not privileged to be on the

142
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,280
network

143
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,520
of an institution that pays for this

144
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:32,080
then i need to pay

145
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:34,000
40 for an article and if you're

146
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:36,000
approaching this as somebody who has a

147
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,840
family member who's affected

148
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,080
my point of view is always like look

149
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:41,919
it's only when i get to the pdf that i

150
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,440
can assess whether it's irrelevant or

151
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:45,359
interesting in my case

152
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,560
so i kind of want to look at maybe 100

153
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,400
of these pdfs

154
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,000
and maybe one of them will contain

155
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:52,799
something useful so

156
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,320
it's totally not not not helping me or

157
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,000
or helping people who

158
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:58,159
who don't have an institutional

159
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,240
subscription

160
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,919
but when i go to the page of this

161
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,840
journal it actually says

162
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:05,198
immediately under the the title of the

163
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,440
journal it says

164
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:09,039
supports open access and then i click on

165
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,880
it and they say

166
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:12,880
that support actually means that we

167
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:16,000
allow authors the privilege to

168
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,800
pay for uh to pay an article publishing

169
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,600
charge

170
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,960
so basically we as the publisher we we

171
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,600
do open access and close

172
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:25,758
access and if you as an author don't

173
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,600
take the paid open access option

174
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:29,680
then you're the bad guy who doesn't want

175
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,600
to set your article free

176
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,039
that wouldn't really be a problem if

177
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,720
these fees were like

178
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:36,560
fifty dollars or maybe a couple of

179
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,440
hundred dollars but in in some of the

180
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,840
journals

181
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:41,759
it's like thousands thousands of dollars

182
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,440
for an article

183
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:44,800
and i was very happy to hear that that

184
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,479
journal of

185
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,080
open source software said that they

186
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:49,840
don't charge either the author

187
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,280
and also not the reader so that that's

188
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:53,280
great

189
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,559
so we're kind of in this in this weird

190
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:58,000
hybrid mode if i

191
00:06:54,560 --> 00:07:00,800
um access a page like this uh

192
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,599
just googling hitting this page that i

193
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:06,319
as a reader i don't understand why

194
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:08,159
for for article y there's like a green

195
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:09,759
button says open access i can download

196
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,759
it then there's one that i can pay

197
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:14,160
it's not even tied to the to the

198
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:16,240
identity of the journal anymore so

199
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,759
um the question on whether we have

200
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,360
solved the problem or not i think

201
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:22,880
there's still a space

202
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:24,960
where improvements can be made

203
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,400
and one example and i took the

204
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,919
screenshot a couple of days ago but

205
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,758
apparently now there's uh

206
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:32,000
there's already i think hundreds of

207
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:34,240
results in bio archive

208
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,400
which is an example of a preprint server

209
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,639
where that preprint culture

210
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,919
in some academic disciplines is really

211
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:42,319
catching on

212
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:44,080
but the same as the the comments of the

213
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:45,919
question of these people before

214
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:48,240
of yeah i wish we could do longer

215
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:50,159
reviews to get to a higher quality

216
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,160
is that i just saw a tweet from this

217
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:55,360
afternoon is that the people from bio

218
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:58,400
archive they have actually now added

219
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:00,319
an extra banner as a warning because so

220
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,239
many people are now uh

221
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:04,160
even journalists are now going to these

222
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,319
uh corona preprints

223
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,599
and they had to add this this extra

224
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:10,160
banner to say

225
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:11,840
okay it's nice that it's up here so fast

226
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:14,319
but please watch out

227
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:15,919
this is a preprint that isn't reviewed

228
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:18,000
by somebody else

229
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:20,560
so even though it's a positive

230
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,800
initiative bioarchive itself could be

231
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:25,520
abused by people that say

232
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,160
hey i have proven that this homeopathic

233
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,560
therapy

234
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:30,400
works against five people that i treated

235
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,440
with the coronavirus i mean it could be

236
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:35,439
up there today

237
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:38,399
who knows one angle on this

238
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:40,240
and a problem is the embargo problem

239
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:43,279
that many publishers

240
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:46,320
who publish today have 12 months

241
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:47,839
or up to 24 months of embargo and

242
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,760
there's a big

243
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:51,040
initiative driven by the scientific

244
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:53,360
funders called plan

245
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,880
s which really wants to bring that

246
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:58,399
embargo to zero

247
00:08:54,880 --> 00:09:01,040
for the work that they fund

248
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:02,560
so that's a really encouraging trend um

249
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,839
i don't know what the exact timeline

250
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,518
will be but

251
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:08,000
let's be optimistic then in the next

252
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:10,240
five years from all of the funders that

253
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,519
are implanted that we will see zero

254
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,720
embargo uh

255
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:15,600
dates so the next step is that i will

256
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,600
bring this to

257
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,720
kind of my world and to show you a

258
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,360
little bit about the role of

259
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:25,920
institutions and what they do with their

260
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,920
institutional repositories in this field

261
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,279
by the way i've heard the word

262
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,279
repository

263
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:35,120
mentioned so many different times today

264
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:36,560
all with different definitions is that i

265
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:39,200
will try to say

266
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:41,760
institutional repository and with and

267
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:45,120
what i exactly mean by that is

268
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:47,839
for example um in the example of

269
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,959
student thesis is that a very famous

270
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:52,160
repository is

271
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:54,399
apollo from cambridge and when they

272
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,959
decided to put stephen hawking's thesis

273
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:57,120
up there

274
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:59,040
i think it's last year or two years ago

275
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:02,000
they got so many downloads that

276
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:04,240
their dspace repository wasn't able to

277
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,240
survive the loads those first days

278
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:08,480
but today if you go to it you can you

279
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:11,279
can access the thesis there

280
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:13,200
together with the supplementary files so

281
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:14,320
this is might have different colors this

282
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,959
is a typical

283
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,800
d space repository where you can find

284
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:19,760
the publications and the associated

285
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,959
metadata

286
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:23,680
accessible for anyone and it doesn't

287
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:26,000
stop at

288
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:27,279
academia so if you have followed the

289
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,160
news i think it was

290
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:31,680
last week you have the annual recurring

291
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:34,880
report from oxfam

292
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:38,000
who report on inequality

293
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:39,360
and they as well even though they it's a

294
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,279
different model where they

295
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:44,079
write the papers without any involvement

296
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:47,040
from from publishing or review

297
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:48,319
they also put those pdfs and and their

298
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:51,760
metadata into

299
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,760
into the space repository

300
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,839
it also doesn't stop at pdf or

301
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:59,120
text-based materials

302
00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:01,200
an example from the university of exeter

303
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:03,279
i could open it up but if you click that

304
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,680
little view more button then you can

305
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:06,640
scroll for half a minute down because

306
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:10,000
this is actually

307
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:13,120
one item that has 20 terabytes of data

308
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:16,480
all packaged up into zip files of

309
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:18,480
17 gigabytes so if you put some storage

310
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,440
solution under there there is actually

311
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,320
no

312
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,040
theoretical limit as to how many how

313
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,640
much data

314
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,240
you can refer of course the upload

315
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,199
challenge getting it in there or the

316
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,320
downloads

317
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:32,240
is another story but these 17 gigabyte

318
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,399
packages seem to seem to work pretty

319
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,399
well

320
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:40,399
so the three examples before were all

321
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,399
situations where

322
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:43,920
the materials that are there are openly

323
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:45,279
and accessible for download but

324
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,040
unfortunately

325
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:49,519
because of of course the academic

326
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:51,599
privilege linked to high impact journals

327
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:53,600
it's still the case that the libraries

328
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:56,320
who operate these repositories

329
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,720
are still tied to the situation that

330
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,760
their

331
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,320
staff can also publish in in journals

332
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:04,000
that have

333
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:07,360
embargoes so for example h says that i

334
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:10,000
in germany they tend to submit

335
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,720
the items and the pdfs as soon as

336
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,920
possible

337
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:15,440
and you can see um the embargo dates

338
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,120
that are on there

339
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,880
so it's not just so you can go in your

340
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:21,120
google calendar and say aha

341
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:22,480
in november 2020 i will go back to the

342
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,800
repository and i will get

343
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,920
the paper no if you click on the

344
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:28,079
download button

345
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,920
you get to the request a copy feature

346
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:32,959
and the request a copy feature

347
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:35,839
is a technical feature

348
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:37,760
around a privilege in academia that you

349
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:39,440
as an individual researcher

350
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:41,200
wherever you have published you can

351
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:43,440
always share

352
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:45,680
your work in a peer-to-peer fashion with

353
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:47,600
your with your peers

354
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:49,920
so even though it's now a little bit

355
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:53,360
more automated that's okay i can say

356
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:55,360
i want access for reason x or y it still

357
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,680
requires an individual to say yes you

358
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,760
get

359
00:12:55,680 --> 00:13:00,160
you get this copy but it's a very very

360
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:02,079
effective way to just

361
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:04,079
to just make sure that the metadata and

362
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:06,160
the title and everything gets out there

363
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:08,000
and that if you press the button wait a

364
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,839
few days you have a copy anyway

365
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,399
even though there's an embargo until

366
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:12,399
november

367
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,199
so i've showed you different

368
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,920
repositories and there and their urls

369
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:21,519
and the best thing

370
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:23,360
is that you as an interested user

371
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:26,000
you don't need to know these sites you

372
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:28,399
don't even need to know that they exist

373
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,839
because um in the development of the

374
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:31,760
dspace project and also other

375
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:32,959
repositories out there we have very good

376
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:36,319
relations with

377
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:39,119
google scholar who does who gives us a

378
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:41,199
very hard job actually to keep our

379
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,120
systems up for them constantly hitting

380
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:44,719
them with crawler traffic

381
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,959
but that's of course to make sure that

382
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:49,040
they can reference the both the metadata

383
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:50,319
as well as the direct pdf links in

384
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:52,319
google scholar

385
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:54,160
so if the system completely works you

386
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,519
just get the pdf straight from google

387
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:58,319
scholar

388
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:58,959
completely oblivious that there is such

389
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,040
a thing as

390
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:03,839
institutional repositories that do all

391
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,839
of this for you

392
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:09,760
so a little bit of history on the dspace

393
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,120
project and one of the reasons that i

394
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:17,400
try to submit

395
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:20,160
to this to this day today is that

396
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:24,720
[Music]

397
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:26,880
i don't know why he does that it's back

398
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,720
normally if it works you shouldn't touch

399
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:32,079
it but i need to touch it to

400
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:35,760
advance the slides is that

401
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:37,279
as a community of over 12 years old

402
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:39,760
some of the original committees have

403
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:41,279
moved on it's like any project

404
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:43,040
everybody needs developers and

405
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:44,959
contributors so if you

406
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:46,639
have some experience in java or in

407
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:48,079
angular now and if you

408
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:52,000
hear something that is of interest

409
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:54,160
you're always welcome to uh to join but

410
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,480
the reason why this space today is the

411
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:59,120
most successful

412
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:00,399
institutional repository platform is in

413
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,720
my opinion because i

414
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:03,680
i don't know maybe it was all just pure

415
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,000
luck

416
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:07,439
is the fact that it had localization

417
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,160
support very early

418
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,279
in the process so today we have there's

419
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:14,880
a fork in china

420
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:16,560
called c-space there is a whole

421
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:19,040
range of installed repositories in

422
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,839
taiwan based of that localization

423
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:22,560
support and

424
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:24,639
of course the mit licensing that that

425
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,439
allows anybody to just do whatever they

426
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:28,079
want with

427
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:29,120
with the software i'm gonna go a little

428
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:31,120
bit faster

429
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,399
because i see that i only have five

430
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:37,040
minutes left

431
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:37,040
i don't know where all that time went um

432
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:41,440
but to talk about the d space seven

433
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:43,600
version and where we're going is

434
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:46,000
and also maybe as a learning of a

435
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:48,160
project that is ten years further and um

436
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,600
a little bit in feedback to antonio's

437
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:51,920
question like yeah how

438
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:53,759
how do we tackle with evolution of the

439
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:55,199
platform and and what do we allow is

440
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:56,720
that

441
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:58,240
there used to be a tradition of

442
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,480
time-based releases in d

443
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:02,720
space where basically any contributor

444
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:04,959
could contribute or suggest something

445
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:06,959
before a feature freeze deadline

446
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:08,880
and if it didn't break other features

447
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:09,839
and if it was generally perceived as a

448
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:13,040
good idea or

449
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:15,600
or not being in the way of somebody any

450
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:18,240
contribution could just get in there so

451
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:21,519
we started off in 2002 with one ui

452
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:22,000
until um texas a m university in the us

453
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:25,120
decide

454
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:27,279
that well jsp ui it's kind of getting

455
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,480
old technology by now and we want to

456
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:31,439
have something that can

457
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:32,959
make can give specific look and feel on

458
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,800
specific collections so they came up

459
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:37,040
with a new ui

460
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:38,719
and it got accepted into the main line

461
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:41,120
but the problem at that point was

462
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,480
there was not 100 percent feature parity

463
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,800
with the old ui

464
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:47,040
so it had interesting features but it

465
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:49,599
was not convincing enough for the entire

466
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:52,079
community to say

467
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,199
of our customizations in the trash so

468
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:55,920
the the bad thing that

469
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:57,519
well the bad thing it's bad or good

470
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:59,040
depends on how you look at it is that

471
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:01,519
since that point

472
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,160
the d space project has actually split

473
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:06,319
its

474
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:08,079
community into two um xml ui community

475
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:10,000
and the jsp ui community

476
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:11,359
and i personally believe that's a bad

477
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,000
thing because

478
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:15,760
um two groups of people that deal with

479
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,839
the same problem space

480
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:19,599
have been working on creating the same

481
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:21,198
features or dealing with the same

482
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:24,319
problems into these two

483
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:24,319
two different uis

484
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:30,799
so that's why the new attempt

485
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,799
on unifying these uis also on a

486
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:34,639
technology that is more modern and

487
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:37,760
geared towards the future

488
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:40,240
is that everybody was really on the same

489
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:41,039
page of we really want to create

490
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,280
something that can

491
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:44,400
replace the two of them for the entire

492
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:47,200
community

493
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:49,520
and not just create a third ui where we

494
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:52,720
will have our community split up into

495
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:54,639
three different uh different groups so

496
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:56,400
that's also the reason why this has been

497
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,799
a quite lengthy process if you see the

498
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,320
timeline and that we went in 2016

499
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:02,320
through a formal ui

500
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,918
prototyping challenge where stakeholders

501
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:05,840
in the community could say

502
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:07,360
we're fans of this technology here are

503
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,639
the use cases that we can build and

504
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:11,678
demonstrate

505
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:12,559
and then we we as a as a company we

506
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:16,080
contributed

507
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:18,799
a prototype on ember but

508
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:20,799
we we joined in the discourse with the

509
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:21,600
community and and we all aligned

510
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:23,840
together on

511
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,719
another technology so we threw away our

512
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,639
own

513
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,840
prototype in ember and we align on the

514
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,640
fact that we were all going to build

515
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:32,639
this on

516
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:35,200
angular d space 7 together

517
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,080
so right now we're already on more code

518
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,919
commits than

519
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:39,760
some of the previous major releases

520
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:41,520
combined and we are really in this final

521
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:44,320
stretch to uh

522
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,879
to get to the end and there is one video

523
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:48,960
here

524
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,960
that i if it works

525
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:53,200
that i can just show you a bit of the

526
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:59,120
search

527
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:59,120
feature i know how to put it full screen

528
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:09,440
it's basically like the the whole

529
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,320
approach towards faceted searching in

530
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:13,280
metadata

531
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:14,399
is made a lot more responsive thanks to

532
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:16,879
the fact that with

533
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,720
with angular we can break it up into all

534
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:20,400
of these individual components and that

535
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:22,640
they can get their data

536
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,600
individually instead of always relying

537
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,320
on

538
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:27,520
more page loads to uh to bring this data

539
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:30,000
in

540
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:31,520
and maybe as a final thing and hooking

541
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,559
on to the story of the

542
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:35,840
neuroscience presentations in the

543
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:38,240
morning is that one big

544
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:39,039
evolution that we're bringing here is

545
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:41,120
that

546
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:43,039
instead of the rigid model of having

547
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:45,360
metadata and a few objects that

548
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:48,640
represent the paper or the data set

549
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:50,000
dspace 7 will also have rich entities to

550
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:52,480
kind of

551
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,120
make an entity model of anything that

552
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,120
makes

553
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:56,719
sense in in your context so when we

554
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:58,799
think about that uh

555
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:00,640
data lat that we saw this morning where

556
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:01,918
it's like okay we want data sets and

557
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:04,080
files or

558
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:06,240
some of these other neural examples

559
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:08,080
where it was a more intricate structure

560
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,760
is that we'll be able to build that

561
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:12,240
whole representation of

562
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:13,520
entities in in d space seven which is

563
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,840
something that we're uh

564
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:21,840
very excited about so thank you very

565
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:21,840
much for your attention today

566
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:31,039
questions i want to talk briefly about

567
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:34,158
definitions for

568
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:35,600
open access because it's used a lot

569
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:37,760
and there's a very good one called the

570
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:41,120
berlin declaration um

571
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:45,440
but you had stephen hawking's

572
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:45,918
phd thesis they described it as open

573
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:49,039
access

574
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:49,440
and i wrote to them and complained that

575
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:51,679
it was

576
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:53,039
copyrighted and it was free to download

577
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:55,840
but nothing else

578
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:57,120
and they wrote back um uh replied very

579
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,959
politely and quickly

580
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,879
and said no here is a here is a

581
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:02,000
perfectly good definition of open access

582
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,720
and and this this

583
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,360
particular use case complies so do you

584
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,840
have any

585
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:09,760
views about the use of that term or it's

586
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:13,600
not very protective to have the same

587
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:16,640
open source which has already solid

588
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:19,360
yeah so the question is um

589
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:20,880
what uh what definitions or the many

590
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,600
definitions that are currently going

591
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,720
around around

592
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,719
open access um

593
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,480
how we can get around that problem and

594
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,679
and about around a different

595
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:33,440
understanding

596
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:36,159
and the major issue that i see with this

597
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:37,200
is that actually some of the traditional

598
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:40,559
publishers have

599
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:43,679
co-opted the term of open access and

600
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:44,000
the fashion is that every year you add a

601
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:45,919
new

602
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,600
color or a new kind of substance in

603
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:49,760
front of it so you have green open

604
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:51,199
access gold then you have diamond open

605
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:54,080
access and whatever

606
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:55,200
and it's um sometimes i feel like it's

607
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:58,158
intentionally

608
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:59,520
intentionally made to uh to make it

609
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:02,559
confusing and to make

610
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:03,280
uh to put commercial offerings in there

611
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:05,360
that

612
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,320
that that seem like unique or a twist on

613
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,000
some things

614
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:10,080
but it's really a different thing where

615
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,360
you say a result is free that you can

616
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:14,399
just access a result

617
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:16,719
or where you really have for example

618
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:18,640
text and data mining rights or

619
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:20,400
some kind of reproducibility or just

620
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:23,280
that you that you can do

621
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:25,039
more than it just would except for only

622
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:28,639
the basic readership

623
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:30,400
so um i'm not sure if we will

624
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:33,120
end up in a situation where there will

625
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:35,440
be one agreed definition of open access

626
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:37,520
maybe you just have to find a very

627
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:39,840
original caller you can say this is

628
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:40,559
pink openaccess.org you make a website

629
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,399
and you say

630
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:44,399
this is what it now means and if you get

631
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:47,039
enough traction maybe pink open access

632
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:47,039
is the future

633
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:54,400
do you have a feature in the display to

634
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:57,678
actually

635
00:22:54,400 --> 00:23:00,080
expose the bibliographic api for

636
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:01,440
typically research lab websites where

637
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:04,240
they want to

638
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,960
provide the bibliography of their

639
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:07,919
research

640
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:08,559
researchers can you easily do that with

641
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:11,840
the space

642
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:13,760
yeah um the question is whether uh

643
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:15,918
dspace 7 will have apis so

644
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,640
bibliographies can be easily integrated

645
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:20,159
in other

646
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:22,480
other websites absolutely so in past

647
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:25,200
versions we already had a rest api

648
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:27,039
that allowed this kind of behavior so

649
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,880
getting the publications by collection

650
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:31,039
or community or authors

651
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:33,360
but we really decided that we want to

652
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:34,240
eat our own dog food and that dspace 7

653
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:37,360
has to be

654
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:40,080
the new ui has to be a primary consumer

655
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:41,199
of the rest api so in d space seven we

656
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:43,360
are really exposing

657
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,240
all of the business logic including

658
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,559
workflows

659
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:48,400
um everything that you can imagine the

660
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:50,000
statistics on the on the downloads and

661
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:52,720
everything everything is now also

662
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,799
in the in the web ui uh so in the rest

663
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:57,200
api so everything that the rest api

664
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:58,639
can do as an application you could also

665
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:01,039
kind of transfer to

666
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:05,840
or other applications by calling the

667
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:05,840
recipr yourself

668
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:18,240
i've absolutely no idea why the software

669
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:20,480
is called d space

670
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,919
it's just a name but the funny if you

671
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,799
really go back in history there's

672
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:24,559
another

673
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:26,000
uh package coming out of the university

674
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:28,399
of southampton called

675
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,640
e-prince so in the beginning e-prince

676
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:33,520
and e-space were the two competitors and

677
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:35,760
it's actually the the same uh

678
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:36,639
software developer and now his name just

679
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:39,840
escapes me

680
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:40,400
