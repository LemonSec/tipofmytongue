00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,280
welcome everyone

2
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:12,320
i am abigail garner and joining me is

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,320
elon barr

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:16,800
we are with least authority based in

5
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:21,279
berlin we have a

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:24,000
team that is across 19 time zones

7
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:26,560
leased authority is committed to

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,080
building and supporting the development

9
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:33,519
of i'm not miked

10
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:37,360
i mean the mic is for the the live

11
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:40,399
but i'll speak up um lease authority

12
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:43,840
is committed to building and supporting

13
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:45,039
the development of usable technology

14
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:50,879
solutions

15
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:59,280
and ethical business practices

16
00:00:50,879 --> 00:01:01,920
one moment

17
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,800
and ethical business practices that

18
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,720
support

19
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:07,439
uh the privacy as a fundamental human

20
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:13,840
right

21
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:13,839
and secure solutions for everyone

22
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:20,799
yeah so this project is supported by

23
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,520
open technology fund and it is looking

24
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:24,159
at

25
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:27,840
file sharing and storage for human

26
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:27,840
rights organizations

27
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:42,880
we're looking to make this process more

28
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:46,320
secure for human rights organizations

29
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:49,679
this is using tahoe laughs a

30
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:51,520
secure file system that is open source

31
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,119
also the tools being used for this

32
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:56,880
integrated with tahoe laughs

33
00:01:53,119 --> 00:02:00,159
are grid sync magic folders and

34
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:01,119
magic wormhole we'll have links to those

35
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:03,439
at the end

36
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:04,719
the four partner organizations that are

37
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:06,719
human rights organizations that's been

38
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:09,758
really key to our research

39
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:12,879
are based in mexico nigeria india

40
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:15,920
and argentina uh what we

41
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:16,560
we work with them in throughout this

42
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,958
progress

43
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,000
process it's going to be about 18 months

44
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:21,680
in total

45
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,520
and it was important for us in our

46
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,040
criteria is to look at organizations

47
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,599
that had a human rights

48
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:29,359
track record they were also they also

49
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:30,879
had expressed a need for secure file

50
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,720
storage and sharing

51
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:34,720
and that they also had the capacity in

52
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,640
terms of time and staff to participate

53
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,800
in a long-term project

54
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,839
and finally we wanted to make sure that

55
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:43,440
it had the

56
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:47,040
global diversity for to represent

57
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:48,959
different parts of different regions

58
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,720
so why human rights organizations when

59
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,599
we focus on human rights organizations

60
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,800
we're looking at

61
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:57,839
groups that have very sensitive data

62
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:59,920
things that have identities

63
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,840
even if it's not names it may be people

64
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:04,879
in locations or

65
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:06,239
experiences that really tie that data to

66
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:08,640
a particular person

67
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:10,800
and we're talking about things like

68
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:14,079
witness testimonies

69
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:15,040
films photos so a lot of things that

70
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,599
would be

71
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:19,519
high risk if they were found also if

72
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:22,238
they were

73
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:23,040
found by people that should not be

74
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:25,120
seeing them

75
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:27,359
also in terms of the threat model their

76
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,920
risks are very high we're talking about

77
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,920
things like

78
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:34,480
harm to your to your body or threats to

79
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,679
yourself

80
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,560
or your family members and situations

81
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:42,080
like detention

82
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:43,599
or um or interrogation

83
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,200
they also these organizations because

84
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:48,238
they're doing such

85
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:51,359
work that is pressing and often

86
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:52,720
under stressful situations they have

87
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,519
limited resource and time

88
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:57,920
to learn new tools so if we can make

89
00:03:55,519 --> 00:04:00,239
these tools more usable for them

90
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:02,480
they're more likely to adopt them and

91
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,799
then we also as we make them more usable

92
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,560
for

93
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:06,400
human rights organizations we're making

94
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,799
them more usable

95
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,439
for everyone and finally this is aligned

96
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:12,879
with

97
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:16,560
lease authority's mission to participate

98
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:19,199
in in within the internet freedom space

99
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,199
and human rights

100
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:26,639
thanks abigail i hope i'll speak loud

101
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,000
and clear enough for everyone to hear me

102
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:30,479
also on the back

103
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
okay thanks so what do you want to learn

104
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:33,280
as part of the research that we did for

105
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,880
this project

106
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,559
so we did the research as part of two

107
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:38,080
phases and i'll tell you about both

108
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,000
phases so in the first phase

109
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:42,080
the goal for the research was to find

110
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,680
out what the file sharing what the file

111
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,599
storage needs are of human rights

112
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,199
organizations

113
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,880
so we did that research by first

114
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:51,759
selecting human rights organizations and

115
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:53,600
abigail spoken to that just a second ago

116
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:55,280
and then we shared a survey with them

117
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,560
that they filled out to explain

118
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,880
what they're doing at the moment when

119
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,479
they want to share files or store files

120
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,919
and we followed up with foundational

121
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:03,840
interviews basically where we had a

122
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:05,198
chance to talk to them more in depth

123
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,919
about the things that they feel that's

124
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:09,840
in the survey that was the first phase

125
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:11,680
in the first phase we discovered that

126
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:13,039
the sharing use case was the one that we

127
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,720
probably wanted to focus on for the

128
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:15,680
remainder of the project

129
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,520
and i'll tell you a little bit more

130
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,919
about how we came to that but just to

131
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,080
share

132
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:21,520
what the second phase looked like and

133
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,039
the second phase were actually still in

134
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,599
but the research that we've done so far

135
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:28,240
basically focused on first describing

136
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,960
those file usage as far storage and file

137
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,479
sharing

138
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,919
needs of human rights to organizations a

139
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:33,280
bit more in depth and also focusing more

140
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:36,159
on collaboration

141
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:37,919
and secondly to do a usability study of

142
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,680
one of the open source tools that we

143
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:40,799
work with at abigail mentioned gridsync

144
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,479
and gridsync

145
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,919
is the graphical user interface of tahoe

146
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:45,680
labs

147
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:47,039
so we did more foundational interviews

148
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,880
with these organizations and an

149
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:50,960
additional organization

150
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:53,280
and then we did a moderated usability

151
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:55,520
test which means that we

152
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:57,359
had the organizations and the people

153
00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:00,000
that we tested with

154
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,039
run through some tasks using gridsync so

155
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,600
that we can see

156
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:04,960
how usable the program is at the moment

157
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,600
is actually something that it can work

158
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:09,039
with

159
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:11,360
is it easy to use etc so what did we

160
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:12,800
learn as part of this research

161
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,800
in the first phase as i mentioned we did

162
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,160
mostly needs finding and we won't have

163
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,960
time to share everything that we learned

164
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,160
so we'll just share some highlights

165
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,318
we learned that organizations have

166
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,479
different file storage and sharing needs

167
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:27,039
well this may sound self-evident but

168
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:28,719
it's not as self-evidence may seem

169
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:29,840
and it's important for us to keep that

170
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,280
in mind because human rights

171
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:33,520
organizations comes in many

172
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,799
shapes forms colors and everything they

173
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:37,520
do many different things

174
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,800
they have different use cases and that

175
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,479
means that there's also generally not

176
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,400
like a one size fits all for the work

177
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:43,680
that they do

178
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,039
one thing that was interesting in that

179
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,240
sense that we learned about the

180
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:48,560
different ways that they choose the

181
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,919
tools that they work with

182
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,240
there are many different factors that

183
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:54,159
fed into this choice and so for example

184
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,440
when human rights organizations choose a

185
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,840
tool to work with

186
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:59,039
security practices matter and security

187
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,638
threats that they face

188
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:02,000
abgil talked about the threat modeling

189
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:03,599
that they need to do to understand what

190
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,479
kind of threats they're facing from whom

191
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:05,919
etc

192
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:08,479
and it also leads to different kind of

193
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:10,000
security practices so some organizations

194
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:11,758
may fear that their laptops will be

195
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
stolen from their office

196
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:15,360
and instead they put things in the safe

197
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,560
or they might fear that their absolute

198
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,479
will get stolen when they go into the

199
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,319
street because they might get mugged

200
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:22,479
and so they don't take laptops into the

201
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:24,400
street or they might fear surveillance

202
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:26,719
of their digital equipment so they

203
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,599
might fear that if they send an email

204
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,520
that there will be

205
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:30,800
something intercepted and it also

206
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,080
changes the kind of tools that they

207
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,840
choose

208
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,758
other factors that contribute to this

209
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,359
choice of tools are the file size of

210
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:39,520
particular thing that they want to

211
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,720
share does it fit into an email or not

212
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,159
do they need to share it through some

213
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,520
different means like we transfer or

214
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,440
dropbox

215
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:47,680
whether they need to collaborate with

216
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:50,879
other organizations as part of it

217
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:52,720
how easy specific tools to use the

218
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:55,440
privacy features of particular

219
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,080
tools or the reputation that they have

220
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,080
whether to

221
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,120
costs or whether it's free or how much

222
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,199
it would cost

223
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,560
and lastly the choice of the partners

224
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:04,080
that they work with

225
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,240
i'll tell you a little bit about that

226
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,599
one um now

227
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,599
so the partners of human rights

228
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:11,039
organizations so the other organizations

229
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:12,000
human rights organizations work with

230
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:14,400
they have a large role

231
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,280
to play when organizations choose what

232
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,280
tools they can use

233
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,479
human rights organizations tend to not

234
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:22,160
work in isolation they're usually part

235
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:23,758
of networks they collaborate they do

236
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,879
campaigns together they do research

237
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:26,479
together

238
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,080
and that leads to the fact that when

239
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:29,840
they use a tool they often look to their

240
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,359
partners to understand what tools their

241
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,718
partners are using

242
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,000
and when they have a sense for what

243
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:34,719
tools the partners are using they might

244
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,799
affect the tool

245
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:38,159
the tools that they can choose or vice

246
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:40,240
versa when they think oh we want to use

247
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:41,679
this tool then they consider well

248
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,200
actually i'm not sure if this part

249
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:44,719
organization could work with that or

250
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,920
would work with that so we might need to

251
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,600
reconsider

252
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,199
and also some organizations actively

253
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,640
give advice to other organizations for

254
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,000
what tools to use

255
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:54,240
so there was an interesting thing for us

256
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,240
to find out about so how this partner or

257
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,360
partner organizations of these human

258
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:00,160
rights organizations

259
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,519
play such a key role another thing we

260
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,959
learned is that collaboration is really

261
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:04,640
an important use case

262
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:06,399
so oftentimes it's not about extending a

263
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:08,319
file to another party

264
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:09,440
it is often about working together in

265
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,600
specific documents

266
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,600
so that was really a thing that struck

267
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,200
us as part of this research

268
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,360
so some of the recommendations that we

269
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,959
came uh out of this research with were

270
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,839
that we wanted to focus on the

271
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:23,439
collaboration

272
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:24,800
sharing use cases and we figured well

273
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:27,040
within the scope of what we can do

274
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:28,560
within this project we can't go to let's

275
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,640
say real-time collaboration new

276
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:32,479
real-time editing together but we can do

277
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:34,480
asynchronous editing

278
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,080
and we can look at things like version

279
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,399
control which really matter when you

280
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:40,399
collaborate together on something

281
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:42,480
we thought we can figure that we can

282
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:45,200
also improve the sharing workflow

283
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,959
of the tools that we work with and

284
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:50,640
overall just improve the ease of use of

285
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:54,560
the tools

286
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:55,279
yep absolutely yeah so the second phase

287
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,560
of research

288
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:58,160
we decided to focus on sharing

289
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:00,479
collaboration and also to do this

290
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:01,760
usability study that we mentioned before

291
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,000
so just one thing that we wanted to

292
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:06,240
highlight from this version control

293
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,760
uh finding that we learned as part of

294
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,279
the second phase is that

295
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,720
version control is especially important

296
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:12,320
when collaborating so when people are

297
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,040
working by themselves in a particular

298
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,200
file

299
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,880
being able to go into earlier versions

300
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,959
etc seem to be less critical as when

301
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:21,920
people are working together on the file

302
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:22,479
we identified four needs in that context

303
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,719
one is

304
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:26,800
the need to be able to restore earlier

305
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,320
versions of the document or a file or to

306
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:31,279
view earlier versions

307
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,000
two would be to view track changes three

308
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:34,399
would be to see

309
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,040
when changes were made and four to see

310
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:38,399
who has made changes

311
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,240
i also want to share just a few

312
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:42,000
highlights from the usability study that

313
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:44,240
we did with gridsync

314
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,920
this is the user interface of gridsync

315
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:48,480
so this is the file storage and file

316
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:49,920
sharing tool that we use with tahoe labs

317
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,600
so we asked the organization that we

318
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:53,760
worked with as part of the test to

319
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,720
see if they can share this real cat

320
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,040
folder

321
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,000
with a recipient just want to ask people

322
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,439
in the audience

323
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,959
how would you do that if you see this

324
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,480
interface and you want to share the real

325
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:06,319
cat folder

326
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,320
what would you do any idea

327
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:11,439
sorry you would drag and drop okay

328
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,519
right click on folder sorry

329
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,519
okay so right click on folder or on the

330
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,519
three dot menu

331
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:28,720
so sorry click on the white

332
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:31,760
okay uh on the invite you said yes

333
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,959
gotcha so uh we learned that when we

334
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,240
asked this question that

335
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:36,880
this was actually not something that was

336
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:38,800
very intuitive to people and so this

337
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:40,480
important task that we had for people to

338
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:43,680
share something with

339
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:46,640
others seem not to be as easy as um

340
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:48,239
it should be so basically the way it

341
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,839
works now is that people can indeed

342
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,839
click on invites and then click on

343
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:52,959
enter invite code that's our create

344
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:55,200
invite code

345
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:56,000
or they can indeed right click or click

346
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,279
on the three dots

347
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,600
and then choose sync with device and

348
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:01,040
create invite code but even if people

349
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,399
reach that stage it wasn't necessarily

350
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,319
clear to them that yes this is the path

351
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:05,600
for them to follow this is the most

352
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,720
effective way and yes now they're

353
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,200
certain that they're doing the thing

354
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,480
that they're seeking to do

355
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,519
something that did work well as part of

356
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,120
the research that people seem to

357
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:14,240
understand that this sharing use case

358
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,160
was something where

359
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,360
people sync a folder together so it's

360
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:19,199
not something that you share

361
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,200
in one direction but once you share

362
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,560
something with another person

363
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,639
then the other person can also make

364
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,439
changes to that folder and also then

365
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:28,560
what happens

366
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:29,920
with that folder on your own device so

367
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,359
some of the recommendations we came out

368
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,959
of this research method to focus on

369
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:35,040
version control on

370
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:36,239
previous versions when chains were made

371
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,920
who made changes

372
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,360
to improve things in the sharing

373
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,079
workflow to make sure that the user

374
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,519
intent

375
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:43,839
is reflected in the way people can

376
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:45,440
access the interface and also provide

377
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:46,639
more guidance in some areas

378
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,639
and also we actually need to do more

379
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:51,839
user testing as part of

380
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:55,200
the outcomes on particular aspects of

381
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:55,200
i will hand it over to abigail

382
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:58,880
since a key part of this research has

383
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:01,680
been working with our or

384
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:02,240
our partner organizations we wanted to

385
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,719
share

386
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:06,079
some information we'd like to pass on if

387
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,560
you're thinking about working with human

388
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:11,760
rights organizations in this situation

389
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:12,638
um we had about four months scheduled to

390
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,720
find these

391
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:16,160
four partners that would commit with

392
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:19,200
with us for this um

393
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:21,199
for for this project and we actually it

394
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,480
took we underestimated how much time we

395
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,360
would need for that it took us about

396
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:26,160
seven months

397
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:27,839
and that has to do with um some

398
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:31,120
suspicion around what we're doing

399
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:32,720
building that trust and um and some

400
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,079
some of the no's that we heard were

401
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,920
because they actually had bad

402
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:38,079
experiences with other development

403
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:39,760
projects so there's also some learning

404
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:43,199
to happen there

405
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:45,040
and we um we ended up we've now extended

406
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:46,880
our project a bit in order to do that

407
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,880
but the way that we did our outreach was

408
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:50,320
we went to the internet freedom space

409
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:52,240
and the human rights space

410
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,600
introduced people it got introduced to

411
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,720
people and then they introduced us to

412
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:58,639
people but that took

413
00:13:54,720 --> 00:14:00,240
quite a while longer than we anticipated

414
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:02,000
it's really important that we compensate

415
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:05,360
these individuals as the professionals

416
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,880
and the um the experts that they are

417
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,240
so keep that in mind they're not going

418
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,600
to do this work for free they already

419
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,279
have enough on their plate

420
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,519
so make sure that you work that into

421
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:14,800
your budget and be upfront with them

422
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:17,040
about what incentives

423
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,319
you can offer so that you're really not

424
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,880
wasting their time if it's not going to

425
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,639
work in

426
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:22,160
in their plan what we were able to do

427
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:24,240
with this project is

428
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:25,680
invite them to meet us in person at a

429
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,480
conference that they would be attending

430
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:29,040
anyway

431
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,519
so internet freedom festival or rights

432
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,399
con

433
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:34,320
they would be there and we would cover

434
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:35,839
their travel expenses and their hotel

435
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,440
and other related expenses

436
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:40,720
in exchange for two to four hours of

437
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:42,800
meeting with us during that time

438
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,079
defining the expectation the clear

439
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,959
expectations and commitment

440
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:48,638
really helps the organizations get a

441
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:51,040
sense of what you're asking for

442
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:53,120
that there are no surprises so we

443
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:54,160
developed a memorandum of understanding

444
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:57,120
an mou

445
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:58,000
that really told them which activities

446
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,600
we were doing

447
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,600
how many hours each of them would take

448
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:04,639
the maximum time over this

449
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:07,199
over this project is 32 hours

450
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:09,360
and we also made it clear that this was

451
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:11,040
a non-binding

452
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,120
non-binding agreement not even a

453
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,560
contract that was important because of

454
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,639
the suspicion that there may

455
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:18,239
they may somehow be legally liable for

456
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:20,639
something along the way or kind of

457
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:24,320
if they need to drop out at some point

458
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:24,320
they can do that without consequences

459
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:29,040
we had uh we faced challenges with low

460
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:31,439
bandwidth and other

461
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:33,040
connectivity limitations we did some of

462
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:36,000
our user testing

463
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:37,199
uh remotely and there were specific

464
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,639
challenges to that

465
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:40,319
one of them of course is when they're

466
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:41,279
showing they're sharing their screen

467
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:44,240
with us

468
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:44,639
we um can't see their faces um so we

469
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,160
they

470
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:47,920
would talk through what they're doing

471
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:50,959
and we could glean from that

472
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:54,240
and from what was on the screen but um

473
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:55,758
but they're the those

474
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,519
problems that come up that you kind of

475
00:15:55,759 --> 00:16:00,320
work through you see how they

476
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:02,399
work around them and how and it informs

477
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:05,040
our work more on a positive note it

478
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:05,519
informs our work in being aware of the

479
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,560
real

480
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:10,240
um challenges and circumstances uh that

481
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:13,439
that human rights organizations are

482
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:15,519
dealing with in the field

483
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,800
and finally to be aware that their

484
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:19,279
threat modeling may not

485
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:20,319
fit your framework of what is safe and

486
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:21,920
what is private

487
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,600
so keep that in mind every time you

488
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:26,160
include them in discussing

489
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,800
your project whatever it is check back

490
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:29,680
with them

491
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,880
it also um that builds trust and it also

492
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,319
um

493
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:34,000
keeps them engaged with the project

494
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,800
because for example they know where it

495
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,560
foster

496
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:38,079
and they know they each one of these

497
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,199
organizations consented to have their

498
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:40,479
names in the slides with the

499
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:41,199
understanding that that would also be

500
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,839
online

501
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:44,479
so we continue to do that in every time

502
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:47,920
that we

503
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:49,519
mention them so um

504
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:52,639
don't presume that it's that it's okay

505
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:55,440
with them until you've checked

506
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:57,680
right now we have discussed our findings

507
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,079
with our team including the developers

508
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,959
and

509
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:02,479
that is currently underway for for

510
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:05,678
making those

511
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:08,319
changes and then we will go back to the

512
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:09,120
organizations again and do more user

513
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,959
testing

514
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:13,280
at that point we will work with them in

515
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:16,799
deployment and that will inform

516
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:21,918
how we um how we do documentation for

517
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:21,918
uh for broader deployment in the future

518
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:27,679
and those are our um the tools the open

519
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,559
source tools that we're using as well as

520
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:30,720
our

521
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:33,840
website and a blog post specifically

522
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,840
about this project

523
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:47,840
what questions are there

524
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:55,039
what file storage and sharing tools that

525
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:57,520
they use

526
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:59,360
a wide variety for different purposes

527
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:01,760
and so

528
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:03,199
in some cases they're just sending an

529
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:05,760
email in some cases

530
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:07,600
um they want they make sure that they're

531
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:11,200
sending encrypted email

532
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:14,480
there are other situations where the

533
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:16,000
they don't even want it to be anywhere

534
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,200
except on their computer and the other

535
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,480
person's computer and so

536
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:22,880
they are walking a usb to that

537
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:24,400
that other organization um i mean

538
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:27,200
because so many of these

539
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:30,480
organizations work with with others um

540
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,480
and then depending on

541
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:34,559
google drive is a big one and um and

542
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:38,160
also very

543
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:40,480
um popular because their partners

544
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:42,720
are also working and so if they need it

545
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:44,880
they see it as some uh someone said

546
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,160
um we just need to get the work done and

547
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,799
so sometimes

548
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:50,000
assessing safety over convenience that's

549
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:53,200
constantly the dance

550
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:56,799
for them um

551
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,799
what else does that come from

552
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:01,120
crypt pads yeah cryptpad was a big one

553
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:03,918
for

554
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:04,239
um but one of the feedback about that is

555
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:06,720
the

556
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:09,760
formatting is not there the way they'd

557
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,760
like it in collaboration

558
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:25,918
i'm sorry again

559
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:28,080
how many people are using our tool right

560
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:28,080
now

561
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:31,918
with the human rights organizations they

562
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:34,720
have not they have not

563
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:39,840
deployed it yet so they are they've just

564
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:39,840
participated in the user testing so far

565
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,919
what was their feedback

566
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,399
the feedback on gridsync and what we

567
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:51,520
showed them there

568
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,640
yeah so many of them said that well this

569
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,879
is actually something that

570
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,919
worked quite easily and yes we can work

571
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,760
with this

572
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:59,120
and at the same time as we did the test

573
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:01,520
that was not always

574
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:02,959
as evident right so this is part of the

575
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:04,480
lesson that

576
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,000
organizations or people when they use

577
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,280
something and they go

578
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,120
through the motions and they've learned

579
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,879
how it works and okay yes

580
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:12,959
i can use this this is fine this is

581
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,760
workable but at the same time to get to

582
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,200
that process

583
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:17,120
actually there are a lot of stumbling

584
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,320
blocks and so there are all sorts of

585
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,678
things that

586
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:22,320
we learned from there that oh actually

587
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:23,120
this is not so self-evident or this is

588
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,960
not

589
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:26,399
as clear as it should be for people to

590
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:29,039
use it without any

591
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,039
any barrier

592
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:38,158
any other questions you mentioned

593
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:47,360
so as part of the agreement that we have

594
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:48,158
with with these organizations they've

595
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:50,719
agreed that

596
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:52,320
um if they want to that they can deploy

597
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,679
the tool that we will offer them

598
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,520
and so that is something that we're

599
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:58,400
looking forward to do in the next

600
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:59,280
few months and so we have to see exactly

601
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,559
how that will be

602
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:02,720
if there's something they can work with

603
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:03,600
if they also have the facilities to work

604
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,960
with that

605
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:07,199
server space and all these kind of

606
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:08,960
things but generally there is a

607
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:11,200
willingness and interest to to use that

608
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,200
yes

609
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:17,840
any other questions please

610
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:32,320
how it works technically on the hosting

611
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,320
side

612
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:46,000
so as part of the this particular

613
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:47,679
project it seems like we

614
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,280
will not provide the hosting ourselves

615
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:51,039
but that we will help them with

616
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,799
organizing hosting for themselves so

617
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:54,879
they can actually use their own servers

618
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:56,158
for that so some of these organizations

619
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,919
use their own servers and they're used

620
00:21:56,159 --> 00:22:01,760
to using their own servers so we can

621
00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:01,760
help them deploy tower labs in such a

622
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:13,120
context

623
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:13,120
or did you just by chance

624
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:22,240
we had a statement of what we were doing

625
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:23,600
that improved the more we learned when

626
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,960
we heard people's resistance or

627
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,760
misunderstanding of what we were trying

628
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,480
to do

629
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:30,240
so we had a statement of that plan and

630
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:33,440
then we distributed that

631
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:35,200
to various mailing lists and um

632
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:41,840
and through other people's personal

633
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:41,840
networks that's how that worked

634
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:53,120
um you mentioned that for some

635
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:55,360
organizations they'd already been

636
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:57,439
burned and in that case didn't want to

637
00:22:55,360 --> 00:23:00,639
collaborate to explore it further

638
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:03,919
did they also explain how or why and

639
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:07,919
did you try to explain

640
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:09,760
why your solution is better or workable

641
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:12,880
yeah i can speak to that the question is

642
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:13,840
um what um when organizations would talk

643
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:16,000
about their resistance

644
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:17,918
and their the negative experiences they

645
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:21,120
had with other development projects

646
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:22,880
um i i can speak to it very generally to

647
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:25,600
say that they would put a lot of

648
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,240
work and effort into their feedback and

649
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,840
and then

650
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:30,080
the response of the people that were

651
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:33,199
developing the tool was not necessarily

652
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:34,480
oh that that they didn't give a reason

653
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,880
for why it was wrong

654
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:38,000
only flippant response is like yeah

655
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,240
we're not going to do that

656
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,520
or um that's not the one of the quotes

657
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,840
was that's not sexy

658
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,720
so they're kind of like putting this

659
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:47,199
heartfelt

660
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:48,640
effort into sharing what their risks are

661
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,400
and sharing what their experiences are

662
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:52,080
and say here's what we need

663
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,760
and then developers saying yeah you

664
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:56,240
maybe you need that but we're not going

665
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,240
to do that

666
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:07,039
thanks very much

667
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,039
you
