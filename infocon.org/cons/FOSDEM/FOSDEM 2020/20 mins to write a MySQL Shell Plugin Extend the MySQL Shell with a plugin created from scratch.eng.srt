1
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:08,879
thank you for staying

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,400
20 minutes to write the mysql shell

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,120
plugin and you will see i don't even

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:14,160
need that

5
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:16,160
that much i guess so who

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,400
knows who never heard about my skull

7
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:21,680
shell

8
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:24,720
never oh good you should abuse it on

9
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,720
other databases

10
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,919
yeah but here is my squash so

11
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,640
unfortunately i won't talk too much

12
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:33,200
about the

13
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,640
the shell right uh but let me show you

14
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,160
how it works because

15
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,840
i was expecting that a lot of people

16
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:40,398
knew my scholarship

17
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,440
uh if you want to know much more about

18
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:44,000
mysql shell

19
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,839
i wrote a lot of stuff on my blog and

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,559
i'm from belgium so

21
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,640
i'm used to the belgium water that you

22
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:51,440
all had yet last night so that's why i'm

23
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,879
still

24
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:58,320
up at the end of the day so

25
00:00:54,879 --> 00:01:00,079
writing a plugin

26
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,359
to write a plugin there are some steps

27
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:04,000
that we need to think about

28
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:05,519
and the first one is the most

29
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,960
complicated for me i guess

30
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:12,000
it's the idea what should my plugin do

31
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:15,039
right and most of the plugin i'm sharing

32
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,080
on github are because people are asking

33
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,400
questions on the

34
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,439
mysql community slack on the mysql

35
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,159
forums

36
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:23,360
or the events and then they say oh i'm

37
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:25,280
trying to do this

38
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:27,040
and i'm not i don't know how to do it

39
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:30,159
then i said oh yeah well i make a

40
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:33,920
shell to make it easy for you then

41
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:36,720
uh when you have an id so i will

42
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,400
create this plugin you need to find the

43
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:41,520
programming language

44
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,399
so after that you need to define a file

45
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,158
structure

46
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:46,079
that i will show you then writing the

47
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,880
code which is not that complicated i

48
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:49,520
guess

49
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,000
and then testing it test techniques can

50
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,000
be

51
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,680
more complicated when you integrate

52
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,759
multiple stuff in your

53
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,680
in your shell plugin for example i have

54
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:59,520
shell plugin that shows uh

55
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,719
that interacts directly with the mysql

56
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,119
router or

57
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:04,240
shell plugins that configure proxy sql

58
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:07,119
that we heard about

59
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,759
uh earlier today so we can do a lot of

60
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:11,920
stuff with the

61
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:13,520
with the shell so uh the ide

62
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,200
this is the most complicated part so i

63
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:18,000
was thinking what could i show

64
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:20,160
could i show and that won't take me ages

65
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,800
to code for

66
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,920
for the event so our plugin will take a

67
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,720
variable

68
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,720
so as a

69
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:31,360
as an entry right as an argument and it

70
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,000
will display all the information about

71
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,599
that because

72
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,160
maybe as you know we keep some

73
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:38,959
information about variables and that are

74
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,440
possible to find in the in performance

75
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:40,720
schema

76
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:43,519
so we're gonna we're gonna play like

77
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:47,200
that so this is the idea for today

78
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:50,160
then the language i'm a very poor

79
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:52,399
javascript guy

80
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,840
peop my friends knowing javascript told

81
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:57,120
me it's because i'm too old

82
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:59,040
that i don't get it but

83
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,800
i'm not don't get it so i'm not able to

84
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,560
write anything in javascript uh

85
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,640
all this mode synchronous modem still

86
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:08,640
you know i learned cobble at school so

87
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:09,119
sorry guys yeah do you know javascript

88
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,159
yeah

89
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:14,319
you're a sick mind you think you know it

90
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:14,319
right

91
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:21,440
yeah yeah java is not for me either

92
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:24,159
right so uh so i i choose python right

93
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,799
so this is javascript still a mystery

94
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:26,879
for me

95
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:28,000
let's go write it in python anything

96
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:29,840
it's easy

97
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,440
and i like the python dev room so

98
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,640
they're my friends so i will do it in

99
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:35,760
python

100
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,839
right three sorry

101
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:40,879
i'm not that old

102
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:44,080
[Laughter]

103
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:48,000
so the plugin we need to uh

104
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:52,000
to put it in the the our

105
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,319
user home directory dot mysql sh

106
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,560
then plugin and then the extension there

107
00:03:54,319 --> 00:04:00,238
so this is where it should be located

108
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:02,879
and this is the files we need to have

109
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:04,080
in it to create a to underscore the

110
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:06,640
score init underscore

111
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,200
api mostly empty this is just to make

112
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:11,679
our

113
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:13,679
object then uh mysql is h plugin common

114
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,360
you should not write it i will provide

115
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:18,880
it to you and i use the same for

116
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:20,639
every time for every uh every plugin

117
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,880
it's just registration and stuff like

118
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:25,280
that then uh

119
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,479
usually i use a directory to put my

120
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,400
older code that

121
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:29,840
will be related to my plugin but it can

122
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:32,159
be only one file

123
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,440
but i i like to use one directory so i

124
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:37,280
will call it fosdem

125
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:40,320
then inside again this uh

126
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:43,679
init to say to be able to

127
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:46,240
make a an instance of this object

128
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,240
then a real init.pi with some code in it

129
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:51,440
registration of the variables

130
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,960
and the the methods and then some files

131
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,240
and i will call it variables because

132
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:57,440
this is what we're going to

133
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,080
use today right so the first one it's an

134
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,639
empty file

135
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,520
very easy to do i think everybody can do

136
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:06,240
it

137
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:09,599
the other one uh yeah it will uh

138
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:13,280
you can find it on github

139
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:15,759
or you can copy it let's say

140
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,400
i will show you what's what's in it and

141
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:18,479
it has the

142
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,440
the all the registration of the plugin

143
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:20,960
for the shell

144
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,039
so you don't need to to do that every

145
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:25,359
time you call the shell right

146
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:26,080
then the code of our plugin they need

147
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,160
file again

148
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,280
always empty so again something very

149
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,880
easy to do

150
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:34,159
and then uh the method registration so

151
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,880
all the methods we're gonna create in

152
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,160
the

153
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:40,080
in the real code we need to register it

154
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,759
because which is very something very

155
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,560
nice with the plug-in infrastructure of

156
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,320
the shell

157
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,560
is that it will create for example all

158
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,520
the help for me so i don't need to write

159
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,639
all that

160
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:52,400
so as soon as i will register my methods

161
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:54,400
it will create the help and i will show

162
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:57,440
you how it works

163
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,919
so after other than that we just need to

164
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:01,120
code

165
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:03,440
right so let's go together so this is a

166
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,759
live demo

167
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:07,360
i already know kenny will say oh this is

168
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:08,880
why it takes 20 minutes because i'm very

169
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:12,080
slow to write

170
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:14,319
on my keyboard when i'm but let's

171
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,919
let's try it we're going to do it no

172
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:19,440
worries

173
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:22,639
can you read it seems so right

174
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:24,400
so the first thing uh i just set was to

175
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:27,919
have the

176
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,919
uh to download the

177
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,240
mysqlssh plugin common i downloaded it

178
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,159
earlier my machine

179
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,639
because the network i was not able to

180
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:40,639
use the wi-fi here

181
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:43,759
so you go in mysql sh dot plugin

182
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:46,880
um plugin so i mean in directory

183
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:48,800
empty one right and i will create also

184
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:53,039
here

185
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:55,120
up my extension folder

186
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:56,318
and the name of the plugin we're going

187
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:59,599
to create today

188
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:01,919
okay first then

189
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:02,880
we will go in the extension here you do

190
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:06,159
the away get

191
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:09,759
to get the the file but i will copy it

192
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,759
from my home directory

193
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:14,159
my sql sh yeah i hope you're a developer

194
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,840
and

195
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,199
it's a developer conference so i wanted

196
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:19,679
to make a bit more

197
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:21,520
uh you know some code because we haven't

198
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:25,199
discussed a lot of code today already

199
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:31,840
still right so here's the file

200
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:31,840
let's have a look what's in it let's do

201
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:37,198
so it register the plugins that you're

202
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:38,960
going to create

203
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:40,720
and this is all the information about

204
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:43,198
the type

205
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,240
so it has just this method about the

206
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:48,080
registration

207
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:51,199
and some help and that's it

208
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:52,560
so it just do the registration of the of

209
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:56,160
your uh

210
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:59,520
of your object in the of the plugin

211
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:03,039
in the shell

212
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:06,479
so after that remember

213
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:09,599
we go in uh yeah i forgot

214
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:13,840
we also need a very complicated file

215
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:13,840
i hope you will be able to follow

216
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:22,720
this one empty done that was easy

217
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:26,000
this is just pure python stuff done easy

218
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:30,240
so now we're gonna create

219
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:32,080
our init file for our uh

220
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:34,000
our module itself right for for the

221
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:37,839
plugin we are creating

222
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:41,440
so of course we can we can create

223
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:44,560
whatever we want here i always

224
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:48,240
give the name and then some comment

225
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:48,239
but we won't do that

226
00:08:50,399 --> 00:09:00,000
so we need to call mysql sh

227
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:01,680
plugins command

228
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,160
we're going to import the registration

229
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:07,359
of the plugin

230
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:10,880
which is there

231
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:14,080
plugin right

232
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:18,320
and because i know it because i

233
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:21,360
already try it you would you will also

234
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:24,399
call import some of the

235
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,839
function that you and of the all the the

236
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:28,080
elements you're going to do so usually

237
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:31,440
you do that after when you create it

238
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:34,800
but for a gain of time so i will go

239
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:37,120
in my uh in my object

240
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,079
so in my plugin first them and i want to

241
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:41,279
import

242
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:42,240
variables so it's a method inside and i

243
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:46,080
will call it

244
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:50,560
variables flag okay

245
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:54,160
and then we register everything

246
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:57,439
this is where the magic happens because

247
00:09:54,160 --> 00:10:00,160
we can give a name usually uh

248
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:03,600
even if i write python when i register

249
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:07,600
my plugin i always use the

250
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:08,880
thank you the javascript notation

251
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:12,320
notation

252
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:14,160
notation because this is easy and

253
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:16,800
after that i don't care if i call

254
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:20,399
because all the plugins that you created

255
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:21,760
you can create them as if it was

256
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:24,160
you can call them obviously to us

257
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:26,720
javascript or python

258
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,360
all the framework will abstract that for

259
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,519
you

260
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,480
so if you create everything in python

261
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:32,240
and then you call ever

262
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,600
you use everything in javascript it will

263
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:36,240
work and this is what i

264
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,240
usually do

265
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:43,839
i will copy paste because i'm very slow

266
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:46,560
and we're going to discuss what i've

267
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:52,079
done and also it will

268
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:52,079
let's see even for copy pasting i'm bad

269
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:03,200
so what i'm doing here some

270
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,160
information so here i will say okay i

271
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:07,040
will call

272
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,920
this module i've created and then i will

273
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,839
call that method

274
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:12,800
the method is get variable info and

275
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:14,880
we're going to create it together after

276
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,839
some information about it some

277
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,680
parameters

278
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:19,440
one only which is i will call it

279
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:21,599
variable what it is

280
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,279
so give some information about what type

281
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,279
is it is it required

282
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:26,640
because sometimes you can say oh i want

283
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:29,760
uh

284
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:32,800
parameters but maybe are not needed so

285
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:35,760
you can't uh say it's not required

286
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:37,599
and then the full plug-in information

287
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,399
the plugin is called fosdem and what it

288
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:41,440
does

289
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:44,480
that's it so this is just in the init

290
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:45,279
so not complicated just registered all

291
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,920
the methods

292
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:50,000
so now the real code will be in our

293
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:53,199
variable

294
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,040
variables dot bi

295
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:59,200
so here is where we're going to create

296
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:59,199
the code so first thing to do

297
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:06,239
we just import mysql sh so mysql shell

298
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:08,320
module

299
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,720
to be able to make all the course we

300
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:13,760
need then we create

301
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:15,360
our our

302
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,800
method the only method we're going to

303
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:21,360
use in this

304
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:24,560
plugin which is get variables info

305
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,120
the parameters we we give and some

306
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,839
session

307
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,240
if we want to add but usually we don't

308
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:30,639
uh

309
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,279
we leave it at none and if there is we

310
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:33,680
check here

311
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:34,959
because we get from the global shell if

312
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:38,560
we are connected

313
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:40,079
to a to a mysql server

314
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:42,800
we're going to use that connection to do

315
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:43,439
it if not we can we could create one but

316
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,439
here

317
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,720
is we use the one we are created and if

318
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:49,600
not it will complain

319
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:51,200
i will not create one in my in my plugin

320
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,560
but it's possible that you could do that

321
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:56,560
if you want

322
00:12:52,560 --> 00:13:00,000
when you have created that the magic

323
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:01,518
let's call it like that or the only code

324
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,320
complicated in this case

325
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:05,519
it's the query so i want to find that

326
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:08,399
information for

327
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:09,360
information schema right and then play

328
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:11,279
with uh

329
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,600
the output and show it to the to the

330
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:13,600
people

331
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:21,279
and then it's just some python

332
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:24,560
processing this information right

333
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:28,240
so what we do so we do the

334
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:30,719
sql we check if we got some information

335
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,519
we can also use wildcard so if i

336
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,279
searching for

337
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:35,279
some variable with the workout name he

338
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:36,480
will say oh i found at least three

339
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:38,399
variables that match

340
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,600
the query you are looking for and then

341
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:42,800
for each of them

342
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:44,000
i'm looking if these are the default

343
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:46,000
when it's compiled

344
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,079
are they being changed by the session

345
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,079
are they being changed as a global

346
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:51,839
are they being persisted because in

347
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:53,760
mysql 8 you can purchase variable

348
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:56,560
without modifying the mycnf

349
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:57,519
all that information we can see it and

350
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:00,719
that's it

351
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:04,000
and the plugin is created very

352
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:05,920
so very small files and yeah you don't

353
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,880
see maybe at the end

354
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:11,439
and not nothing else every time i will

355
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:14,560
run the shell

356
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:17,839
right so let's connect to

357
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,839
my machine

358
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:24,800
you see so yeah let's see

359
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:26,079
can you see the at the back here so i'm

360
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,319
connected to my machine

361
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:29,279
if you have some error here like you

362
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,279
make a

363
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:32,800
syntax error or typo you will have an

364
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:35,120
error message that tells you

365
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:37,120
thank you that tells you that you need

366
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:39,040
to check in the error lock of the law

367
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,880
of the mysql shell it shows you where it

368
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:43,839
is to find what's going on because

369
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,639
you may have created some syntax error

370
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:47,680
or whatever

371
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:50,959
so i wrote the shell my plugin in

372
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:54,079
python like i said right but i can also

373
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:54,560
call it you see yeah you don't see

374
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:56,479
because

375
00:14:54,560 --> 00:15:00,000
let's see if i can make it i will make

376
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:02,720
it shorter here if i find my mouse

377
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,720
so it will be

378
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:13,680
better for you so extension

379
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:17,760
the tab it says fosdem

380
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:20,160
tab the the method i have for it

381
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:22,959
which are get variables or help i can

382
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,959
also do this

383
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:28,079
and it gives me that info i am in

384
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:31,359
javascript i can

385
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:34,638
go in python and call

386
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,639
exactly the same way

387
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:41,120
and now you can see the information the

388
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:42,160
the call here the syntax of the name of

389
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,000
the function

390
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:47,759
is not exactly the same because it takes

391
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:50,320
the default python syntax right

392
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:51,040
so let's try to see what what happens to

393
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,839
that

394
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:55,199
so first with the help it gives me oh

395
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:57,279
you have a plugin now

396
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:58,639
this is all the plugins i had on the

397
00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:01,120
machine i did the test

398
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:03,120
and you have also the fosdem demo test

399
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:06,160
then for fosdem itself you can have

400
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:07,920
help again you don't have to code that

401
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:09,759
all the framework the mysql shell

402
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:11,439
framework gives you that

403
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:12,880
and then you have information also for

404
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,839
all the methods that you have in your

405
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:18,880
plugin

406
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:21,519
and when we test it so i want to test

407
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:24,000
default find a variable called default

408
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:24,000
with the

409
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:28,160
the wildcard and plugin if on one

410
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,560
variable

411
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:31,600
it gives you the name and it says okay

412
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:34,160
this was

413
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,199
mysql native password and it's global

414
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:38,319
and it was

415
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:39,599
set in etc my cnf so this is the

416
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,880
information that you got from this

417
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,279
plugin

418
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:44,560
another one bin lock format he said okay

419
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:47,360
i found one variable

420
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:48,239
the name is bin lock format the row is

421
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,480
set to row

422
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:52,160
it has been persisted where is it

423
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:54,639
persisted you have the file

424
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:55,360
and as it is was persisted it tells you

425
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:58,320
also

426
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:59,600
okay it's root i'd look at lost that the

427
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:03,040
12th of april

428
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:05,280
did that persist information

429
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:06,720
so the shell it's very nice to use the

430
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:09,839
shell for

431
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:13,120
dbas or junior dbas so the

432
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:16,639
senior dba can create plenty of function

433
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:19,359
plenty of plugins to help the junior dba

434
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:21,360
to do their job easily without because

435
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:23,918
here it's a very easy one to show you

436
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:25,599
in a very little amount of time but you

437
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:28,880
can do that

438
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:32,000
much more complicated to find and i have

439
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:34,320
plenty of them to already available

440
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,600
and pull requests are welcome also but i

441
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,918
will show you after

442
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:39,439
the github three so when there is

443
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:41,520
multiple variables

444
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,559
it also works like that and it gives you

445
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,879
every time

446
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:47,280
what's the value if it was the default

447
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:49,760
value if it was compiled or not

448
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:52,160
you will get all that information so the

449
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:53,760
pull requests are welcome

450
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,280
pull requests or feature requests

451
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:57,520
because i like i said

452
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,799
the most complicated for me was the id

453
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:02,559
so if you have ids

454
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:08,160
to improve the shell just let me know

455
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:08,160
put it there and thank you that's it for

456
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:18,000
me i really invite you to go

457
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:19,120
check that guitar repo because we will

458
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,440
see very

459
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:23,439
cool plugins that took more than 20

460
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:29,840
minutes to write

461
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:29,840
that can be very useful thank you

462
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:43,840
yeah don't go away i will give goodies

463
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:43,840
too late
