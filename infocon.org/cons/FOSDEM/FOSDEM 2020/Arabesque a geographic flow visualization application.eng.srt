1
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,840
okay i'm here today to speak about the

2
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:12,160
arabesque project

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,440
which is a geographical flow

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:17,198
visualization

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:20,400
application it's a web application

6
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:22,640
i will try to keep that schedule

7
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,959
speaking of a global project which

8
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:28,080
called jflovis

9
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:31,599
speak about the application we developed

10
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:35,120
and try to make a demonstration

11
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:38,640
and speak about the future we see

12
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:40,559
so far so the the arab

13
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,960
application is part of the jeffy's

14
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:42,959
project

15
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:49,920
which aims to uh

16
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:52,879
two things gather informations on

17
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,920
uh web mapping application dedicated to

18
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:56,960
uh

19
00:00:53,920 --> 00:01:00,160
special temporal mobilities and flow

20
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:03,280
visualization to get insight of what's

21
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:05,679
is existing what are the features

22
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,119
um the pros and cons of each

23
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,960
applications

24
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:10,640
and from that uh develop a web

25
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:14,000
application for uh

26
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:18,000
flow generalization visualizations

27
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
of flows networks and movements

28
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:22,400
there is a website you can go it's a

29
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,720
blog

30
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,439
research blog so we can check but it's

31
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:29,200
in french

32
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:32,639
for knows but we try to um

33
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:35,200
push it to english uh sooner

34
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,640
there is a talk i gave at the fourth

35
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,880
fortress conference last year

36
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,880
in bucharest so if you want more

37
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:44,240
information to

38
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:48,640
about the j florid's project in itself

39
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:48,640
you can go check it on the web

40
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:54,559
so let's speak about arabesque in

41
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:57,920
details

42
00:01:54,560 --> 00:02:00,000
so it's like i said arabic is an

43
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:03,280
application but it's dedicated to

44
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,399
a certain kind of data it's for

45
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:10,720
flow and networks

46
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:12,879
data only it was made by a

47
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:15,760
group of researchers in geography

48
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:18,959
computer visions

49
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:21,359
mostly from the university gustavel

50
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,640
and the cnrs research center which is a

51
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,959
french

52
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,679
national research center and several

53
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:29,680
labs from

54
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,680
the national research center

55
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:41,440
so it's a timid

56
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:45,040
application it's available at this url

57
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:46,160
which is arbesc.ifta if there was a

58
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,640
research

59
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:50,319
comp is the research component of the

60
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:54,000
gustav ethel but it was

61
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:57,119
it disappeared when the gustav uh

62
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,680
was created in the third of january this

63
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,040
year

64
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:04,640
so it's pretty new and everything is not

65
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:08,079
working with the new um

66
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:10,480
is a new name so this url is still

67
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,120
working it's the source code is

68
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,720
available

69
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:17,840
available on github with a bsd to close

70
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:20,080
license we use

71
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:22,640
of course open source libraries mostly

72
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:26,080
web libraries like open layers

73
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:29,760
or d3gs turf for

74
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:31,040
data only and so we provide some data

75
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:34,159
sets to work with

76
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:37,359
and to play with the application so

77
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:40,480
it comes mostly from natural love or

78
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:43,040
openstreetmap or custom datasets we

79
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:46,480
found online

80
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:50,640
so we divide the application in five

81
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:53,679
major steps like importing data the

82
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:56,720
one the most important thing for us is

83
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:59,840
to be able to import all data in it so

84
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:03,599
you provide these capabilities

85
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:06,239
it's links and or nodes

86
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:07,200
like i said it's networks and flow

87
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,159
multiple

88
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,599
visualization flow data so when you need

89
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:15,120
athlete links

90
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:18,159
and maybe not we provide some

91
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:21,199
statistical treatments we aiming to

92
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,400
add more in the future you can explore

93
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:25,440
and filter

94
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:28,799
your data directly in the application

95
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:33,759
you also can be you are able to also to

96
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,759
symbolize your data to make a pretty map

97
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:41,040
and save and export

98
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:44,638
so the interface is quite simple there

99
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:48,479
is a middle panel which is the map

100
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:49,360
which it shows you uh the left panel is

101
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:53,680
more for

102
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:58,080
projection handling adding layers and

103
00:04:53,680 --> 00:05:01,120
uh administration stuff

104
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:05,120
and the left is the right panel is

105
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:06,960
much more about um data manipulation and

106
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:10,000
not only

107
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:13,919
i will detail those but you can

108
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:18,080
also hide the side panels to get

109
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:21,599
only the map or play with it by default

110
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,599
arabesque when you load data

111
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:27,680
makes a default symbology and takes only

112
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:30,960
the tense

113
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:34,320
the tense more meaningful

114
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:38,479
information so for example we only keep

115
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:41,599
on this data set 10

116
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:44,800
of the information of the lengths but it

117
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:47,759
gave us 83 percent

118
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,759
of the volume

119
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,720
okay so let's skip sometimes for the

120
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:58,960
demo

121
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,960
so this is not working pretty well

122
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,400
yeah but

123
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:09,039
we need to if i want to see what i

124
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,039
am doing here

125
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:23,599
okay

126
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:27,680
yes so i can see as well

127
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:30,960
okay uh we will be playing today with

128
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:32,880
the ricardo data set which is an

129
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:37,039
historical data set

130
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:40,639
on trades between countries

131
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:43,759
it was provided by the media

132
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:46,080
media lab research lab

133
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:47,440
it's a political research lab in censor

134
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:50,719
paris

135
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:54,960
if you if you have been here

136
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:58,880
yesterday there was paul jiren which is

137
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,880
responsible for this data set

138
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,030
you can have information of course it's

139
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,280
in

140
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:06,638
[Music]

141
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:08,559
open source licenses

142
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:12,160
so it's in french for now because we

143
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,160
make a presentation in france

144
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:17,520
so the data set are available on github

145
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,599
as well so

146
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,280
the code source is available of the

147
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:21,840
arabic application is available on

148
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:25,198
github

149
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,198
in the jflovis

150
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:32,400
organization and

151
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:35,280
the sergio ricardo data set is provided

152
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,280
also as well

153
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:43,599
so i already downloaded on my computer

154
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:46,800
to save sometimes it's it's a

155
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:49,919
small data set so this is painful

156
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:53,599
so the application uh the first panel

157
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:55,120
shows you oh can you directly auto load

158
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:59,520
data

159
00:07:55,120 --> 00:08:02,560
but if you want to use a gmo before that

160
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:04,560
you can scroll down and get access to uh

161
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,879
the two demos we made available

162
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,680
like bike sharing in london so you can

163
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:10,960
see it's

164
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:13,520
a local

165
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,479
data set pretty much local and swiss

166
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:18,240
commuting also

167
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:20,960
it's more bigger scale and uh

168
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,400
the ricardo data set we are we we will

169
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:24,080
be using today

170
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,758
is a worldwide data set so the

171
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:28,560
applications scales

172
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:30,240
automatically on your data you only

173
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,730
provide data on

174
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:35,599
wgs 84

175
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:37,120
[Music]

176
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:41,360
it's on the projection the reference

177
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:44,080
systems yes

178
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:46,880
and everything works in in that

179
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:48,320
reference system

180
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:50,480
in the application you can change the

181
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:53,440
projection to a local one if you want

182
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,480
i will show you something here there is

183
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:58,320
a gallery

184
00:08:54,480 --> 00:09:01,760
you made for screenshot to see

185
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:03,920
some reason realization

186
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:06,399
and some information about the

187
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:09,279
projection

188
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:11,760
the funding the the team the

189
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:16,560
contributors

190
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:21,200
and some links some user useful links

191
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:24,479
so if you click on explore by chain

192
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,480
oop it's not working

193
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:41,279
okay so if you click click

194
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:44,320
on the demo it should load uh

195
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:48,320
i had an issue with the layering

196
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:53,600
but it's okay um

197
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:53,600
let's go back sorry to the arabesque

198
00:09:54,800 --> 00:10:02,000
and see how we can uh load data

199
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:03,760
so as we can i said before we need two

200
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,640
kinds of data

201
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,640
nodes and links

202
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:16,320
let's load the links we called it edges

203
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:19,440
in this data set so i click on browse

204
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:21,760
get a look to the data

205
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,040
and uh we need to provide some

206
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:26,560
information on it

207
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:28,160
like the origin id and the destination

208
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:31,279
id

209
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:32,640
because each point needs an id each

210
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:35,920
cities or

211
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:38,959
starting point is an id

212
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:41,439
the volume is the

213
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:43,279
quantity you want to represent it might

214
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:46,000
be people it might be

215
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:47,760
goods everything you want anything you

216
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,200
want

217
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:54,800
i want to import a location

218
00:10:51,200 --> 00:11:01,120
and of course i have an issue

219
00:10:54,800 --> 00:11:04,880
so let me start again

220
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:07,760
okay destination volume

221
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:08,880
so we we also provide aggregation

222
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:13,360
functions

223
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:16,000
like sum mean median max so

224
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:17,040
you can choose which aggregation you

225
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
want

226
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:20,000
let's keep the sum

227
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:27,120
okay it's fixed so now i need to

228
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:31,439
load some nodes so i will be recording

229
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:34,880
loading the nodes that are

230
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:38,320
and the id are the same for our

231
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:39,200
locations the origin id and destination

232
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:43,440
ids

233
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:44,000
okay so the application will be able to

234
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:47,040
link

235
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:50,320
things uh to each other

236
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:51,680
so it's in lat long of course like i

237
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:55,040
said it's in

238
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:58,079
wgs 84

239
00:11:55,040 --> 00:12:00,639
and uh the application

240
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:01,680
already makes a cleaning first time you

241
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:04,720
load something

242
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,519
if the nodes uh are not linking to

243
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,320
something else

244
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:09,600
or if you you can find something it will

245
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,639
remove it

246
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:16,800
so first step of cleaning

247
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:16,800
is already done by the application

248
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:20,880
okay and then you have something it's

249
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:24,000
not

250
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:25,040
pretty but it's already something you

251
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,800
have

252
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:32,000
already a representation of your data

253
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,319
and then you can work with it so like

254
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,360
this

255
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,760
it's just nodes and links in colors not

256
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,880
very

257
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:40,560
uh it's a little bit meaningless

258
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,920
you know you don't know where the things

259
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:45,760
are

260
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:48,319
so let's add a new layer um

261
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:50,720
we have you provide we provide some base

262
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:55,120
layers

263
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:57,470
so in add layers we can add countries

264
00:12:55,120 --> 00:13:00,559
let's keep the feeling a little bit

265
00:12:57,470 --> 00:13:00,559
[Music]

266
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:08,399
pale and the stroke

267
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:12,399
a little bit stronger so we can

268
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:12,399
change the symbology quite easily

269
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:21,920
and then we have a context

270
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:25,279
okay so it's still a little bit too

271
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:28,479
uh too messy to work with

272
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:31,279
but you can have a context so let's uh

273
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:32,639
remove this panel to give the map a

274
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:36,480
little bit

275
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:39,839
more space and

276
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:44,160
we can work with the links

277
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:47,120
so let's say we want

278
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,120
a square root

279
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:54,720
formula to give the size

280
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,719
and change a little bit the ratio

281
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:06,000
no the information is a little bit more

282
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:08,399
clear so you can see the big big

283
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,360
exchange have been between europe and

284
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:13,519
usa

285
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:16,560
mostly uh the uk and there is some

286
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:16,959
other exchanges so you can work like

287
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:20,000
this

288
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:20,000
use different kind of

289
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:28,079
rules to do that you can add things if

290
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,079
you don't want the node you can hide

291
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:36,079
them

292
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:36,079
okay uh you can change of course the

293
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,720
divergent palette

294
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:49,680
for example nodes you can find uh

295
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:52,240
change the size on the balance

296
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:53,199
and apply your coloring say okay it's

297
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:58,000
this country

298
00:14:53,199 --> 00:15:00,800
is giving more or giving less

299
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,320
you can use a degree or it's connected

300
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:05,599
to

301
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:07,839
a numbers of other cities or other

302
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:10,880
countries or its countries

303
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:13,199
so in degrees out degrees so

304
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,399
there is already those kind of

305
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:19,359
connections for

306
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:19,360
network visitation available

307
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:30,160
okay let's see balance

308
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:32,880
it's not working let's get back to

309
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,880
something more

310
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:42,560
okay have a bug

311
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:58,480
it's demo time so i have an issue

312
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:58,479
it's okay should be okay

313
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:02,800
let's start again a small

314
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:14,079
destination for location and again this

315
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:14,079
error this is an error we already

316
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:20,839
get knowledge about but didn't fix yet

317
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:22,160
we need to dig a little bit to find the

318
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:27,120
cause oh

319
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:27,120
it's a volume okay

320
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:34,079
the idea is the id and that long isn't

321
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,079
that long

322
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:42,000
okay same okay let's get back to

323
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:42,000
uh more

324
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:51,839
okay add layers paste

325
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:57,279
stroke let's see

326
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:05,439
okay we just reduce

327
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:08,319
uh the ratio

328
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:08,319
by 100

329
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:16,839
okay okay let's just

330
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:18,160
change the ratio so we have a less messy

331
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:21,119
map

332
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:21,919
i said we can also provide filters you

333
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:25,039
can filter

334
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:27,439
your data on some information let's say

335
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:31,760
we don't just want

336
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:35,039
the small actions or we just want

337
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:37,440
the biggest one so okay

338
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:39,280
the data set is like that so it's the

339
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:42,480
big ones are just

340
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:45,918
uk to us but you

341
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:46,720
you can add more filters maybe you want

342
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:49,600
to filter

343
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,600
on your links

344
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,799
and just show

345
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:58,400
let me think if it's category call

346
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:02,240
remember

347
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:04,400
if you want only

348
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,400
the

349
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:11,440
the exchange in the

350
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,440
first half

351
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:19,520
of the 20th century you can do that

352
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:22,559
and let's say okay i want

353
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,559
all the data

354
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,960
and you can have that so you can filter

355
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:30,480
all your data

356
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:32,720
right in the application how many times

357
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,720
left

358
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,640
yeah okay so you can add a little more

359
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:38,880
filter

360
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:41,360
each time you have the percentage of the

361
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:44,960
information represents

362
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:48,479
uh it's available on the

363
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:51,360
uh arabic dot ifstar.fr

364
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:52,960
url and let's go back to the

365
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:57,199
presentation

366
00:18:52,960 --> 00:19:00,960
which should be yeah

367
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:02,960
let's talk about the future so

368
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:04,160
for the future in coming year we're

369
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:08,000
planning to rewrite

370
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:08,000
the code base so this is the first

371
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:13,760
release and there is some bugs still

372
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:15,600
and we want to add new features but

373
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:17,679
before that we want to rewrite

374
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:20,399
we make a viable product something

375
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:22,799
working but before adding new things

376
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:24,720
more stuff we want to make it more

377
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:27,200
stronger and

378
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:28,080
make the maintenance more easy so we

379
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:31,280
need to re

380
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:32,320
rewrite a little bit uh the the code

381
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:35,200
base

382
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:37,678
and after that we will provide new

383
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:41,840
features like new indicators

384
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:45,520
new filters try to work with bipartite

385
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:48,879
data set which is not possible

386
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:52,320
for now and for now you can export

387
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:54,880
i didn't show you that

388
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:56,480
feature that you can only export to an

389
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:59,760
image to a png file

390
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:03,760
so we want to provide the

391
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:08,080
vector format export so you can easily

392
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:11,280
rework in sk inkscape afterward

393
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:12,559
and that's it for me if you want to try

394
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:15,280
to connect to me

395
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:17,840
this one is working for now this was not

396
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,840
working yet

397
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:24,480
