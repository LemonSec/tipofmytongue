00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:10,160
but i would like to introduce

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:11,840
felix who went from

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,519
a high school and college dropout to

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:16,640
working as a web developer

5
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:19,439
at several bay area startups and then at

6
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,720
fosterm 2019 he was presenting some of

7
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:22,960
his open source work

8
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:24,560
related to quantum computing which led

9
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,119
to his current gig as a

10
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:28,640
quantum software engineer at ionq which

11
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:32,000
is a trapped ion based

12
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:33,600
quantum computing startup in washington

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,600
and the quantum open source projects

14
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,559
he's working on include cubac

15
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,680
which is a debugger for quantum programs

16
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:41,440
and quill json

17
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,800

18
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,280
quantum computing hardware

19
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,540
and control systems so please welcome

20
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:51,130
felix

21
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:51,129
[Applause]

22
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:59,680
hey what's up um so i work at

23
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,320
a quantum hardware startup we don't have

24
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,640
anything

25
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:05,360
open source but i've worked enough on

26
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,600
hardware that i could tell you feasibly

27
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,799
how to put together an open source

28
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,919
quantum computer

29
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:13,040
using purely open source components and

30
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,600
software

31
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,040
so this is a survey of what there is out

32
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,000
there in the field and what it takes to

33
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,520
put them together

34
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,520
to have your own quantum computer

35
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:26,000
um in my talk i'm going to go over what

36
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:27,520
goes into a quantum computer

37
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,520
we're going to be talking specifically

38
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:31,360
about trapped ion

39
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,200
and we're going to actually go through

40
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,799
and get all the parts we need to build

41
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,400
it and i'm going to have links to the

42
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,479
relevant githubs

43
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,799
and i'm going to talk about the state of

44
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:43,759
the open source quantum computer like

45
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,320
what do we have what needs improvement

46
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:46,079
um

47
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:49,439
what is the vision for the open source

48
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:52,720
quantum computer et cetera

49
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:54,559
so what goes into a quantum computer

50
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,079
in general what are we gonna need to do

51
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,479
to build this thing

52
00:01:56,079 --> 00:02:00,240
um i'm talking about trapped ion there

53
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:01,600
are various varieties of quantum

54
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,520
computing hardware

55
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,960
um trapped on is what i know best

56
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,119
because it's what my company makes

57
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,079
and i also think it's the best candidate

58
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:10,800
for

59
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:13,280
a for your own open source quantum

60
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,520
computer just because trapped ion

61
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,040
you can use a lot of off-the-shelf parts

62
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,200
and there's lots of reasons for that

63
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,160
it's a little slower so you need less

64
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,119
hardware and

65
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,680
software can control more of it um and

66
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,200
it's not

67
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,720
you don't have to build a sophisticated

68
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,160
circuit like you would in

69
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,160
other models of quantum computing so

70
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,280
it's relatively accessible to us

71
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,599
as we're trying to build the quantum

72
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:36,879
computer in our garage with only open

73
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:39,599
source parts

74
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:41,518
the phases of running a quantum program

75
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:43,200
in a trapdown quantum computer so it's

76
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:43,519
like all the tasks we're going to need

77
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,160
us

78
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:48,000
we're going to need to do first we have

79
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:50,640
a bunch of atoms

80
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,160
and they need to be loaded so we have

81
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,839
our atoms they're going to

82
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,280
act as kind of like the memory of a

83
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,560
quantum computer

84
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:00,800
um they get put into an electric

85
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,680
field and they kind of hover and that's

86
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,040
to

87
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,920
so they're not touching anything they're

88
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:08,239
isolated we know exactly where they are

89
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,839
and they go through state preparation so

90
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:13,040
they're ready to be used as

91
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,959
qubits i'm not going to go into

92
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,560
too much i think some of the quantum

93
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,159
information concepts will be covered by

94
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,920
other speakers in this track

95
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:22,399
but basically we need to get them like

96
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,920
ready then we go through a coherent

97
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,959
phase where we're actually running the

98
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,359
quantum program

99
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:29,280
and so for us we're kind of sketching

100
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,360
into the atoms using lasers

101
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,120
the program so we have lasers but

102
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,480
they're getting modulated they're

103
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,080
changing over time

104
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,319
um so it's not as simple as just

105
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:40,720
shooting lasers and an ion they need to

106
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:42,560
the laser pulses actually change kind of

107
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:45,120
like a synthesizer

108
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,480
um then we go through detection where we

109
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,799
see

110
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,000
the result of our computation so for us

111
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:54,400
detection is

112
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:57,599
which ions emit photons and which don't

113
00:03:54,400 --> 00:04:00,080
um this is generally kind of what it

114
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:02,238
looks like to be in a trap to be an ion

115
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,920
that's suspended you have a rotating

116
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:04,959
electric potential and you're kind of

117
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,760
suspended

118
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:09,040
so this gives us a kind of a clue about

119
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,720
the complexity

120
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,640
of this electric field that we're going

121
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,359
to produce it's always rotating it needs

122
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,320
to be

123
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,919
very specifically orientated towards our

124
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,159
ions

125
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:21,039
so a lot of hardware a lot of software

126
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,560
goes into

127
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:27,759
crafting the electric field

128
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:30,800
this is felix's crash course

129
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:32,960
to atomic physics um

130
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,400
hoping to do my physicists proud but

131
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,799
probably not going to

132
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,880
um basically what we're looking at is

133
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:42,479
the different states of an ion here

134
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:43,120
the black bars are kind of like i was

135
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:45,199
talking about

136
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,560
we want them to produce a photon or not

137
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:48,720
we have the uh

138
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,320
various parts of the atomic manifold

139
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,240
those are the black bars we see over

140
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:56,080
there the p's and the s's

141
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:58,400
etc and basically if you're in a p

142
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:00,159
you're gonna glow you're in a glowy

143
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,919
state you're in an s you're in a dark

144
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,639
state you're not gonna produce an atom

145
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:06,719
and the arrows between them are lasers

146
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:08,320
so we use lasers to take in between the

147
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:12,320
various states

148
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:13,520
um and the number near those bars of the

149
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,680
frequency the laser

150
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:17,840
so the takeaway here is that in order to

151
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,759
actually change the state of the atoms

152
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:21,039
um our computer we need a lot of

153
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:23,600
different lasers

154
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:25,360
um and they're also the atom is still

155
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,320
kind of a complicated place there's lots

156
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,320
of states that we

157
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:30,000
don't care about and they're dangerous

158
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:32,560
to the functioning of our computer so we

159
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,840
need to control it very precisely

160
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:38,720
that's kind of the takeaway of the slide

161
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:40,000
so why do we want to build an open

162
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,840
source quantum computer

163
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,080
is that our final slide after i've gone

164
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:47,119
through how one might go about doing it

165
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:49,359
um i think my motivation is to

166
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:51,120
empower the self-learner or kind of like

167
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,320
the undergraduate getting into quantum

168
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,240
computer

169
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,840
um quantum computing famously the

170
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,039
hardware is like very restricted and

171
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,880
non-socialized

172
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:00,159
and i think if we had an open source

173
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,120
quantum computer something you could

174
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,600
easily build

175
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,120
and people were regularly interacting

176
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,080
with small quantum computers it would do

177
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,199
a lot to unlock

178
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:11,198
the intellectual capital of the field um

179
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:13,520
so i think it's it's worthwhile thinking

180
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:14,880
about at least

181
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,758
okay so now we're actually going to

182
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:22,000
build it with stuff we find just

183
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:24,080
on github and an open source generally

184
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,360
for the loading we're going to need to

185
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,400
do several different things we're going

186
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,919
to need to

187
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,599
something that can shape an electric

188
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:30,639
field we're going to need software that

189
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,840
can

190
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:34,400
model and solve for electric fields

191
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:38,080
there's

192
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:40,000
there's lots going on so first

193
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,680
thing we have to do is we're storing the

194
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
atom somewhere and we have an

195
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,919
oven which is going to ionize and

196
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,039
release them

197
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:50,400
so for an oven you can actually use

198
00:06:48,039 --> 00:06:53,599
qiti's oven controller

199
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,479
this is freely open source hardware it

200
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:56,719
has

201
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:58,240
as code as schematics actually has data

202
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:02,080
sheets and documentation

203
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:06,160
so very thorough

204
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:06,159
oven control are freely available to us

205
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,239
for loading software this is what's

206
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,840
actually going to control

207
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:15,360
releasing the atoms and putting them

208
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:17,359
into the electric field we can use the

209
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,560
sandia's quantum operating system ion

210
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,840
control has a

211
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:23,520
auto load plug-in that

212
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,280
hooks into several off-the-shelf

213
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,840
components and could actually work with

214
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:30,960
our oven controller

215
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:33,039
and sandia's iron control

216
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,318
has a lot of documentation there's a lot

217
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:36,240
of support

218
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:37,919
it's very thorough code based so this

219
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,160
does again pretty much everything you

220
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:43,198
need in terms of that

221
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:45,599
this is a picture of the actual trap

222
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:46,800
there's a vacuum chamber and the thing

223
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:50,719
in the middle

224
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,280
is a trap chip so the trap chip is

225
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,960
probably

226
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,799
is the least open source part of this

227
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:57,280
because it's a very customized chip

228
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,000
and there's no open source hardware for

229
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:01,758
it

230
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,199
um and this is what's responsible when

231
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:04,639
combined with other electronic

232
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:07,360
components for creating the electric

233
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:09,680
field that suspends our

234
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,840
atoms so at this point we have we've

235
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,520
loaded our atoms in they're ionized and

236
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:15,359
they're in the trap

237
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,039
for the trap chip this is what we have

238
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:20,160
available in terms of open source

239
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:22,400
there's no schematics and models for

240
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,199
a specific trap chip that you can run

241
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,919
out there

242
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:28,479
but their software to make them um from

243
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:31,520
berkeley's trapped iron group

244
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:33,519
the gen trap and the trap design testing

245
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,718
station is the bare minimum you need to

246
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:37,120
kind of figure out

247
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:38,880
how to like model and make your trap

248
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,719
chip

249
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:42,479
trap chip is still kind of a custom and

250
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:44,320
bespoke so you can't

251
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:46,320
just go out to like a commodity

252
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,000
electronics store and make your own trap

253
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:50,480
but it's as good as it's going to get

254
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,800
for open source trap ship making

255
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:55,519
except if a good samaritan wants to

256
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:58,640
flesh out the trap chip software scene

257
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:59,920
um i went through these repos and they

258
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,120
could definitely use a little more

259
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:03,199
documentation

260
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:05,120
um as i said before some pre-made

261
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:08,880
schematics and the

262
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:11,040
trap models would be good but you know

263
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:13,600
it's possible we could maybe make our

264
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:16,000
own open source trap chip

265
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,760
um for generating trap fields we have to

266
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,920
have software that actually

267
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,040
controls the chip and remember that we

268
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,079
need to like there's some very

269
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,079
complicated physics

270
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,160
going on and it's very dependent on the

271
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,399
atom we're using how many atoms we want

272
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:30,079
to

273
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:30,800
load um i found through berkeley's trap

274
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:34,080
down group

275
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:35,920
q sim and another trap simulator

276
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,600
to electrode and so this is the software

277
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:41,040
that actually gives us

278
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:42,480
um the data we load our trap chip with

279
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,319
to create the electric the exact

280
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,959
electric field we need

281
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,240
um in combination with kind of the

282
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:51,359
software that actually like

283
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:54,399
will create a waveform uh

284
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:57,120
we need hardware to actually uh

285
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:57,920
that can change electric potential very

286
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,279
quickly

287
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:05,920
so that's called the trap deck

288
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:09,120
and from mlabs there's the the zotino

289
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:09,599
it's a like 32-channel electronic trap

290
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,800
chip

291
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,680
um and a faster one called fastino which

292
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:17,279
i thought was

293
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:20,800
pretty funny um

294
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:22,880
so yeah this is uh again this is

295
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:24,000
more thoroughly documented than some of

296
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:26,320
the other open source

297
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,160
quantum computer parts we've seen um and

298
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,120
it's complete so we have drivers we have

299
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,040
hardware

300
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:33,839
and we have physics software for doing

301
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,839
everything we need here

302
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,720
and this is camera footage of a loaded

303
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,160
trap chance this is what it looks like

304
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:43,600
they're all suspended

305
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:46,240
they're all close together even spacing

306
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:49,920
we call this a crystal because the chain

307
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,920
of ions moves this one unit

308
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:56,320
um and so what we used to record that

309
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:57,920
chain is actually a camera and camera is

310
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,839
a big part of

311
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,199
the trapdown quantum computer experience

312
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:03,040
you need to like be able to see your

313
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:06,079
ions to see if they've loaded

314
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,959
you can use cameras to see if ions are

315
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:09,839
glowing

316
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:11,839
for detection um and there's no open

317
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:12,880
source hardware for cameras but there is

318
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:15,760
a dry there for

319
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:17,439
an off-the-shelf camera component from

320
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:21,040
oxford

321
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:23,680
so so far we're missing

322
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:25,120
open source camera and we don't have

323
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:28,800
everything we need from the trap chip

324
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:31,839
but we've covered loading for our actual

325
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:33,599
lasers this is the part

326
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:37,279
of the quantum computer that actually

327
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:39,040
writes our program into our trap

328
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:41,519
what we need is to create really

329
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:44,640
customized laser pulses a synthesizer as

330
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:44,640
i've alluded to before

331
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:49,360
you need dds which is an electronic

332
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,680
component that can actually

333
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:53,120
output an analog signal and if you have

334
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:56,239
enough dds you can

335
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:58,000
just mix them together and more or less

336
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,920
do everything you need to for our simple

337
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,360
trap down computer

338
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,599
there's another electronic component

339
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:05,200
called the awg arbitrary waveform

340
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:08,000
generator that can create

341
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,920
literally any kind of waveform so you

342
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,639
need this for more sophisticated gates

343
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:13,439
for

344
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:14,800
like create entanglement between ions

345
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,200
but

346
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:19,040
it's not not super necessary for just a

347
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:21,519
garage setup or something that students

348
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,519
are going to use

349
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,360
and then you have laser diodes the laser

350
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,040
diodes are at the very end they actually

351
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,480
output the laser and they get connected

352
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:30,079
to all the other electronics we've been

353
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,440
talking about that are just responsible

354
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:34,160
for creating some signal

355
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:35,120
some like like a synthesized sound

356
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,360
signal basically

357
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:39,040
um and the diodes are at the end of this

358
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:42,320
they aren't open source but they're just

359
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:45,920
a mechanical component so who cares

360
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:48,639
um dds so

361
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:50,479
four open source dds's again berkeley

362
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:52,240
strap iron lab is very

363
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,920
prolific contributors to our open source

364
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:57,040
chapter on computer so far

365
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:59,439
uh have a driver and the actual

366
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,800
schematics and everything we need for

367
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,880
dds

368
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:04,000
this is also like everything berkeley

369
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:07,279
does well

370
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:09,680
documented and conceivably looks like it

371
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:11,839
could work

372
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:13,120
not guaranteed here i have not gone

373
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:14,240
through and tried everything from

374
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:18,240
berkeley but

375
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:22,160
it looks legit it's my assessment

376
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,959
um for the awg like with the camera

377
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:26,800
there is no

378
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:28,880
open source awg hardware out there um

379
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:31,040
arctic i went through and looked at

380
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:32,399
mlabs which is a group that has a lot of

381
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,399
open source hardware

382
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:36,320
and they have one called sonara which

383
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:37,700
might be open source

384
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,519
but

385
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:41,040
[Music]

386
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:43,440
it did not have anything in the repo

387
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,639
when i looked at it just documentation

388
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:47,920
[Music]

389
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:48,399
from sandia's ion control we have driver

390
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,479
for

391
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:51,920
off-the-shelf awgs the ones that you

392
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:54,560
could just buy at a store

393
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:56,240
um you have software that controls them

394
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:58,000
so we're covered in that sense at least

395
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:00,399
you could in your garage

396
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,680
iron computer buy one at a store and

397
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:03,199
then you have the software you need to

398
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:06,479
control it

399
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:08,719
so status at the end of this is that we

400
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,440
have no open source hardware for awg but

401
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:13,040
we can

402
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:15,040
we can do it still possible so far

403
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:16,480
we've run into a few minor speed bumps

404
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,800
but we're well on our way to having

405
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:22,480
everything we need to run this computer

406
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:24,399
um so we have we have the capability to

407
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:27,440
produce any kind of pulse we want

408
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:28,160
but i'm for instance a high school

409
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,720
dropout

410
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:32,319
and i failed calculus so how are we

411
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,199
going to create the pulses we need to

412
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:36,399
actually run

413
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:38,399
quantum gates um we need pole solver

414
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:40,560
software we need physicists to say

415
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:41,760
what do you want to do this is the pulse

416
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,359
you need to generate and then we can

417
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:46,079
just put in our awg

418
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,959
easy there's no package for doing that

419
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:49,359
though

420
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:52,160
it's very dependent on your ion and your

421
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:53,519
atom that you're using

422
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:56,319
there's nothing out there in the open

423
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:59,040
source space that can do what we want

424
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:00,800
we have a package that does some atomic

425
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,480
physics from oxford but nothing that

426
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:05,599
will actually create

427
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:08,560
an awg pulse so

428
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,680
this is also a big deficiency of open

429
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,800
source software

430
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,719
in this space too is that we have

431
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:16,240
nothing that can actually create quantum

432
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,240
gates for our trapped ions

433
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:22,160
lastly you need optics you need to route

434
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:25,360
the beams so they're actually pointing

435
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:25,360
at the trap in the ions

436
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:29,439
for here most of it is just mechanical

437
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:32,880
you just set up a bunch of mirrors

438
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:34,320
on a table um so there's no software or

439
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:36,320
hardware involved or anything that we

440
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:40,079
would need from open source space

441
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:42,399
um but uh some

442
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:43,199
some setups need motorized mounts is the

443
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:47,279
thing

444
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:47,279
um you need to change the directions

445
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:55,839
sorry my bike fell off

446
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:01,439
and so technically it's not necessary

447
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:05,120
but it's nice that we do have

448
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:06,959
software for this as well um

449
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,720
and the last thing you need is servos

450
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:10,079
and this is just to correct errors in

451
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,079
the laser

452
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:13,599
in terms of like direction in terms of

453
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:16,638
laser intensity

454
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:18,560
etc so

455
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:20,720
for servo space we have the nist servo

456
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:22,880
which is an extremely full featured

457
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,240
servo from nist those basically all you

458
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:27,279
want has all these different

459
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:31,199
control methods so you can correct

460
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:32,800
a lot of different error types has a ui

461
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:34,560
then this servo tells you everything you

462
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:36,319
need to know about servos it does

463
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:39,199
everything you would want from a servo

464
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:40,880
unfortunately the hardware is flawed so

465
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:44,079
for people from more of a hardware

466
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:44,420
and electronic background you would need

467
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:45,680
to

468
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:47,439
[Music]

469
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:49,599
you probably need to go in and rewrite

470
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:53,040
some of this hardware code

471
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:54,560
in order to get it at the level of

472
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:57,599
quality which you need to run

473
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:59,518
a quantum computer and the last thing is

474
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,639
from mlabs you have a much more simple

475
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:03,279
servo

476
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:06,000
that doesn't have some of the features

477
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:08,959
that the nest server does in terms of ui

478
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,359
um things that you need like measuring

479
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:14,559
transfer functions etc like very

480
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:17,760
very like engineering specific things

481
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:20,000
so this is some place actually the more

482
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:22,799
software investment would be

483
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,799
fruitful i think

484
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:28,240
so our status is that then this servo

485
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:30,400
needs some more hardware and

486
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,600
the sonar sampler needs some more

487
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,840
software investment

488
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:35,520
but we have everything we need to

489
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:37,600
actually run a laser setup on our

490
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:41,120
trapdown computer

491
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:43,439
last section is just control so we have

492
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:44,320
we can put ions in a trap we can shoot

493
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:47,039
lasers at them

494
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:48,480
the lasers can do what we want um we

495
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:49,840
don't have the physics for the lasers

496
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:52,160
but everything else yeah

497
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:54,639
so in order to put this all together we

498
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:58,240
just need control software

499
00:17:54,640 --> 00:18:00,320
so this is what a real quantum computing

500
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:02,320
operating system looks like you have a

501
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:04,960
bunch of

502
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:06,399
devices over on the right you're reading

503
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,360
the status of all these devices they

504
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:11,280
told you about

505
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:13,120
like uh dds etc your awg

506
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:14,639
you have tools for running quantum

507
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:16,479
programs so

508
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,400
you see a little bit of code on the left

509
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:21,520
it's actually code for

510
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:23,200
an experiment on the quantum computer

511
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,559
that code needs to have access to the

512
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,760
devices so that's where the operating

513
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:28,639
system comes in

514
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:30,400
it exposes the entire quantum computer

515
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,080
to that code and in the middle you can

516
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,640
kind of see the execution of an

517
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:36,240
experiment so this is real data from an

518
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:38,559
experiment

519
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,679
those are logs from the experiment etc

520
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:42,480
this is like kind of your

521
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:42,880
execution environment it goes through

522
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,840
and

523
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:47,440
using python or javascript stitches

524
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,799
together all the devices we are talking

525
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:52,160
about

526
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:52,160
in order to do what we need

527
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:57,039
a quantum experiment is needs to run

528
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:59,679
very quickly and you need to run

529
00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:01,520
a lot of them so when we're talking very

530
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:03,760
quickly we're talking on the scale of

531
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:05,600
nanoseconds so generally what you'll do

532
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,879
is you say what you want to do you say

533
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,000
how many times you want to do it and

534
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,240
then it runs on

535
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,840
electronics so it's not javascript or

536
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,640
python code running live during your

537
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,720
experiment

538
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:16,960
you have a little cpu controlling all

539
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,679
the electronics it has its own program

540
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,600
type

541
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:21,520
you send it off you let it do 100

542
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:25,039
experiments but it's all running in loop

543
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:26,960
in very quick electronics so for quantum

544
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:28,559
operating systems there are actually two

545
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,559
open source quantum operating systems

546
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:31,280
and they all integrate with the devices

547
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:34,480
we've been

548
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:35,760
talking about previously so from sandia

549
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,559
ion control which i've been talking

550
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,960
about

551
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:40,240
integrates of off-the-shelf components

552
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,559
in the actual

553
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:44,240
code from sandia they tell you exactly

554
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:44,799
which devices they integrate with so you

555
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:47,600
could just

556
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:49,120
buy them and you could run uh sandia's

557
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,320
iron control to control your quantum

558
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:53,520
computer

559
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:55,918
like tomorrow maybe

560
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,559
um and arctic is kind of the same thing

561
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:58,880
they run

562
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:59,600
on their on m labs as open source

563
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,640
hardware

564
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:04,559
and they're very tightly coupled so

565
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,760
these control systems require specific

566
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:07,039
hardware components

567
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:09,679
so if you're buying them off the shelf

568
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:12,879
or you're using mlabs

569
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:14,240
open source hardware but

570
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,080
you don't get a lot of variety in

571
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:18,159
hardware you can't mix and match

572
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:20,720
the operating system with the hardware

573
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:21,280
so the status of these code bases is

574
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,039
that they have

575
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:24,720
a ui they have documentation they have

576
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:25,760
supporting devices they're relatively

577
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,840
easy setup

578
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:30,000
but they're very tightly integrated so

579
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:32,720
we don't necessarily have the operating

580
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,240
system we need for our particular

581
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,000
open source quantum computer that has

582
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:39,600
its own trap has

583
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,600
parts from berkeley et cetera

584
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,440
i talked about kind of the needs of

585
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,799
running an actual quantum program where

586
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,840
we figure out everything ahead of time

587
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:49,039
and we run it on a specific

588
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:50,720
chip quantum programs need to be

589
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:52,879
controlled at very high speeds so we

590
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:55,039
have a custom cpu

591
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:56,960
those we can also find open source

592
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:59,200
examples of so the ones that

593
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,240
mlabs and sandia use to run their

594
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,559
experiments

595
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:03,760
on the quantum operating system are open

596
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:06,720
source

597
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:08,559
those are the links over there um it's

598
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:10,400
kind of

599
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:12,158
the quality of those offerings those

600
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,799
parity of their respective operating

601
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:15,039
systems

602
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:16,879
so in terms of documentation in terms of

603
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:18,158
discoverability it's a package deal with

604
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,240
the operating systems of which they're

605
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:22,799
associated with

606
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:24,400
um and finally it's the last light for

607
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:26,960
hardware and this is just for me to

608
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:28,080
complain about fpga and circuit tool

609
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:31,120
chains which are

610
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:33,678
quantum adjacent but ruin my life

611
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:35,199
um most of the open source hardware we

612
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:37,039
use as soon as you have vivado or

613
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,320
altiums if you wanted to use the code

614
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:39,840
for the open source hardware

615
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:41,520
to actually make these things you would

616
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:43,520
have to have some really expensive

617
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:46,799
licenses

618
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:49,600
thousand dollars so it's not really

619
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:51,520
that open source um in order to really

620
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:53,439
have a dream of a student creating their

621
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:54,158
own quantum computer end-to-end you need

622
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,559
an open source

623
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:57,679
fpga tool chain and probably a

624
00:21:56,559 --> 00:22:00,879
schematics viewer

625
00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:01,360
alternative that's open source um thing

626
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,360
is

627
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:05,120
it seems basically impossible from when

628
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,439
i googled this to make your own open

629
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,678
source

630
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:09,760
fpga tool chain it's in a subject of

631
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:12,559
active university research

632
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:15,440
so someone's phd thesis is doing this so

633
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:15,440
that looks pretty bleak

634
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,679
and finally i'm going to go through and

635
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,039
talk about the state of open source

636
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:23,280
quantum computing wrapping up

637
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:24,559
everything we've talked about what's

638
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:26,158
wrong where could

639
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:28,080
an open source contributor make a

640
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:30,000
difference where could you

641
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:31,520
improve the open source quorum computer

642
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,280
et cetera

643
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:34,879
um so first we went there and talked

644
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:37,760
about the oven which is responsible for

645
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:40,000
releasing atoms into the trap

646
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:42,799
and this is we have what we need in

647
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:46,159
terms of like a specific ion species

648
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:48,400
um for actual trap as we said it would

649
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:50,080
be nice to have pre-modeled chips so we

650
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,600
could just print out schematics for a

651
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:54,080
specific chip and be

652
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:55,360
ready to go all we need is two ions per

653
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:57,280
student

654
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:59,439
for camera we need open source camera

655
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:01,678
hardware cameras are very expensive

656
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:03,200
and i would say the quality of camera

657
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:05,280
drivers is very minimalist

658
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,880
so it gives you the bare necessities of

659
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,440
what you need to actually look at ions

660
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:11,440
but

661
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:12,640
nothing more than that for dds this is

662
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:15,440
fully open sourced

663
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:18,000
and looks very high quality with the awg

664
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:20,159
we have no open source awg

665
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,600
mostly we can do what we need with dds

666
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:24,880
so this isn't that bad

667
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:28,480
but would be nice to get this full

668
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:31,120
entangling gates um for pulses

669
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,679
i'd say probably the state of physics

670
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:34,399
software

671
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:35,280
open source for trapped ion is a little

672
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,200
bleak

673
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:39,039
there's not that much out there and

674
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,799
physics is probably the biggest limiting

675
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:41,919
capacity for people who actually want to

676
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:43,200
go out and make their own quantum

677
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:47,200
computer

678
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:49,600
for the operating system all of the new

679
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,480
uh physics software or quantum hardware

680
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,760
that we use

681
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:53,679
would need to integrate with the

682
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:55,279
operating system so the ones we talked

683
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:57,280
about we need to be extended or a new

684
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:58,400
one would need to be written

685
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:00,240
[Music]

686
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,600
and for experiment cpu the same thing

687
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:03,440
experiment cpus

688
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,959
needed are tightly very tightly

689
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:09,039
connected hardware they

690
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:10,320
send they communicate directly of dds's

691
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:12,879
things like that with electronic

692
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:14,320
components um and then for hardware tool

693
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:16,559
chains these are fully closed source

694
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:19,678
and very expensive which makes it hard

695
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:23,360
for our

696
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:25,600
student persona we've been talking about

697
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:28,719
so room for improvement i see we've

698
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:30,639
talked about what's missing

699
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:32,080
for running a quantum operating system

700
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:35,520
you're talking sometimes like

701
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:37,520
50 or 100 devices um and so you need a

702
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:38,559
really large computer of a lot of usb

703
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:41,120
hubs to run

704
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:42,879
your quantum computer i think if you

705
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:45,120
really want to emancipate the student

706
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:47,520
quantum computer maker you would have

707
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:50,000
a way to run an operating system off a

708
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:51,918
system head or like distribute

709
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,840
the management of devices so device

710
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:56,320
servers

711
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:58,320
we need integrated trap ship design

712
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,960
waveform modeling and dac hardware so

713
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,360
you need an

714
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:02,480
end-to-end thing that can create your

715
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:05,520
electric field

716
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:05,840
in physics and can run it on hardware we

717
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:08,080
need

718
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:10,399
integrated trap modeling pole solver and

719
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:14,240
awg you need kind of like

720
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:17,360
the ableton live of laser pulses

721
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:20,159
something that can go through produce

722
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:21,039
laser shapes and actually program an awg

723
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:22,799
with them

724
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:24,559
camera drivers are still very minimalist

725
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:26,240
we can look at ions but we want to do

726
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:28,720
things like automatically detect

727
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:29,679
when they leave when they enter things

728
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:31,679
like that so this

729
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:35,279
is for the computer vision researchers

730
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:37,840
and the audience your time to shine

731
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:39,360
we have open source servos whichever

732
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,320
lack features or have hardware

733
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:42,559
deficiencies

734
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:44,000
so we need to choose between one or the

735
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:47,440
other and

736
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:49,760
it's not that great um

737
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:50,480
that is my presentation about building

738
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:53,360
your own

739
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:54,159
open source quantum computer my twitter

740
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:56,719
handle

741
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:57,760
and the last link at the bottom iron

742
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:00,559
cube jobs

743
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:02,240
we're hiring for software engineers

744
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:03,440
electrical engineers people of all

745
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:06,480
shapes and sizes

746
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:07,120
physicists even so if you like what you

747
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:11,060
saw

748
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:21,419
drop us a line and uh thank you

749
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:21,419
[Applause]

750
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:26,480
get some space for questions so if

751
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:28,960
anybody has a question to ask

752
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,960
felix

753
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:39,840
[Music]

754
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,840
oh sorry

755
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:46,320
one you mentioned about fpgas that

756
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:48,960
they're really like not not very open

757
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:50,960
and like a lot of licensing and

758
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,720
apj has been around like since i know

759
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:54,000
90s and i come like from electrical

760
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:55,600
engineering background and for years

761
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,080
nothing really has been changed

762
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:59,918
and also last year there was some talks

763
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:02,080
of people trying to like

764
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:04,159
making open source don't you think

765
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:07,918
similar things will happen with

766
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:11,279
quantum computing and if not why

767
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:12,159
um sorry the question was comparing

768
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:15,840
comparing with

769
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:17,840
fpgas uh

770
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:19,760
open source fpga toolchain sorry a lot

771
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:22,559
of people are getting up again

772
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:24,320
yeah comparing it like the the field of

773
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:26,720
fpgas it didn't

774
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:27,840
really become open source largely like

775
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:30,000
some attempts

776
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:31,039
so why do you think quantum will be

777
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,960
different

778
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:34,480
um well we have almost everything we

779
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,840
need to actually create an open source

780
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:39,039
quantum computer it's like

781
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:40,559
very close to do it end to end

782
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:42,640
why do i think it would happen with a

783
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:45,440
quantum computer

784
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:47,120
i don't know that it would whether or

785
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:49,200
not something becomes fully open source

786
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:50,320
is kind of a sociological problem i

787
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:53,039
think there's

788
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:54,960
value in it and that it's like it's very

789
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:59,440
close to becoming fully real

790
00:27:54,960 --> 00:28:00,799
um so it's

791
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:02,399
yeah it's hard to say whether it's like

792
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:03,200
captivating enough to actually happen

793
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:06,080
organically

794
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,559
but it could plausibly happen it's kind

795
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:09,039
of my

796
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:09,039
takeaway

797
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:13,039
any other questions

798
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:29,199
no okay all right thanks for having me
