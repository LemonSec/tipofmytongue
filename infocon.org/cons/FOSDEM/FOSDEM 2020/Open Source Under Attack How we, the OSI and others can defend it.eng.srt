1
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,520
uh welcome everyone

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:09,599
this talk is called open source under

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:17,920
attack it's presented by uh

4
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:17,920
chris anicek michael chung and max sills

5
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,840
cool everyone okay you hear me i hear

6
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,840
myself

7
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:30,000
so um you know my name is chris sanzik

8
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:31,679
uh you know i've had the fun i don't

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,800
know i'm getting a little feedback but

10
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:36,800
hopefully that stops testing testing

11
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:43,520
good all right so um my name is chris

12
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,000
hansik i've had the fun opportunity of

13
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,920
working

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,120
in open source for probably the last 20

15
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,280
years as a

16
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,320
you know maintainer to starting an open

17
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,879
source company

18
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,800
uh before it was cool to now working at

19
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:57,039
a non-profit foundation and you know

20
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:59,919
over the years open source has grown

21
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:01,760
been extremely successful and you know

22
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,359
uh with my position here

23
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,280
you know and some colleagues we're going

24
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,840
to talk a little bit about how

25
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,600
you know the kind of world has changed

26
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,600
and how we could protect open source as

27
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,240
it is currently under attack by some

28
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,880
bad actors out there and i'm speaking

29
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,798
with

30
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,158
colleagues uh you know michael chang and

31
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:21,119
max ellis which

32
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:23,280
are two uh let's call them uh corporate

33
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:25,280
open source lawyers that work for the

34
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,400
advertising industrial complex i don't

35
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,320
hold that against them

36
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,600
i still think they do great things for

37
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,520
for open source but

38
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,720
we'll kind of get started and kind of

39
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:36,720
kick things off to

40
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,720
um max here

41
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:41,840
thanks chris

42
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:46,240
hi i'm max sells um so we wanted to

43
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,880
start this presentation

44
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,640
oh i'm going to stand right here okay we

45
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:53,199
wanted to start this presentation

46
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,119
more theoretical give kind of like a

47
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,920
high level overview of what the problems

48
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:58,560
are

49
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,399
um open source regulation and open

50
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,240
source attack can be very emotional

51
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:04,159
they're highly charged topics

52
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,759
but i think some of the problems going

53
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:07,360
on in open source are actually very

54
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,840
similar to problems going on

55
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:11,599
in tons of other domains so it can kind

56
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,959
of be instructive to see how these

57
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:15,839
problems just operate

58
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,879
and here's the fundamental structure

59
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,840
that we have

60
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:21,120
open source software is a shared public

61
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,000
good

62
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:26,000
like trees or water and this is really

63
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,400
how we want you to think about it

64
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,160
to situate our talk so it's something

65
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,920
that everyone kind of shares and

66
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,519
consumes

67
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,238
but it's also something that we have to

68
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:36,239
take care of

69
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,000
and so there's there's two kind of

70
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,000
concepts that we want to talk about

71
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,599
one is the public commons or this public

72
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,239
shared good of

73
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:47,518
software and then the other is ways to

74
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:49,519
regulate it

75
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:50,800
so if you look at the gpl i think a lot

76
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:52,160
of people have a lot of different

77
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,440
feelings about the gpl

78
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:58,480
but fundamentally what it did was it was

79
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:02,159
an early economic solution

80
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:04,959
to this commons problem there were

81
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:06,000
people who wanted to create a commons of

82
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:07,920
public software

83
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
and it was a system it was a technique

84
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,839
to make sure that people gave back

85
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,239
kind of like if you're going to cut down

86
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:17,120
a tree to build a house

87
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:17,680
make sure you plant another tree and

88
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,280
when

89
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:24,959
foss was in its early days no one really

90
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:26,239
um analyzes too deeply or identified any

91
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:28,480
problems with it

92
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:29,680
because the production and consumption

93
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,640
were kind of

94
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:35,360
in equilibrium and there wasn't so much

95
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:38,000
money riding on open source

96
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,799
so yeah commons is an unregulated shared

97
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,040
good

98
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:42,080
the the thing about commons and i'm sure

99
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:45,040
a lot of people have heard of the

100
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:47,920
concept of a tragedy of the commons

101
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:50,000
as the economic incentives to exploit

102
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:52,238
the commons grow

103
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,920
more people will exploit them that's

104
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:58,400
just basic

105
00:03:53,920 --> 00:04:00,480
um if you can make a dollar of fish

106
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,159
by fishing in shared waters okay that's

107
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,518
pretty interesting but if you can start

108
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:05,120
all of a sudden if you make a thousand

109
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:07,120
dollars of fish

110
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,799
and no one is stopping you from fishing

111
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,760
besides your own kind of like ethical

112
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:11,760
principles

113
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:14,239
corporations and other entities which

114
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:16,159
are sometimes legally required to try to

115
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:18,320
maximize shareholder value like

116
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,680
our entire global legal system is going

117
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,839
to be set up to incentivize this

118
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,520
behavior

119
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:26,080
the the thing i want you to think about

120
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:27,758
is like okay this is a this is a problem

121
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,840
we have this public commons that we

122
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:31,680
depend on a lot

123
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:34,080
and it's started to become really

124
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:37,199
profitable to overfish

125
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:39,440
these waters so how do we regulate

126
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,440
um

127
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,479
so there's two types of things we're

128
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,960
going to focus on and later we're going

129
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:48,240
to talk

130
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:51,280
about some proposals we have but

131
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,080
up until now this concept of open source

132
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,880
branding

133
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:56,000
has been an effective self uh regulating

134
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,320
mechanism to to

135
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,560
prevent overfishing if you want of the

136
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:03,120
of the commons

137
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,960
because peop it's been used as an

138
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,919
identifier people understand what that

139
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,799
means

140
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:09,758
but it's become way too lucrative to lie

141
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,880
and so

142
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:14,000
the the best analogy we have here is

143
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,000
green washing

144
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,840
right we should i think we should think

145
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,039
about this in an ecological

146
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:22,799
sense the same way that

147
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:24,400
um we need to protect the climate we

148
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,680
need to protect the environment because

149
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,359
it's a shared resource that we all

150
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,280
depend on

151
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,360
greenwashing is when businesses for

152
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:33,679
their own profit

153
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,639
divert resources that would otherwise

154
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,000
have gone to

155
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:38,000
improving the climate improving the

156
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,880
environment by branding themselves

157
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,240
as eco-friendly and you can't do that

158
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,960
it's illegal

159
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,320
i think open washing and also offering a

160
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,560
piece of software under one license but

161
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,759
later changing it's the same exact thing

162
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:53,520
because what you're doing is you're

163
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:56,639
inducing market participants

164
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:59,198
to invest time money energy

165
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:00,880
into what they think is a public commons

166
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:03,360
but really you're

167
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,319
pulling the rug from under them so great

168
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,360
a great

169
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:08,319
example is the recent vw issue so the

170
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,960
ftc in the

171
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:11,759
in the united states is pursuing a 15

172
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:15,039
billion dollar

173
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:17,520
action against vw um

174
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:18,240
that's that's that's serious money but i

175
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,318
want to think all

176
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,000
about like our own personal investments

177
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:23,360
in um

178
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,199
contributing to open source and kind of

179
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,120
what that means so with that i'm going

180
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:28,960
to pass it off to uh to michael but we

181
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,600
really hope you situate this talk

182
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,599
in this framework

183
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:37,840
thanks max hey folks my name is michael

184
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:41,360
chang

185
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:43,119
and in this section i will talk

186
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:45,120
uh we're going to define very

187
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,960
specifically what we mean when we say

188
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:50,000
that open source is under attack

189
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:53,359
or the commons is being eroded

190
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,680
so whether in the form of open core

191
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,759
as a business model or the new and

192
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,800
misleading licenses that come out of

193
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:01,360
open core

194
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,560
the essential issue is always the same

195
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,599
which is

196
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:08,560
proprietary licenses proprietary

197
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:08,960
software masquerading or pretending to

198
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,080
be

199
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:16,479
open source right and that creates

200
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:20,318
confusion and it is this confusion

201
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:23,840
about what is safe to use

202
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:25,840
open source right versus what is not

203
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:28,880
safe to use in my project

204
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:31,599
or my product

205
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:32,479
proprietary software or source available

206
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:35,759
software

207
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:38,960
it is this confusion that erodes trust

208
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:40,319
psychologically what happens is when i

209
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,960
use something

210
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:44,000
that i think is safe and then later

211
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:47,120
turns out not to be

212
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,400
safe i lose faith in my ability to

213
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:51,759
identify

214
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:54,960
safe to differentiate safe from unsafe

215
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:58,479
and i'm much less likely to use

216
00:07:54,960 --> 00:08:03,039
the safe thing uh going forward

217
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:06,960
and this confusion directly gets at

218
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:10,080
or directly erodes the

219
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:11,840
rationale and why we do open source

220
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:14,400
and the things that make open source

221
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:16,719
compelling we do open source because

222
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:18,400
it's efficient it's often the most

223
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,919
practical most effective way to do

224
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,799
development

225
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:24,159
and to the extent that i'm spending time

226
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,000
trying to figure out

227
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:28,400
whether the license whether the

228
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,879
component is safe to use or not safe to

229
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,120
use

230
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:32,560
that's less time i'm spending doing the

231
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,880
actual development

232
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:36,159
and up to a certain point it then

233
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:39,200
becomes

234
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:40,159
uh the open source becomes that that

235
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,200
much less

236
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:44,800
efficient for me to use to a point where

237
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,360
it becomes indistinguishable from

238
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:49,279
proprietary software

239
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,040
we do open source because it engenders a

240
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:53,519
sense of community

241
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,079
that sense of community is built on a

242
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:56,480
foundation

243
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,760
of shared values shared goals and most

244
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,320
importantly shared rules of

245
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,319
engagement

246
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:05,120
nothing destroys trust in the community

247
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,040
faster than introducing

248
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,240
participants that look like and look and

249
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,920
talk and feel like members of the

250
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,920
community but in actuality

251
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,839
bringing an entirely contradictory set

252
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:15,439
of rules of engagement

253
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:17,519
to how they deal with the community and

254
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:20,720
how they deal with one another

255
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:25,200
an example of this is of course when

256
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:26,880
a community member makes a pull request

257
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,040
sends a pull request to an open core

258
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:32,240
repository

259
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:34,480
that pull request is refused or rejected

260
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:36,240
for one reason or another and then

261
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,720
sometime later

262
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,279
the same feature and sometimes the same

263
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,399
code

264
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:44,240
appears in the closed stack of

265
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:45,760
the open core company which they then

266
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:48,480
sell for money

267
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:49,519
now it's entirely possible that they

268
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,800
were going to come up with that feature

269
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:51,279
anyway it was entirely possible that

270
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,719
that was

271
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:56,560
probably on their road map but in some

272
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,560
cases the timing is very suspect

273
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,760
and all of this sort of starts with open

274
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:03,120
core and

275
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:06,640
open core is the

276
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:10,000
decision to build a business on top of

277
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:11,199
a formula right this formula involves

278
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,480
the combination

279
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:17,600
of uh part of your

280
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:19,920
product part of your technology stack

281
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,040
will be made open it will be made

282
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,360
available free

283
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:25,760
on open source terms and then another

284
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,600
part of your technology stack will be

285
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,839
closed or proprietary which you then

286
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:32,959
sell for money

287
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:36,399
critical to this business analysis

288
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:38,239
is the judgment that

289
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:39,440
certain percentage or a certain

290
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:42,560
proportion of open

291
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:45,920
versus a certain proportion of co close

292
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:46,479
will generate a will generate revenue

293
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,240
for you

294
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,160
right it's it's an assumption that it

295
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,600
will generally revenue it will stand the

296
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:55,279
test of time

297
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:57,040
um and uh it will create a viable

298
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:58,880
business for you going into the future

299
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,640
right that's the assumption

300
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,160
that's the business model those are the

301
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,880
assumptions made about the business

302
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:06,240
model

303
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:09,120
by these open core companies of course

304
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:10,640
that assumption is part of a larger set

305
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,000
of assumptions about

306
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:14,319
what they can protect what they can't

307
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,040
protect but it manifests itself

308
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:18,640
in the in the case of a proportion of

309
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:21,279
open versus closed

310
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:22,240
and so of course inevitably uh things

311
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:24,480
change

312
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:26,320
markets move away from companies markets

313
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,959
move away from certain products

314
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,399
markets evolve or sometimes the founders

315
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:32,560
of these companies just get

316
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:34,959
the business model wrong they made the

317
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:37,199
wrong decision as to what proportion

318
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:39,279
is open and what proportions closed and

319
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,640
that inevitably what do they do in that

320
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:44,160
situation well what they do

321
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:44,160
is they inevitably

322
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:50,320
decide to make the open part

323
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:51,279
of their stack open part of their

324
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,880
product

325
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:55,360
they decide to make that closed and they

326
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:58,800
decide to pick a proprietary license

327
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:01,440
right this activity this

328
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:02,639
while potentially technically allowed

329
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,240
under the terms of the contributor

330
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:07,839
license agreement

331
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:11,200
also erodes trust because it upsets

332
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:12,320
expectations of users and contributors

333
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,279
who invested

334
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,680
on the basis of part of the stack being

335
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:17,600
open

336
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:20,560
and now the entire stack is now closed

337
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,560
or proprietary

338
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:26,160
what is worse about this is that the

339
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:27,519
way that open core companies have

340
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:30,639
sometimes

341
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:34,240
uh sort of presented the re-licensing

342
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:35,040
is one of uh blaming everyone but

343
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,600
themselves

344
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:39,120
right they they uh they talk about they

345
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,320
blame public cloud providers they blame

346
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,000
the open source license

347
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:44,160
they blame there's lots of people to

348
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,480
blame but in actuality

349
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:48,319
in many cases the market has moved away

350
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,680
from them in many cases maybe they just

351
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:53,200
made the wrong decision about the

352
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:56,800
proportion of open versus closed

353
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:59,120
uh to add insult to injury the the

354
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,079
the names of the licenses that they've

355
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:03,120
used

356
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:06,399
when re-licensing names like public

357
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:08,240
commons community in the context

358
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:10,160
of open source development where

359
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:12,839
developers spend

360
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:15,120
seconds just mere seconds looking at the

361
00:13:12,839 --> 00:13:17,600
license.txt file

362
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,160
there's no other reason to use these

363
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,040
terms

364
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:22,319
except to create confusion that a

365
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:25,680
license

366
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:27,680
is safe to use and then when

367
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:29,040
when folks find out later that it's not

368
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:31,680
safe to use

369
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:32,319
uh further erodes trust further erodes

370
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:35,680
goodwill

371
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:38,240
in the community this is not a new

372
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:40,560
phenomenon this started of course with

373
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:43,600
the shared source initiative

374
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:45,439
back in 2001 and perhaps earlier which a

375
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:47,199
former osi president called

376
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,519
an insurgent term that distracts and

377
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:50,800
dilutes the open source message by using

378
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:54,720
similar sounding terms

379
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:57,359
and offering similar sounding promises

380
00:13:54,720 --> 00:14:00,000
at the end of the day the more time you

381
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:03,199
spend trying to understand the license

382
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,720
the more time uh the closer we all come

383
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:07,839
to a proprietary world

384
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:11,600
right uh where uh lawyers are everywhere

385
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:12,560
it's this uh dystopian post-apocalyptic

386
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,040
future where

387
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:16,479
trust is lost low efficient there's low

388
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:19,920
efficiency in open source

389
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:23,920
at which point uh for many users

390
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:25,920
it you might as well just go proprietary

391
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,959
free software will live on it always

392
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:30,160
will but

393
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:33,439
the pool of potential

394
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:34,079
converts will shrink because uh after

395
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:37,440
having been

396
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:40,479
soured on the promise on on on

397
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,199
the problems with open open core and on

398
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:44,079
that

399
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:45,599
very cheerful note uh i will now hand it

400
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:47,279
to my colleague

401
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,600
chris who will talk about why this is

402
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:49,600
happening

403
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,760
you hear me testing testing all right

404
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:57,519
back so uh you know

405
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:59,199
michael did a good job explaining about

406
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:01,120
some of the attacks going on

407
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:03,040
uh i think there's a lot more than just

408
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,240
purely uh the open court crowd that is

409
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,399
trying to steer

410
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:08,000
open source licensing into interesting

411
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:08,320
directions but part of the reasons these

412
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,440
are

413
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,279
attacks are happening is because

414
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,560
fundamentally the world has changed

415
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:13,760
especially in the last decade when it

416
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:16,479
comes to open source

417
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:17,680
i started my career you know in an

418
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:21,199
environment where

419
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:23,040
the great satan of you know you know

420
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:24,399
the time was you know microsoft right

421
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,160
open source was evil

422
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:27,680
you know i spent probably 10 years of my

423
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,719
career fighting against their you

424
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,399
know.net

425
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:33,279
ecosystem and all that all the

426
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:35,519
proprietary uh hell that is going on but

427
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:37,360
now you know especially if you talk to

428
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:39,279
someone that maybe didn't grow in that

429
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:41,680
grow up in that time or experience that

430
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:44,160
time it's like microsoft is great you

431
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:45,279
know vs code is the jam it makes my life

432
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,439
super easy right

433
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:48,720
so you know the attitudes and the

434
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,720
companies involved

435
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,759
have completely shifted how they're

436
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,240
doing business and how they're

437
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:54,560
interacting with communities so times uh

438
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:58,560
have

439
00:15:54,560 --> 00:16:00,399
changed um in terms of the percentage of

440
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:02,560
companies that are actually running

441
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:04,480
open source software themselves has

442
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,199
changed an incredible amount in in the

443
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,639
last uh

444
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:10,719
in the last decade you know in just 2010

445
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:12,800
you know some data from some of the you

446
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,639
know uh the black ducks the the

447
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,439
compliance industrial complex companies

448
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:18,639
of the world

449
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:20,480
basically pit that you know hey about 39

450
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:22,320
you know these companies were using open

451
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:24,160
source uh at that time

452
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:27,519
now you know if you whether you go

453
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:29,680
through data from like github blackduck

454
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:31,440
it's hard to find no organization on the

455
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:33,120
planet that does not have some form of

456
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:35,440
open source dependency

457
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,240
out there from a company perspective

458
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,120
we're also

459
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,920
changing how we build products a long

460
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,519
time ago

461
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:43,439
the majority of products maybe not a

462
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:47,040
long time a majority of products were

463
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:49,360
mostly built on a proprietary core

464
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,079
now we've moved to a model where the

465
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,480
majority

466
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:53,359
of what is happening in product

467
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,839
development is

468
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:57,199
basically building a thin veneer of

469
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:59,839
proprietary code

470
00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:01,279
based on mostly open source components

471
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:03,920
that you stitch together

472
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:05,679
and improve on and so on so you know the

473
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,399
change here is even in a short amount of

474
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:08,720
time

475
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,079
open source has essentially infiltrated

476
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,559
you know product development

477
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:13,678
and now comprises the majority of what

478
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:17,199
is done and built

479
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:20,240
in in a proprietary product um

480
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:21,839
we have also moved to uh you know

481
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:24,319
traditionally now a more permissive

482
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:26,159
comments the the rise of more companies

483
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:28,399
depending on using open source

484
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,679
have favored a more permissive approach

485
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,840
and you've seen this

486
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:33,520
uh change market in the last you know

487
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:35,120
five to ten years that

488
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:37,280
more and more you know new software that

489
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:39,039
has development more new ecosystems like

490
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,240
the javascript ecosystem the cloudiness

491
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:41,679
and they're all fading more permissive

492
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,120
approaches and that has led

493
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:45,280
to more increased sharing and

494
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,639
development uh across corporation which

495
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,760
is another market change and how the

496
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,559
world has changed

497
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:52,080
um there's also the crazy problem that

498
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:53,120
with all this spread and uses open

499
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,360
source from

500
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:56,479
you know cars fridges you know things

501
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,000
that we all depend on

502
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,760
there's a huge issue now potentially

503
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
even securing the commons and even the

504
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,000
last

505
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,360
few years the number of issues that are

506
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,080
found in

507
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:07,360
products and you know companies uh you

508
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:09,918
know getting fined is

509
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:11,600
is is increasing so this is another

510
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:13,600
market change of how much open source

511
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:16,799
has become pervasive and critical

512
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:17,918
uh for companies and and and products uh

513
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:21,039
out there

514
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:23,280
the other big change that is going on is

515
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:25,360
when i started my career i remembered

516
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:27,120
there was a very kind of niche

517
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:28,799
set of companies out there that were

518
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,918
doing open source you had like your

519
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:32,559
cygnus folks

520
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:34,080
red hat there were very few companies

521
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:36,000
that were focused on

522
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,520
on purely open source development what

523
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,919
has happened over time

524
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:40,559
open open source has entered new markets

525
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:42,799
so there

526
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:43,678
are products out there from crm

527
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:47,600
solutions

528
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:49,679
to uh office suites to databases

529
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:51,360
there's more and more uh you know open

530
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:53,360
source being built to

531
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:54,959
you know basically build businesses and

532
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:57,360
part of these businesses

533
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,720
are essentially you know you know just

534
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,959
like in any other kind of like

535
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,760
capitalist uh market is they are being

536
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,600
funded

537
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:05,039
by investors you know venture

538
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,080
capitalists and so on and this is

539
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:08,240
essentially

540
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:10,480
big money now you know we've had tons of

541
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:12,640
companies either get bought

542
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,919
you know or ipo in the last few years in

543
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:16,640
the open source space

544
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:18,320
uh red hat arguably the largest uh you

545
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:20,000
know software acquisition

546
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:21,678
you know in in the world just not even

547
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,520
counting it was the largest software

548
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:26,960
uh acquisition uh recently and so

549
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,639
if you kind of look at the data there's

550
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,919
this kind of fun

551
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:33,280
little spreadsheet out there called

552
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:35,679
oss.cash which basically goes

553
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,639
and tries to give a list of all the

554
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:38,720
companies

555
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,919
that are essentially let's call them

556
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,520
commercial open source

557
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:43,679
companies and you know what their

558
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:45,280
respective valuations are how much money

559
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:48,000
they're potentially making and so on

560
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,320
and this has become a essentially what

561
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,320
was

562
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:52,240
you know almost you know less than a

563
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,879
billion dollars a decade ago to 140

564
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:56,400
billion

565
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:58,160
uh today and only continuing uh to grow

566
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,840
and so what happens is when you have

567
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:02,880
these companies that are

568
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:04,480
essentially raising money and investing

569
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:07,280
uh you know money from venture

570
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:09,039
capitalists they expect returns

571
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:11,039
you know just like any other investment

572
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:14,720
people put money in and they expect

573
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:16,640
you know typical vc sized returns

574
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:18,080
what's actually happening now is there's

575
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,679
a lot of concerns

576
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:21,600
from you know these folks that are

577
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:23,919
investing in these companies that

578
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:25,840
my return may actually not get what i

579
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:27,360
expect maybe there'll be some type of

580
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:29,280
some type of failure associated with

581
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:31,520
this because you know maybe

582
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:32,879
you know people could copy you know my

583
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:34,480
code without contributing back or the

584
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,799
clouds are strip mining

585
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:38,080
my stuff and not contributing back um

586
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:39,200
what's actually interesting is if you

587
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:41,280
kind of think about this

588
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:43,280
is it's you know for me it's really

589
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:46,399
difficult to maybe name

590
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:48,639
one company that has you know failed in

591
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:50,400
in this in kind of you know from a

592
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,600
cloud you know overtaking the business

593
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,960
or something the only recent company

594
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:55,039
going to really think of is

595
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:56,880
is docker has kind of floundered and i

596
00:20:55,039 --> 00:21:00,320
think that's less for

597
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:01,919
open source reasons but more from

598
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:04,080
you know business you know business

599
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:06,480
decisions of failing actually deliver

600
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:07,840
a good solid um you know business but

601
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,400
you know if you see us look at this we

602
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,720
threw

603
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:12,480
250 million in this and this company

604
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:15,440
basically was sold for scraps

605
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:16,799
not good for me um another interesting

606
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,720
behavior that's been happening is

607
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:20,000
certain venture capitalists out there

608
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:23,120
you know have been

609
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:25,440
directly attacking uh organizations out

610
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:26,639
there uh like the osi and have basically

611
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,799
said that look

612
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,000
you know this whole open core source

613
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:31,918
available thing is happening

614
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,200
because there's been a lack of

615
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:36,080
leadership from

616
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,640
industry associations such as the osi

617
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,240
and so

618
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,000
you know they're accusing the osi of

619
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:43,200
making commercial open source

620
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,000
less viable that to me is a little bit

621
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,840
insane because

622
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,360
you know they're essentially coming from

623
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:49,360
a perspective where they're

624
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:50,399
punching down to a much uh smaller

625
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:52,799
organization

626
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:55,200
uh and if you look at you know the last

627
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:58,080
you know decade or less 20 plus years

628
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:59,120
um you know that osi has been around

629
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:01,600
open source has been

630
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:03,039
pretty successful for you know their

631
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,240
their leadership in this thing but this

632
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:06,480
is an attack that is

633
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:07,760
is going on and you know obviously there

634
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,600
are things that could be

635
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:11,280
uh improved and you know we'll talk a

636
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:13,360
little bit uh about this

637
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:15,440
in uh you know the next couple of slides

638
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:17,120
but this is something that is directly

639
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:19,120
you know happening of of them going

640
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,360
after open source organizations such as

641
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:22,479
the

642
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:23,760
the osi one crazy thing that

643
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:27,039
has also been happening with kind of

644
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:29,679
this rise of source available licenses

645
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:30,158
it's caused some very interesting weird

646
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:33,039
uh

647
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:35,280
dynamics kind of uh in in kind of the

648
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:38,240
cloud space and commercial space so

649
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:40,320
one of my recent favorites is um you

650
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:42,880
know elastic

651
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:43,600
and amazon have been in this little spat

652
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:46,080
and uh

653
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:47,120
you know elastic basically you know did

654
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,240
the typical open

655
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:50,639
core thing we're going to play around

656
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:52,240
with licenses amazon

657
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:53,840
obviously got a little bit upset they

658
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,559
don't want to be beholden to this

659
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,320
particular

660
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:59,039
uh you know vendor and they viewed them

661
00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:00,799
as basically keeping features away from

662
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:01,600
from their customers and forcing people

663
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:04,400
to kind of

664
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:05,918
only you know go through them for for

665
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,480
said feature so what did they decide to

666
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:08,240
do

667
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,679
just like in open source you could

668
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,559
quote-unquote potentially fork i know

669
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:12,640
amazon doesn't

670
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:13,918
want to say that they fork the code base

671
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,960
that's not their intention but they're

672
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:16,159
essentially doing is like

673
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,240
look we got a lot of customers that

674
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:19,440
depend on elastic and our goal is to

675
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,360
make a distribution

676
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,640
that is fully open there's no open

677
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,399
course shenanigans

678
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:26,000
and we're just gonna you know develop

679
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,960
enhancements in there with everyone else

680
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,799
everyone's invited

681
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:30,880
that's been one weird side effect where

682
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:31,918
you now have you know fairly well funded

683
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:35,120
cloud providers

684
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:37,600
taking these open core related companies

685
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:39,120
to potentially the cleaners by offering

686
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:41,600
fully open versions

687
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:42,719
of things another interesting thing is

688
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,158
even

689
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,840
within the open core companies

690
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:49,200
themselves there has been

691
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:51,600
a ton of competition amongst them where

692
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,480
i i you know a little bit kind of laugh

693
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,320
at this where

694
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,600
you know uh let's say a couple database

695
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,799
companies or other open core companies

696
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,000
they're basically now comparing

697
00:23:56,799 --> 00:24:00,879
themselves that like

698
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,600
i am more open than my other you know

699
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:03,120
open core

700
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,879
uh fellow companies so like you know

701
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:06,239
yugabyte recently

702
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:08,000
you know not so long ago now it's like

703
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:09,840
we're going fully 100

704
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,840
open source for basically our enterprise

705
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:13,520
features our core and yes we're going to

706
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,879
have our proprietary management stuff

707
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:16,158
but that's cool you know they're open

708
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,880
with that they're not going to go down

709
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:19,760
this

710
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:21,440
kind of you know open core washing uh

711
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:23,679
route and that's kind of an interesting

712
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:25,679
trend that i'm seeing more and more

713
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:28,159
happen another example is

714
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:29,679
uh our friends at chef uh recently

715
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:31,440
decided to go you know what

716
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:33,440
uh we're just gonna go 100 we're going

717
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:35,919
to go red hat style 100

718
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:37,679
you know everything open uh we'll charge

719
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:39,440
people for an enterprise

720
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:41,120
distribution and so on but you know

721
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:43,440
we're not going to do open core who

722
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:45,360
needs it we're going to go fully

723
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:47,200
fully open if red hat can do it why not

724
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,559
us um

725
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,080
other interesting trend that's been

726
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:51,840
happening as someone who kind of spends

727
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:53,279
a little bit too much time in in you

728
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:55,120
know dealing with cloud providers and

729
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:56,720
and that kind of side of the market is

730
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:59,199
there's kind of been this this meme

731
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:00,080
going around that cloud providers are

732
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,919
strip mining

733
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:03,120
open source they're not giving anything

734
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:05,360
back and

735
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:07,678
what i think the the source available

736
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:09,199
and kind of open core

737
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:10,799
movement has done is actually kind of

738
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,640
forced the cloud cloud providers to

739
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:15,039
reevaluate things a little bit where

740
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:16,799
um they have started to now offer you

741
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:18,720
know revenue sharing agreements

742
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:20,480
they're contributing more and more back

743
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,440
to open source microsoft and google are

744
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,640
some of the largest open source

745
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:26,080
contributors out there

746
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:27,600
um you know even even our our friends

747
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:29,520
uh you know other organizations are

748
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:32,639
starting to to get their act together

749
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:34,799
but this is a marked change in the last

750
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,919
year or two um you know that that that's

751
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:38,639
happening

752
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:41,520
so these are just some you know

753
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:43,600
suggestions and ideas of basically

754
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:45,520
you know the world has change in open

755
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:48,559
source it is no longer a

756
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:50,799
individual niche business thing it is

757
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:52,720
basically powering all our lives and

758
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:54,400
businesses all over the world and we're

759
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:56,720
going to talk a little bit about

760
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:58,240
some solutions and ideas based on our

761
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,880
kind of experience that we kind of want

762
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,799
to offer

763
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:02,960
um to the audience so i'm going to go

764
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:05,279
hand it back to

765
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:07,039
max to discuss some potential ideas how

766
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:07,600
we could protect the commons and open

767
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:11,039
source

768
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:12,480
hi hello hi

769
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:14,400
trying to get the energy up nine am

770
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:17,279
talking honestly

771
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:19,679
um so we're going to talk about

772
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:21,279
solutions right now but

773
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:23,440
let's just do a quick summary quick

774
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:25,440
overview

775
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:27,760
it's just capitalism part of it is

776
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:29,840
capitalism people are going to try

777
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:31,840
different business models right and

778
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:34,158
they're going to try to advertise

779
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:35,520
smaller and smaller distinctions between

780
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:38,320
their product offerings

781
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:39,520
and their licenses to see what consumers

782
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:41,760
are interested in

783
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:42,960
and the really good business models will

784
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:45,120
be successful

785
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:47,919
and the bad business models will die so

786
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:50,799
in a sense why should you care

787
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:51,919
you should care when so yeah so people

788
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:53,039
are going to try to make money off

789
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:53,760
software development and they're going

790
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:55,919
to call it

791
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:57,760
whatever they can to make money but what

792
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:58,799
we should we should care when it starts

793
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,480
to hurt

794
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:01,918
everyone that's the thing that should

795
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:04,799
cause an alarm is

796
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:05,679
not just one company experimenting with

797
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:08,559
open core

798
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:09,440
this but close that what should concern

799
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:13,039
you is when

800
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:14,720
the aggregate behavior of all the people

801
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:18,080
start to make it really difficult to

802
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:20,399
understand what licenses mean anymore

803
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:21,439
and i think the another concerning thing

804
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:23,439
is

805
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:24,720
if we go back to the origins when i like

806
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:26,880
when we talk we were talking about the

807
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:28,799
gpl

808
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:31,360
the commons consumption used to be small

809
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:33,039
enough that little

810
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:34,959
organizations filled with people who

811
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:37,440
loved free and open source

812
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:38,799
were enough but there's just so much

813
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:40,960
money and so much

814
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:43,039
aggregate bad behavior that we have a

815
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:44,880
true tragedy that comments

816
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:47,360
and so there's a couple solutions that i

817
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:49,679
think we should start thinking about

818
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:50,719
i yeah the first we should really talk

819
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:53,120
about is

820
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:54,240
government regulation because we don't

821
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:56,959
just have regular

822
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:58,960
market dynamics anymore what we have is

823
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:00,720
a potential market failure

824
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:02,799
we're just letting people buy and sell

825
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:04,399
things to each other has not been

826
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:05,679
effective because we're diluting the

827
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:07,360
idea of open source

828
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:08,640
making it more difficult for people to

829
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:10,080
understand what software they can use

830
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:12,480
when software they can't

831
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:14,399
um i've been really impressed because

832
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:17,840
we've been we've been talking to some

833
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:18,719
european regulators they're very open to

834
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:22,320
technology they

835
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:24,399
understand how technology is developing

836
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:26,158
the open source community needs to enter

837
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:28,639
into a dialogue

838
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:29,520
with regulators because what we don't

839
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:32,720
want to happen

840
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:34,240
is the market failure gets worse it gets

841
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,880
worse it gets worse and then all of a

842
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:37,200
sudden

843
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:38,480
regulations happen that just complicate

844
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,960
the situation even more

845
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:44,640
we need an open and productive dialogue

846
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:46,720
so that some of these things are defined

847
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:48,000
the the two traditional ways of

848
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:50,640
protecting the commons

849
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,200
so one you have trademark protection

850
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,520
where

851
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:55,279
there's a law designed to protect

852
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:57,520
against consumer confusion

853
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:59,840
you have a source identifier people know

854
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:01,840
that this means this and that means that

855
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:03,439
the second thing that government

856
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:06,480
regulation can do though

857
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:10,159
is pass laws

858
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:13,919
and investigate deceptive advertising

859
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:16,000
pass laws and investigate open washing

860
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:17,679
because it's one thing for okay it's

861
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,200
just capitalism

862
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:20,720
people are going to try their thing it

863
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,559
works it doesn't work but it's another

864
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:25,360
when their behavior

865
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:27,440
puts in jeopardy the thing that we all

866
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:29,600
love

867
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:31,200
yeah so unfair competition and deceptive

868
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:33,360
trade practices

869
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:34,799
another thing um that i think we should

870
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:39,120
consider we're going to talk about

871
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:39,120
a little bit more shortly is

872
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:44,080
the a lot of people have been thinking

873
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:46,399
about the open core versus open source

874
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:49,279
or any innovations and licenses

875
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:49,678
as like very scary the thing we don't

876
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:52,960
want

877
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:52,960
is license proliferation

878
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:58,240
right but what if there was what if

879
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:00,000
there was a different perspective if you

880
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:02,080
go back to how we're trying to

881
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,520
frame the theoretical model behind this

882
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:04,399
if we're just trying to protect the

883
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:06,320
commons

884
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:09,840
so that we can all contribute to

885
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:09,840
something that we can share

886
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,760
maybe it's less about saying that a

887
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:15,520
certain business model is bad open core

888
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:18,240
is bad a new license is bad

889
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:18,720
and instead it's about creating more

890
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:22,960
clear

891
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:24,880
guard rails for the consuming public so

892
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:26,799
if we had certification marks if we had

893
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:29,279
more industry associations

894
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:29,840
open core should have its own industry

895
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:32,000
group

896
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:33,439
it should have it should file its own

897
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,000
certification mark

898
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:37,840
and one of the recommendations we're

899
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:41,919
making too is that the osi

900
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:44,158
um consider not just branding

901
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:45,120
and labeling what are acceptable osd

902
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:48,240
licenses

903
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:51,279
but also kind of branch out because the

904
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:53,520
the the biggest value that uh the osi

905
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:55,279
provides right now and under and other

906
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:57,200
volunteer-led industry groups

907
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:59,279
is by helping the market figure out what

908
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:01,919
is what that is really the truest

909
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:03,919
value that they're providing so that's

910
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:05,039
kind of the public regulatory solutions

911
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:06,559
now i'm going to

912
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:08,480
pass to michael for more specific

913
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:11,039
recommendations

914
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:11,039
thanks max

915
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:16,880
so for 20 years the osi has been at the

916
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:19,760
forefront of defending open source

917
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:22,480
through its curation of the osi approved

918
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:22,480
license list

919
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:29,039
one need not look very far or

920
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:31,918
one only need to look at the you know

921
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:34,240
day-to-day week-to-week activities of

922
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:38,480
the osi talk list to see

923
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:40,399
uh the product of their work uh

924
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:42,399
for every license that we hear about

925
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:43,279
that's proprietary license source

926
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:45,600
available

927
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:46,720
etc etc every weird license that we hear

928
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:50,559
about

929
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:52,159
there are dozens perhaps even more

930
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:53,918
strange licenses licenses that are

931
00:31:52,159 --> 00:32:00,559
harmful to community that the osi

932
00:31:53,919 --> 00:32:03,279
spares us from dealing with

933
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:05,279
and for that uh i think we all owe the

934
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:06,720
osi a huge debt of gratitude and the

935
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:07,840
value that they've contributed to the

936
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:11,120
open source community

937
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:11,120
is immeasurable

938
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:15,519
and with that uh one of the reasons one

939
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:17,200
of the things

940
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:19,279
that we think about in thinking about

941
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:20,320
how to attack or how to solve this

942
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:23,440
problem

943
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:26,720
is uh we like to think of the osi

944
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:30,159
as the master branch right from which

945
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:33,200
there is not a need to fork

946
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:34,960
and i think we want to be very clear

947
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:37,039
about what we say when we say

948
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:38,880
we mean we think the osi is the master

949
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:40,240
branch because

950
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:42,000
max has talked about a couple of

951
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:44,320
solutions chris will talk about a couple

952
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,960
more solutions but you know we don't

953
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:48,639
want you to get the idea that we want

954
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:50,799
a bunch of other forks or a bunch of

955
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:52,720
other people or organizations

956
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:54,879
taking up the mission of defending open

957
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:57,679
source what we would prefer

958
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:58,240
is for the osi to be at the heart of all

959
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:01,760
of this

960
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:04,960
right to either take action themselves

961
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:06,559
or direct or coordinate actions among

962
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:08,320
multiple groups

963
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:10,960
the reason for this is obvious right

964
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:13,039
it's not helpful to fork anything

965
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:14,080
and more importantly if you have

966
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:16,559
multiple

967
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:17,279
different organizations it your

968
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:19,760
interests

969
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:20,720
uh interested parties taking up the same

970
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:23,679
cause it

971
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:25,039
it creates tension and tension that

972
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:29,360
could otherwise be put

973
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:31,440
towards uh advancing our mission

974
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:32,399
taking that master branch analogy one

975
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:35,600
step further

976
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:36,000
uh one could make the argument that open

977
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:39,439
core

978
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:42,159
is the first fork uh of

979
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:44,480
the vision of open source right shared

980
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:47,760
by the community shared by the osi

981
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:50,240
right and and potentially more may come

982
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:52,000
open source as max and chris has

983
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:54,480
mentioned is principally used to be an

984
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,120
individually driven developer driven

985
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:59,120
activity

986
00:33:55,120 --> 00:34:02,239
it is the type of stakeholders

987
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:06,320
uh since you know that have come up

988
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:08,480
or are now consume use and contribute

989
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:10,719
open source are now much more diverse

990
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:13,199
right there are other organizations

991
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:14,078
there are uh corporations there are

992
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:16,000
governments

993
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:17,599
uh lots more different types of

994
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,839
stakeholders are now interested in open

995
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:22,960
source

996
00:34:18,839 --> 00:34:26,480
and as we know when stakeholders

997
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:27,760
uh do not make in in many cases

998
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,480
throughout history when stakeholders do

999
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:31,520
not feel

1000
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:33,199
that they have a voice or they feel that

1001
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:34,239
they've been neglected or ignored for

1002
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:37,598
some reason

1003
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:41,040
they won't ever inevitably fork

1004
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:44,320
that is not to say that had we or

1005
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:46,159
had anyone given the open core people

1006
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:47,679
a seated table that they would have done

1007
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:49,679
anything differently right they might

1008
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:52,800
have done the exact same thing anyway

1009
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:55,839
right but uh i think

1010
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:58,560
given the challenges of the mission

1011
00:34:55,839 --> 00:34:59,920
a an opportunity for outreach and

1012
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:02,400
opportunity for conversation

1013
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:04,079
should never be missed one thing that

1014
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:06,240
was particularly interesting about

1015
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:08,400
one of chris's slides where he talked

1016
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:11,759
about the

1017
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:13,520
race to the top among among among

1018
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:15,359
you know open core providers of racing

1019
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:18,160
to the top of

1020
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:18,720
uh who is more open right you'll notice

1021
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:22,078
that

1022
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:22,078
one of one of the um

1023
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:26,319
you know the in there in that chart they

1024
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:29,040
had like

1025
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:30,720
check boxes and x marked over what was

1026
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:34,320
open versus what was closed

1027
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:35,118
right and the sspl was defined as a

1028
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:37,200
closed

1029
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:38,400
source thing right that was undoubtedly

1030
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,078
the work of the eosi

1031
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:41,760
right and it's just one of the one of

1032
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:46,560
the ways in which the osi can have

1033
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:46,560
an outsize of impact on these markets

1034
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:50,800
and so there's a couple of you know

1035
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:52,799
ideas that we had these are not

1036
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:55,359
new ideas we thought it would be helpful

1037
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:58,000
to put them all in one place

1038
00:35:55,359 --> 00:35:58,799
but as max mentioned to do to control

1039
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,520
the narrative

1040
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:02,240
or create a counter narrative by calling

1041
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:04,400
out

1042
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:06,240
source available calling out proprietary

1043
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:08,960
calling out unclear licenses

1044
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:09,839
creating reports that discuss all of

1045
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:12,720
these and so that

1046
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:14,400
when when folks come out with

1047
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:15,279
proprietary license or source available

1048
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:19,200
licenses

1049
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:20,960
there's a counter narrative to that

1050
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:22,240
and not just reports but also active

1051
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:24,400
intervention

1052
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:25,598
max mentioned a certification program it

1053
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:28,000
could be osi approved

1054
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:29,680
or it could be any name that closely

1055
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:32,240
attributes the source of origin

1056
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:34,000
as the osi right and through

1057
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,959
certification there are other things we

1058
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,440
can do we can

1059
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:38,880
use certification to build and

1060
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:40,720
communicate

1061
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:42,400
and possibly moderate other norms

1062
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:43,680
associated with the community

1063
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:45,440
and in that sense it's kind of like

1064
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:46,640
driver's education right we can we can

1065
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:48,560
use education

1066
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:49,680
to use training as a path to redemption

1067
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:51,200
for violators

1068
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:55,839
um now i'm gonna hand it to chris who's

1069
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:55,839
gonna talk about some more solutions

1070
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:00,160
um that uh that ridiculous picture that

1071
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:02,640
michael had

1072
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:04,319
you know with the osi defending spell

1073
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:05,279
reminds me of josh simmons on twitter

1074
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:07,839
defending

1075
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:08,560
uh defending things in many ways but the

1076
00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:11,520
osi

1077
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:13,200
essentially is uh you know it's it's a

1078
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,759
wonderful organization but as i

1079
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,359
mentioned

1080
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:17,119
times have changed right there's a lot

1081
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:19,279
more corporations governments involved

1082
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:21,359
in open source and for a lot of people

1083
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:23,520
uh may not realize this osi is

1084
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:25,680
essentially primarily run

1085
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:27,119
by volunteers right you know they you

1086
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:30,078
know they're elected to the board

1087
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:30,880
there's some staff but it is primarily a

1088
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:32,480
volunteer

1089
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:34,880
activity and kind of one of our

1090
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:37,839
suggestions out there is for the osi

1091
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:39,760
to uh move away from this model of

1092
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:43,279
volunteerism and instead

1093
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:45,119
accelerate activities that help increase

1094
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:46,720
you know a more diverse set of

1095
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:48,320
stakeholders that are now

1096
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:50,160
you know building businesses on open

1097
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:51,920
source and also uh

1098
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:53,440
you know you know do activities that

1099
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:54,320
could accelerate more funding and

1100
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:56,160
actually get

1101
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:58,240
people that have full-time

1102
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:59,598
responsibility in defending open source

1103
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:03,439
given how critical

1104
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:05,280
uh thing things are other ideas that

1105
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:07,520
we've been uh talking around

1106
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:08,640
uh how to protect the commons and open

1107
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:11,759
source is

1108
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:13,839
you know uh humans write campaign

1109
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:15,280
um you know uh to their pros and cons

1110
00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:16,720
you know i'm a supporter they have their

1111
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:18,640
own issues but

1112
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:20,078
you know public shaming works in some

1113
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:21,680
ways so you know they have this thing

1114
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:22,960
called the corporate equality index

1115
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:25,118
which they basically

1116
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:26,000
put out and it basically has companies

1117
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:27,920
that are listed

1118
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,920
you know you know what are you doing to

1119
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:32,000
essentially improve the rights of you

1120
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:34,640
know the lgbt community

1121
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,280
and so on and essentially ranks everyone

1122
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:37,359
right

1123
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:39,760
uh and essentially provides you know

1124
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:40,319
people an outlet to see how folks are

1125
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,920
doing

1126
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:43,040
right you know oh if my company is not

1127
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,240
doing all maybe it's going to give me

1128
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:47,279
some ammunition to fight that

1129
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:49,040
but these types of things actually do

1130
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:50,800
work and help change you know the

1131
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:53,520
narrative and conversation and have

1132
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:54,240
or companies support some type of causes

1133
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:56,640
you know

1134
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:58,479
we could potentially create a new index

1135
00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:00,960
for what it means to be a good

1136
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:02,720
you know corporate open source citizen

1137
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:04,800
and try to get companies to

1138
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:06,560
behave in bed your way better ways by

1139
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:08,560
having a public index and this is

1140
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:10,320
you know these type of sustainable

1141
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:11,200
certification indexes happen for all

1142
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,880
different types

1143
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:14,319
of organizations there's you know things

1144
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:16,160
for buildings lead

1145
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:17,599
uh there's b corps are kind of uh

1146
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:19,200
hipping in now so this is

1147
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:21,040
kind of an idea to see if we could kind

1148
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,359
of get organizations out there to do

1149
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:23,520
more

1150
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:25,040
to kind of sustain the open source uh

1151
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:26,960
commons you know i'm a strong believer

1152
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:29,200
that more transparency and

1153
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:30,960
data out there could shift behaviors i

1154
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:33,359
found an interesting

1155
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:34,560
uh report that just came out uh probably

1156
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:36,560
like a week ago

1157
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:38,240
was uh there's a company out there i

1158
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:40,078
think was our studio

1159
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:41,759
they became a b corporation and as part

1160
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:43,599
of that they have to kind of report

1161
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:45,440
what things are doing to kind of uh

1162
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:47,520
support you know social

1163
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:49,119
good type things right and in their

1164
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:50,640
report you know they're basically like

1165
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:52,560
here's all the work we're doing to

1166
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:54,560
contribute to these open source

1167
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:55,680
uh projects hear how others are doing it

1168
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,960
and they just have a bunch of bunch of

1169
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:58,640
data they all have like

1170
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:00,240
little boxes that say hey here's how

1171
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:01,920
much money we've given to

1172
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:03,919
open source organizations out there that

1173
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:05,119
we depend on and so on just having this

1174
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:08,079
type of information

1175
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:08,720
in more like public reports i think can

1176
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:12,000
shift

1177
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:12,799
uh you know behavior um one big movement

1178
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,240
out there that

1179
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,920
you know has really was kick-started

1180
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:18,399
about 30 years ago was the whole

1181
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:20,240
csr corporate sustainability social

1182
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:23,359
responsibility initiatives and

1183
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:24,240
almost every large fortune 500 company

1184
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:26,078
out there

1185
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:27,598
has some type of team or group working

1186
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:29,760
on corporate sustainability

1187
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:32,000
they produce these ridiculous

1188
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:34,240
well-detailed reports of how

1189
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,520
microsoft's building green data centers

1190
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:37,279
yada yada

1191
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:38,880
what's interesting is if you look at

1192
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:41,440
these reports

1193
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:42,160
lots of great things about environment

1194
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:44,079
and you know

1195
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:46,160
being better you know citizens to how

1196
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:48,800
their supply chains are managed

1197
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:49,759
nothing on open source absolutely

1198
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:51,920
nothing

1199
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:53,359
this needs to change i don't know how to

1200
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:54,800
do it but it's something that's been

1201
00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:56,400
eating away at me that like

1202
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:58,560
this is something that is part of our

1203
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:59,359
commons now and needs to be included in

1204
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:02,160
these types of

1205
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:02,560
uh initiatives so you know given that

1206
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:04,480
we're

1207
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:05,759
uh running a little bit at a time and

1208
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,960
have about five minutes of questions i

1209
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:08,560
just kind of want to wrap

1210
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:10,480
things up and kind of uh you know

1211
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:13,359
discuss our kind of final points

1212
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:13,760
you know as as i mentioned open source

1213
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:16,000
has

1214
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:17,520
changed incredibly in the last decade it

1215
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,920
has moved away from

1216
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:20,880
a kind of niche business more individual

1217
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:23,839
hobbyist thing

1218
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:24,640
to big business big government it is

1219
00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:26,960
everywhere

1220
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:27,920
fridges tvs don't know why it's in

1221
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:30,160
microwave but it is

1222
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:31,040
absolutely everywhere and what's

1223
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:33,118
happened is

1224
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:34,720
some of these organizations that have

1225
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:37,440
existed in the past

1226
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:38,240
i don't think have fully adapted to this

1227
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:40,560
new

1228
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:42,160
uh you know method of working in

1229
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:44,319
dependency out there because

1230
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:45,759
with all you know this big business and

1231
00:41:44,319 --> 00:41:47,200
organizations out there

1232
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:48,560
you know they're twisting things and

1233
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,439
attacking things and we should do our

1234
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:51,599
best to go

1235
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:53,599
fund organizations that are doing the

1236
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:55,920
best to protect and potentially shift

1237
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:57,200
um you know how uh you know how they

1238
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:59,520
essentially operate

1239
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:00,399
uh potentially the other thing to kind

1240
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:03,839
of end on

1241
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:04,960
is there there won't be one organization

1242
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:06,560
or solution out there

1243
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:08,240
that is going to solve this problem

1244
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:09,839
completely just like there are

1245
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:11,520
tons of organizations out there that are

1246
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:12,880
tackling corporate sustainability

1247
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:14,960
environmental problems we will have

1248
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:16,000
multiple organizations to do this and we

1249
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,880
should not feel that we need to

1250
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,200
overboard in

1251
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:21,200
one organization um i think the osi has

1252
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:23,118
done a fantastic job and i

1253
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:24,960
encourage everyone in this room uh to

1254
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:27,599
individually and even get your company

1255
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:31,359
to uh contribute as much as possible but

1256
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:32,720
um you know us as you know corporate or

1257
00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:35,040
let's call let's call ourselves open

1258
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:37,118
source citizens i think have

1259
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:38,800
you know uh you know have to have the

1260
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:39,440
initiative to realize that times have

1261
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:41,280
changed

1262
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:43,200
and we need to do something because

1263
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:45,359
there is a lot of folks now that are

1264
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:46,960
interested in potentially twisting this

1265
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:48,400
for their benefit and if we don't kind

1266
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:49,920
of work together

1267
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:51,520
we're going to end up in a situation

1268
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:54,000
where open source

1269
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:55,040
may not be as powerful and efficient as

1270
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,599
it has been

1271
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:58,720
in the past so you know we're going to

1272
00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:00,480
wrap it up for a little bit questions

1273
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:00,799
unless my colleagues have any other kind

1274
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:02,480
of

1275
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:03,680
points they want to end on but you know

1276
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:05,119
i want to thank everyone in this room

1277
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:08,160
for getting up uh early

1278
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:09,520
sunday at 9 00 a.m at fosdem is is a

1279
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:11,118
very rough time

1280
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:12,720
uh for people people are probably still

1281
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:14,720
a delirium but

1282
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:15,919
hopefully uh you enjoyed it and if you

1283
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:17,520
have any ideas on

1284
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:19,200
uh how we can improve this we'd love to

1285
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:21,520
entertain some conversa uh

1286
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:22,960
and entertain some questions so thank

1287
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:26,079
you for about five minutes

1288
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:26,079
looks like pat but

1289
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:38,000
thank you for bringing attention to

1290
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:39,598
these very tricky issues

1291
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:42,560
some of the solutions that you mentioned

1292
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:45,520
are defending the open source branding

1293
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:47,040
preventing green washing having an open

1294
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:51,040
source index

1295
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:53,279
certification but

1296
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:54,960
there's a loophole there's a

1297
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:56,960
vulnerability there's a

1298
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:58,160
a risk a counter measure we can

1299
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:01,520
anticipate

1300
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:05,200
and that is those that don't

1301
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:06,560
really care about free and open source

1302
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:09,439
software

1303
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:10,400
will move the goal post will change the

1304
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:14,640
meaning

1305
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:17,280
of the words open source so that

1306
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:19,680
source available advocates will claim

1307
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:22,319
that that's what open source is

1308
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:23,040
that the index will become jd power it

1309
00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:28,400
will become

1310
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:28,400
a pay to play definition what do we do

1311
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:32,800
thanks tom i'll start enough so the

1312
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:34,400
question was

1313
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:36,800
uh that there's a vulnerability in the

1314
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:39,920
suggestions that were

1315
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:42,560
proposed we're proposing here because

1316
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:44,160
um people will move the goal posts the

1317
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:46,160
definition of open source people are

1318
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:47,200
incentivized to change and twist until

1319
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:48,799
it no longer

1320
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:50,879
describes the freedoms that we're all

1321
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:53,119
used to i think that's right

1322
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:54,640
i think that's going to happen and i

1323
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:56,319
actually think that

1324
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:58,960
we're putting too much weight and too

1325
00:44:56,319 --> 00:45:01,440
much emphasis on the osi and community

1326
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:02,240
uh community organizations because

1327
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:05,440
there's just too

1328
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:07,439
much money at stake to lie and

1329
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:09,440
there's no way that a small little

1330
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:11,440
initiative like the osi

1331
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:14,560
can by itself without other

1332
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:16,880
interventions defend against that

1333
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:18,480
what we need is to give more money give

1334
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:20,160
more resources to the osi so that they

1335
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:22,960
can accomplish their mission of

1336
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:24,240
labeling and making clear what is open

1337
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:25,200
source so we're going to attack it from

1338
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:26,560
that angle

1339
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:28,720
but really there's probably like

1340
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:31,279
regulatory or uh

1341
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:32,000
deceptive trade practices there really

1342
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:35,119
needs to be

1343
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:37,040
probably a regulatory governmental uh

1344
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:38,319
intervention here because the the

1345
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:41,520
economics are just off

1346
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:41,520
to put everything on the osi

1347
00:45:42,319 --> 00:45:45,440
yeah i think it's also it's really a

1348
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:48,079
question of execution

1349
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:49,200
and how many fronts you open up of

1350
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:52,079
attack

1351
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:54,399
and so one thing that i've noticed is

1352
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:54,400
that

1353
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:58,160
there are you know within my

1354
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:58,960
organization there are groups of

1355
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:01,118
developers

1356
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:02,000
with varying levels of open source

1357
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:06,400
literacy

1358
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:08,880
right and those uh

1359
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:10,160
those developers with high levels of

1360
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:13,359
literacy will come out

1361
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:14,319
strongly you know against certain

1362
00:46:13,359 --> 00:46:16,720
practices

1363
00:46:14,319 --> 00:46:17,599
right um either in the community or

1364
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:21,839
within the company

1365
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:22,319
right and i think for these folks one of

1366
00:46:21,839 --> 00:46:25,599
what

1367
00:46:22,319 --> 00:46:28,640
another level we could leverage is that

1368
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:32,000
we could poison the well for them right

1369
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:35,359
by really looking hard

1370
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:37,119
at making it you know

1371
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:40,240
questionable for a developer to work for

1372
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:41,200
something right

1373
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:43,359
i want to make sure there's time for

1374
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:45,759
other questions okay oh sorry

1375
00:46:43,359 --> 00:46:46,720
okay cool it seems we don't have any

1376
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:49,920
more time

1377
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:52,560
i would ask you to organize a room today

1378
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:53,040
here in the fosdem so we can join and

1379
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:56,160
discuss

1380
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:59,359
solutions i would just going to

1381
00:46:56,160 --> 00:47:03,240
um suggest about certification that

1382
00:46:59,359 --> 00:47:06,640
we that you think about things about

1383
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:08,879
sustainability and revenue sharing

1384
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:09,759
certifications which are important for

1385
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:14,079
procurement

1386
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:16,160
in public and private companies

1387
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:17,920
when you have an audit about those

1388
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:18,879
things then you can go on to those

1389
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:22,400
companies

1390
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:24,960
asking do you buy things that are

1391
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:27,200
have these certifications like we have

1392
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:29,359
with products which are sustainable

1393
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:30,879
which for instance on coffee and other

1394
00:47:29,359 --> 00:47:32,400
stuff

1395
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:34,079
yeah unfortunately that was our last

1396
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:36,720
point we have to end due to time

1397
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:38,000
uh get rid of applause for our speakers

1398
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:41,118
can we make an exception for

1399
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:43,680
family we we are over time unfortunately

1400
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:45,760
we have to set up for the next talk

1401
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:47,279
yeah thank you very much i'm just i am

1402
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:48,960
i'm on the board of the open source

1403
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:49,599
initiative my name is pam chastic i'm on

1404
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:51,599
the board of the

1405
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:53,440
open source initiative so i just have i

1406
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:55,040
want to thank you so incredibly much for

1407
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:55,760
this talk it was really wonderful very

1408
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:57,839
thoughtful

1409
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:58,880
just a couple like two two quick points

1410
00:47:57,839 --> 00:48:01,359
to make one

1411
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:03,119
is um because the open source initiative

1412
00:48:01,359 --> 00:48:04,558
is a charitable organization it's a

1413
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:07,040
charitable non-profit

1414
00:48:04,559 --> 00:48:09,040
there are issues in how we manage money

1415
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:09,920
from corporate donations so just to sort

1416
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:11,920
of put that

1417
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:13,440
on the table the other is there is a

1418
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:15,920
logo that says osi

1419
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:16,880
approved that we ask everybody to use so

1420
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:18,640
so one of the things that you're

1421
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:20,079
pointing out is a solution is available

1422
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:22,400
and we would very much appreciate

1423
00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:24,000
if people did use that logo to indicate

1424
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:24,960
they're using an approved license and

1425
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,960
that would be that would

1426
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:28,800
go a great distance to help thank you

1427
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:35,839
thank you thank you pam

1428
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:35,839
all right thank you everyone

1429
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:40,000
