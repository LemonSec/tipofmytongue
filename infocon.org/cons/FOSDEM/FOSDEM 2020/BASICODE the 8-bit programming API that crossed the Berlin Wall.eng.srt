1
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:10,080
sorry for the delay

2
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:11,440
technology difficult um this talks about

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,000
basic code

4
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:15,759
basecoat was a um a cross-platform basic

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,359
api that arose from

6
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:21,840
the dutch hobby scene back in the 1980s

7
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:22,800
and it's quite interesting because it's

8
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,880
an example of

9
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,800
a bunch of geeks really coming together

10
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:30,000
having a problem solving it

11
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:33,280
and it's kind of taking off for about 10

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,960
years after that and

13
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,399
essentially the summary of it is they

14
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,320
want to find a way of transmitting

15
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:41,200
software over radio that would work

16
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:43,360
on many different um many different kind

17
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,200
of 1980s micro computers

18
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:48,079
so this talk has a bit of a a history

19
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:52,239
focus but it should also if i have time

20
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:54,879
be a um retro computing demo at the end

21
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:57,440
um if i can go to the next slide it

22
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:59,760
doesn't seem to be the case

23
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:02,879
okay okay i'm sorry about the uh

24
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,879
horrible technology but

25
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,920
so just to set the scene in the the

26
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,840
early 1980s

27
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,200
um it became possible to create

28
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,439
computers that would fit on somebody's

29
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,320
desktop so these were micro computers

30
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:15,839
because they were

31
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:17,679
small compared to the computers people

32
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,799
were used to at the time

33
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:22,320
and everybody really wanted to jump onto

34
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:24,080
that bandwagon so basically every

35
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,439
typewriter manufacturer every radio

36
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,759
manufacturer

37
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:29,360
i went and built one of these micro

38
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:30,960
computers so we can see here some

39
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:33,280
examples there's a commodore pet

40
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,360
there's an apple ii there's a tandy

41
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,119
radio shack 80

42
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,400
also known by people who love it as the

43
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:41,600
trash 80

44
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,960
and uh philips p 2000 t

45
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,119
and that's the thing called the xd

46
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:49,199
sorcerer that i hadn't heard of ever

47
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:49,200
before doing this talk um

48
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,600
so these as you can see especially the

49
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,079
pet it shows you it has a cassette

50
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,960
player

51
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:57,439
the p2000t has a cartridge some of these

52
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,559
had

53
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:02,639
um had floppy disk players but cassettes

54
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,640
audio cassettes were really

55
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,920
the way of getting software into these

56
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,479
things

57
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,759
and generally also these things would

58
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,120
boot into basic

59
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:12,799
they wouldn't really have an operating

60
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,160
system um

61
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,760
they'd have a basic and it would be a

62
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,959
microsoft basic microsoft had really

63
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,280
cornered the market

64
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:20,000
for 8-bit basics back from the time when

65
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,720
they

66
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,640
had built mits altair basic which fit in

67
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,480
4k which was you know

68
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,238
really a cool thing at the time

69
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:32,399
microsoft did cool things

70
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:34,400
and um so everybody who built one of

71
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,160
these essentially went and bought basic

72
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,360
from microsoft except apple they built

73
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,799
their own

74
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:42,400
um now that doesn't mean they were the

75
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,680
same basics they were all

76
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,720
so microsoft has a z80 basic and a 6502

77
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,360
basic

78
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,000
but all these are manufacturers they

79
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,640
wanted something

80
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,879
special for themselves um so they

81
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:56,559
licensed it they made some changes

82
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:59,518
uh in the end all of these basics were

83
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:01,519
similar but incompatible so just to show

84
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:03,760
some simple basic program just also to

85
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:06,879
set like what is programming like in

86
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:07,679
this awful language um this is trs-80

87
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:09,440
basic

88
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,440
so you can see a four next loop clear

89
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:13,760
the screen and then you can do some

90
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,359
print formatted printing in trs-80 basic

91
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,720
was quite spiffy

92
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,319
um you couldn't do that in commodore

93
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,920
basics so to clear the screen you have

94
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:22,799
to print character 144

95
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:24,079
and clear the screen if you did that um

96
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,159
but in commodore basically you could

97
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:29,280
leave out the spaces so it would take up

98
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:33,359
fewer bytes on your so it was also

99
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:36,319
less readable and this is apple basic

100
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,840
down here nice and neat of course um but

101
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:39,119
to clear the screen here you'd use the

102
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,799
text command so one of the things you

103
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,200
can see for instance a simple thing

104
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,879
clearing your text screen three basics

105
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:49,440
very similar but all different commands

106
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:51,840
do that um so that's a problem

107
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,840
and

108
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,200
that's wrong we'll get back to but

109
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,439
before we go there's

110
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,879
how you've got one of these species how

111
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:05,040
do you get software in there

112
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:06,159
well you could go out and buy tape but

113
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,879
well i certainly didn't have the money

114
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:08,640
to do that

115
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:10,000
so you didn't really so you could swap

116
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,879
tapes with your friends if you had

117
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,400
friends

118
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:16,880
unlike me um

119
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,320
or you could get some magazines and they

120
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,079
had printed programs in them and you

121
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,279
would go and type the programs and you

122
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,960
would run it and your computer would

123
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:25,039
crash and you'd forgot to save it

124
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,719
you'd have to start all over again this

125
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,840
time you saved it ran it didn't run

126
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,600
because there was an error so you could

127
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,638
find which line was the error in try and

128
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,720
fix it

129
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:34,080
um it took hours and hours but you know

130
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,720
if you're a child you've got time

131
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:38,240
so these are the kind of things there

132
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,600
are tons and tons of magazines you can

133
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,960
find a lot of them on the internet these

134
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,000
days compute magazine

135
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:45,359
um creative computing um a lot of them

136
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,120
were specific to

137
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,639
one particular platform so here i can

138
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,080
see an acorn one in the sinclair one i

139
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:51,120
just ripped these these pictures of the

140
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:54,800
internet

141
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:56,560
um but um this is from

142
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,240
i think compute but i'm not entirely

143
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,759
sure um

144
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,720
but generally this is kind of the sort

145
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:06,800
of hell you had to type in

146
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:09,120
and also if the magazine you had

147
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,000
you know had a nice game you wanted that

148
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,120
but you didn't quite

149
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,800
have um an atari you had a commodore

150
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,479
so what you could do is try and type it

151
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,840
in and start modifying it until it

152
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:20,880
worked in your commodore

153
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:23,119
and that was not easy because all these

154
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:25,680
basics were different

155
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,960
so some magazines would helpfully give

156
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,720
you some hints as to what you would have

157
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,159
to change for a different platform so

158
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,120
maybe on a commodore you have to change

159
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,520
this command

160
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,720
on ibm this is a bit later because ibm

161
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:37,758
pc came up a bit

162
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:39,759
became popular a bit later um

163
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:41,280
you'd have to change it here some

164
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:42,639
magazines came with the really helpful

165
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,758
cheat sheets this is from personal

166
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:47,759
computer magazine

167
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:49,440
dutch magazine um which essentially

168
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:51,039
gave you the sort of basic commands and

169
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:53,280
how they worked in all various different

170
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:54,639
kinds of basic so there's like 20-ish

171
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,359
different platforms they're all slightly

172
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:58,160
different

173
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,759
but very similar here it's like an a2

174
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,479
sized poster i think we had one in

175
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,680
school

176
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:06,719
it was um but

177
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,919
um generally still quite unsatisfactory

178
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,600
you have to type all this stuff so what

179
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:11,680
people really want it was

180
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,639
some way of downloading stuff i mean

181
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:17,520
this is not a term

182
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:17,520
that people use at the time but um

183
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,960
well apart from the sort of the magazine

184
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,799
scene

185
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,400
there was also a scene of radio amateurs

186
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,759
there was a scene of people doing cool

187
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,039
stuff on the radio they were often

188
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:31,120
electronic geeks they were often

189
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:32,639
interested in computers

190
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,479
and one of the things they were trying

191
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:37,440
to think is like can we trans

192
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:38,719
transmit computer software over radio

193
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,919
and the first side is obvious right

194
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,639
because these things work with audio

195
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:42,560
tapes

196
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:43,680
so that's an actual audio cassette i

197
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,440
mean i think

198
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:49,039
people here are mostly old enough to

199
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:50,719
know it um

200
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:52,719
it was actually sound recorded on the

201
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,080
tape it was modulated much in the way a

202
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:57,680
modem does it

203
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:58,639
and um so that sound was played into the

204
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,080
computer it would

205
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:02,240
modulate it and turn it back into a

206
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,919
program so at first this is what they

207
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,199
tried so they had like four target

208
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:08,318
platforms

209
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:10,560
um i'm speaking about a particular radio

210
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:13,599
program which is hobbyscope which was a

211
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,560
um dutch nos it's a dutch broadcaster

212
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:17,599
had this program

213
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,960
once or twice a week i think and they

214
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:22,240
did a lot of experiments

215
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:24,400
uh with radio they were allowed by their

216
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,919
bosses to do stuff to break stuff and do

217
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,758
interesting stuff so they tried

218
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:29,359
doing stereo when everybody else did

219
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:31,120
mono and

220
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,800
um so they could make noises and stuff

221
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,759
because programs

222
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,319
on audio it's fairly awful noise it's a

223
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:37,520
lot like

224
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:39,280
you know pulling your nails down a

225
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,560
blackboard i think you're kind of old

226
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,318
enough to know what blackboard is

227
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,400
but oh here is one i'm not going to do

228
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:44,400
it

229
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:48,960
but in any case so you had four

230
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,239
different platforms well actually

231
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,318
they all had cassettes but they all did

232
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:54,800
it in a slightly different way

233
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:56,000
so if you have a weekly program and

234
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,400
you're not going to spend

235
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,400
hours you know scratching on blackboard

236
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,638
so maybe you could do one

237
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,840
commodore uh one week the next week you

238
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:07,039
do an atari

239
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:10,239
etc so this took forever and

240
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:11,680
moreover a lot of these um these

241
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,479
modulation schemes they were designed

242
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,800
for

243
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:16,159
on a cassette it's not that much noise

244
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,440
compared to a radio

245
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,199
so quite often they weren't robust

246
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,879
enough to survive radio transmission so

247
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,400
this didn't really work it was a great

248
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:25,840
idea it didn't really work

249
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,318
but they sort of um they kept on with it

250
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:30,080
sorry

251
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:31,919
to check the time occasionally and um

252
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,598
so they thought well you know this

253
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:35,039
problem we can solve we can kill two

254
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:37,039
birds in one stone here

255
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:38,799
what if we design our own modulation

256
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:40,880
scheme we pick we take one that we know

257
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:42,559
is robust to radio transmission

258
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,080
and we're going to write software for

259
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,800
each of these four platforms that we're

260
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,080
looking at

261
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,439
it was actually the four that i showed

262
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,399
before so it was the pets it was a

263
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,080
trs-80

264
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:52,000
it was the xd sorcerer and it was the

265
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:55,920
apple ii i think

266
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,920
philips p2000 came later um

267
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,439
so we're going to write programs we're

268
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:01,439
going to sell them so people

269
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,480
will pay us money and we send them to

270
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:06,959
tape

271
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:08,880
um and that will demodulate modulate

272
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:10,560
this sort of standard scheme is based on

273
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,000
the kansas city standard if that means

274
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,099
anything to you

275
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,440
and um

276
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:18,480
[Music]

277
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,959
this way we can transmit one program in

278
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,080
one

279
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:23,920
in one go and people can record it use

280
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,200
this program to decode it and use it on

281
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,120
their machine

282
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,480
um so just to show you what this looks

283
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,519
like this is how the j would be

284
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,800
transmitted

285
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:35,760
um it was a 1200 bowed um

286
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:37,599
scheme which means 1200 bits per second

287
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,480
um it had some start bits some stop bits

288
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,880
to frame a bite

289
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:43,680
8-bit bytes um unlike the pdp that we

290
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:46,640
saw earlier in one of the main talks

291
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,359
and um it had sort of a pilot tone at

292
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:50,240
the start

293
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,200
and um some error corrections checksum

294
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,519
at the end

295
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,640
um the bit would be in least significant

296
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:56,800
first divide

297
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:58,560
so actually what we're seeing here and

298
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,839
also for some reason that alludes me the

299
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,279
last bit

300
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:03,839
so that's the most significant bit was

301
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:07,360
inverted so actually we have zero

302
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:07,920
0 0 1 0 1 0 which if you're quick with

303
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,600
binary

304
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,439
is the ascii code for letter j is a

305
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:15,120
number 74.

306
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:16,720
so um this worked very well

307
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,640
and they were very proud of it and they

308
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,480
were so proud of it that they did a

309
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:23,600
television transmission

310
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:25,360
and there's a still here um of that so

311
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,600
this was in 1981 it wasn't a

312
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:30,000
again a dutch program called horizon and

313
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:32,240
on air well on tv they showed

314
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,519
somebody transmitting this program and

315
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,079
people sort of loading it into their

316
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:35,920
pets

317
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:37,359
and i don't really recognize these other

318
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,199
machines but into

319
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,800
five different machines and they could

320
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,240
load it and

321
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,920
had to do a bit of modifications and

322
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,600
then they could run it and well it was

323
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:49,120
brilliant i mean oh to be alive in such

324
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,120
an age when this is possible right

325
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,279
so

326
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:59,680
now it's brilliant to the point well now

327
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:01,040
we solve the transmission problem

328
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,880
what we haven't solved is the

329
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:05,199
compatibility issue remember

330
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,320
all of these basics were like annoyingly

331
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,680
slightly different

332
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,440
like this is clearing the screen it's

333
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,479
difficult that so these people would

334
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,079
have to go in

335
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,320
and change the clear screen command to

336
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:15,920
whatever it was on their platform

337
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,440
so the next step they took so what we

338
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,479
just saw was basic code version one the

339
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:21,440
next step they took

340
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,640
in 1983 was what if we abstract that

341
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,320
stuff out

342
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,680
so all the sort of standard things we

343
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,200
want to do a lot like clearing the

344
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,000
screen moving the cursor to a certain

345
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,600
position on the text

346
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,600
screen at the start it was all text

347
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:34,240
based um

348
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,839
what if we write routines for that now

349
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:39,279
basic didn't have named

350
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:41,279
um didn't have named um functions

351
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:42,640
um it didn't have named procedures you

352
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:43,839
could go into line numbers you could

353
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,600
jump to a line number

354
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:47,519
but you could jump to a line number and

355
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,200
then jump back to where you were before

356
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:52,160
which was the go sub command

357
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:54,079
so gosub jumps into a subroutine so they

358
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,959
defined standard subroutines subroutine

359
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:57,760
number 100

360
00:11:54,959 --> 00:12:00,079
100 would clear the screen so instead of

361
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:02,880
writing cls and one and text on another

362
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:04,319
you'd write ghost of 100 and the next

363
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:06,399
version the version 2 of the

364
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:09,040
demodulation program

365
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:10,000
would actually include a standard set of

366
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,839
subroutines for your

367
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,519
platform onto the program that you just

368
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:14,959
downloaded so you wouldn't just see this

369
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:17,600
you would see a bunch of code on top of

370
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:18,399
that which defines subroutine 100 it

371
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,920
would define

372
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:21,519
the go to 20 is a bit old right because

373
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,360
you don't see it coming back but it

374
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:25,519
jumps back to 1010

375
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,560
uh couldn't be a subroutine because they

376
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:28,000
had to change

377
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,920
that to clear the memory at that point

378
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,240
and that would drop the ghost up stack

379
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:33,920
obviously so you couldn't actually go

380
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,399
something to 20 it had to go to in it

381
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:38,319
and it would

382
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:39,360
jump you back to 10 10. um so this is

383
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,560
the same program i

384
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,079
showed before this is a simple thing

385
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,839
that prints full stem and then with an

386
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:44,479
increasing line number runs over it and

387
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:46,480
then

388
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,399
sort of goes back and does it all over

389
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,920
again it's a bit silly but i had to

390
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:52,959
write something quickly

391
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:55,680
um but this was the real innovation that

392
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:56,880
actually this this api again modern

393
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:59,199
parlance that

394
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:00,560
defined these ghost ups that would do

395
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,000
the things that you'd want to do but

396
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,359
were difficult in different versions of

397
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:08,720
basic

398
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:08,720
um that really made things take off

399
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,519
um

400
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:18,160
so suddenly you could actually download

401
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,279
a program over radio

402
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,560
and they were actually transmitting

403
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:21,680
these programs and people were using

404
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,119
them so this was all still on dutch

405
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:26,160
radio first

406
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:28,560
and it really caught on and other

407
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,360
broadcasters got onto it so particularly

408
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,800
the bbc

409
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:33,040
british broadcasting corporation you

410
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,240
might be aware of it they had a program

411
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:36,480
called the chip shop

412
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,920
which was about computers what's

413
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,120
happening in the world of computers

414
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,199
something on those lines

415
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,199
and they started a chip shop takeaway

416
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:45,680
service so the chip shop takeaway

417
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:50,079
service they would transmit

418
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:50,079
basic code software and um

419
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:54,800
yeah they would basically use the same

420
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,560
programs that

421
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,160
sorry this this is not gonna work i'm

422
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,040
just i'm not very good with technology

423
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:03,199
sorry

424
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:04,000
um i i had the sound thing but i can try

425
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:05,439
it at the end if

426
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,160
there's time or not i'm going to try it

427
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:10,079
now um so the bbc got into the game

428
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,839
the um the west germans initially got

429
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:13,519
into the game they published a book

430
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:14,959
and they had a few transmissions it

431
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:17,519
really didn't really get back in west

432
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:19,359
germany at the time

433
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:21,600
but it was big in the netherlands it was

434
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:23,920
big in the uk for a while

435
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,680
and in particular on schools there were

436
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:27,360
lots of educational software

437
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:29,120
and people call this the esperanto for

438
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,199
microcomputers at the time that meant

439
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,880
something to people esperanto was this

440
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:35,599
international language that was going to

441
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:38,079
replace english never happened

442
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,079
and

443
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,680
so

444
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,079
i'm not really going into this but it

445
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,599
won't surprise you in sort of

446
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:49,599
this being an open source conference

447
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,720
that will cause the between version

448
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:54,240
two and version three

449
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:55,920
was disagreement about the licensing um

450
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,920
and that another broadcaster came in

451
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,599
there was a third version did color and

452
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:01,760
graphics and it was cooler but anyway

453
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:04,480
stuck with the old version

454
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:05,839
but the interesting bit at least a bit i

455
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:09,839
find quite fascinating

456
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:10,880
is that um towards the end of the 80s

457
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:13,040
and towards the end

458
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,880
of the life of the german democratic

459
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:18,000
republic east germany

460
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:18,880
um it actually so in early 1981 i know

461
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,040
we thought the

462
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:22,480
you know they just had 40 years of east

463
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,240
germany they thought there would be

464
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,519
another 40 years the war was was going

465
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:28,000
to be there forever

466
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:28,560
so um this previous speaker mentioned

467
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,240
already

468
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,518
like across across the iron curtain this

469
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,560
was a completely different world it was

470
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:34,880
a bit mysterious

471
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:36,399
and we didn't know about it so the

472
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:38,160
german democratic republic

473
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:39,839
um they built their own computers so

474
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:43,040
this is a robotron

475
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:43,040
so the uh folks

476
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:46,720
sort of the state state company that

477
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:49,120
built computers

478
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,000
um so these were used but they were very

479
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,320
difficult to get

480
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,079
um so they like like companies would

481
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,800
have them in schools maybe but people at

482
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:56,000
home

483
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,519
quite often they'd have western

484
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,880
computers if they could get their hands

485
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:02,000
on them

486
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:03,120
um so what radio ddr wants to do so to

487
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,160
stay broadcaster

488
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:08,560
um was they had a

489
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:09,839
sort of 10 course basic how to do

490
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,599
programming in basic

491
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:13,440
and they built it for robotron computers

492
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:16,800
because obviously that was their own

493
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:18,639
stuff and um they also wanted to

494
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:20,479
transmit software over the radio and

495
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:21,279
they did it for robotron it sort of

496
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,120
worked but

497
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:24,560
they kind of ran into the same issues as

498
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:27,920
people had in the west

499
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:29,439
and interestingly obviously berlin

500
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,759
divided city people in the west could

501
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,360
listen to the eastern radio

502
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:35,519
interestingly there was a listener in

503
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,720
west berlin who also listened to dutch

504
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:38,880
radio because this was trans

505
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:40,560
the dutch broadcasts were on medium wave

506
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:43,360
medium wave goes quite far so you could

507
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:46,079
actually get it in berlin

508
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:47,360
and dutch being close enough to german

509
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:49,120
for this guy to understand

510
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:51,279
basically what it was about he was aware

511
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:53,519
of this basic code protocol and his

512
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:55,920
basic software and he wrote a letter

513
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:57,839
to radio ddrs saying are you guys aware

514
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:59,439
of what's happening in holland

515
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,639
and could this could be interesting for

516
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,079
what you're trying to do with your with

517
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:03,120
your basic course which i very much like

518
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:04,879
etc

519
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,640
um so they did and they were very

520
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:09,839
enthusiastic and

521
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:12,240
um they uh they sent the delegation

522
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:13,359
to the netherlands um to have some

523
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:16,559
negotiations

524
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:20,240
and essentially they licensed basic code

525
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:23,119
to use it in east germany um

526
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:24,079
now around about this time in the west

527
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:26,559
the ibm pc

528
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:28,159
really started to dominate and there

529
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:31,520
wasn't really a need for basic code

530
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:34,559
anymore especially in the early 90s

531
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:35,760
people people didn't really need this

532
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:37,440
anymore but in

533
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:39,520
in this way at least for a few more

534
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,160
years even though the ddr stopped

535
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,760
existing

536
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,440
for a few more years it sort of had a

537
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:47,360
lease of life on

538
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:51,679
um on east germany and they there's a

539
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:51,678
interesting picture of a vinyl record um

540
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,960
which i use instead of cassette tapes

541
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,639
because cassette tapes are rare and

542
00:17:54,960 --> 00:18:00,880
difficult to get

543
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:03,039
um here we get to the sort of um

544
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:05,200
retro computing part of it so today we

545
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:06,720
have a replacement of basico today we

546
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,160
have javascript which is also an ugly

547
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,679
language which is also

548
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:12,320
the first language people there in when

549
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:13,679
they go into school and they sort of try

550
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:15,039
and do little things and it works on

551
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:18,080
every platform

552
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:20,640
and um yeah

553
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,639
it's um

554
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:25,520
the to me the obvious thing was well if

555
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:27,199
you have a basic code implementation in

556
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,080
javascript so i built a basic

557
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,600
interpreter

558
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:33,280
doing exactly that i wasn't the first

559
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:33,280
one to do that but it's better

560
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:38,320
mine's compatible with basically every

561
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,679
basic code program i could find and the

562
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:41,520
other thing i did was

563
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:43,919
document every basic program i could

564
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:45,360
find taking it from the original audio

565
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:45,919
and putting it on the internet so it's

566
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,799
all in

567
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:49,840
all in github these days um i was hoping

568
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:51,840
to demo this

569
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,879
but that means i need to do scary things

570
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,480
with technology

571
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:56,000
um but basically the way it works is you

572
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,840
put a script tag in and

573
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,440
rather than having a standard script you

574
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,879
call it text basic code

575
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,480
and this little script i wrote will

576
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:05,200
replace them all with a canvas

577
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:06,480
and start running the interpreter and

578
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,600
and basically run your programming

579
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,520
here's some examples

580
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,639
um this one i wrote myself and these are

581
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:12,960
just sort of oh

582
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:14,000
it's a russian course and pythagoras

583
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:17,200
three

584
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,960
um sun and moon sort of um thing

585
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,480
these were sort of educational things

586
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,440
that you could get on basic code at the

587
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,799
time

588
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,559
the interpreter is a fairly standard

589
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:26,080
affair i've got little background in

590
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:28,399
doing this i probably reinvented the

591
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:32,879
wheel 100 times but um

592
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,880
there you go um now

593
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:36,320
let me just first show you the last

594
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,880
slide and then i go try and go into the

595
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,559
demo

596
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,000
because i'm not sure about whether

597
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:41,520
that's going to work or not

598
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,360
but this is just thank you to a lot of

599
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,960
people i mean i ripped

600
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:46,799
most of the contents of this talk from

601
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:49,840
from these people and these publications

602
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:51,280
there's a bunch of links on the um

603
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,879
on the github place where you can also

604
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:54,799
find all the basic code and

605
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:57,039
a link to the interpreter and the demo

606
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:58,400
that i'm trying to make now which i have

607
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:59,840
really no idea what i'm going to make

608
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:04,240
that work

609
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:04,240
yeah i might be able to right so

610
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:08,159
i've got two so here's actually the

611
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:10,799
program i just showed

612
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:12,799
and this is what it does it's really

613
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:16,559
fascinating

614
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:20,240
um but so

615
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:23,600
let's see if i um

616
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:25,120
now i need to get to yeah

617
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:27,120
so this is one of the programs one of

618
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:30,239
the educational programs that was

619
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:31,199
published um so we show radioactive

620
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,520
decay

621
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,880
um we're not going to read stuff

622
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:36,480
instructions so let's just

623
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:40,240
jump into the experiment this will just

624
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:43,200
show how radioactive decay worked

625
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,200
and you basically see

626
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,520
these atoms decaying until not many are

627
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,720
left

628
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:51,600
and then i think it would tell you how

629
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:54,960
long it took or what the half-life was

630
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:56,639
um well anyway that

631
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,960
yeah so this this tells you the

632
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,960
instructions so

633
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:02,720
this is kind of an example of of one of

634
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:06,559
the early ones you'd have

635
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:07,520
um you'd have some educational things

636
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:10,799
but you'd also have

637
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:11,840
little games like it as a car race um

638
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:17,280
i don't want instructions because i

639
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:20,399
don't have time

640
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:23,440
again yes so this goes way too fast but

641
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:25,120
um you kind of get the message um

642
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:27,600
yeah this is going to draw everybody's

643
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:30,639
attention also because our kind hosts so

644
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:31,840
this is um you'll notice statue

645
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:34,880
there's a little statue in brussels

646
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:38,158
right monica piss and

647
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:39,120
it's a little boy that pees and i think

648
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:42,960
i need to sort of

649
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:45,039
give it a power and an angle

650
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,320
and then so i missed you i need to i

651
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:51,039
need to pee into the little pot

652
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:51,039
over there so i think i need more power

653
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:56,799
yeah sorry i mentioned i was bad at

654
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,799
technology didn't i

655
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:02,399
uh well that's not too bad

656
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:04,159
because you have too much power so again

657
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:07,280
you know it's kind of educational it

658
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:08,880
teaches you something about ballistics

659
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:12,480
in a way that captures people's

660
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:14,960
attention and um

661
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,919
also think at this point i am kind of

662
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:18,240
running out of time

663
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:19,120
if we want to do any more questions so

664
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,520
let me um

665
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:23,840
are there any questions let me just put

666
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:27,360
ourselves back to the

667
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:30,799
oh this is not going to work is it um

668
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:33,840
okay are there any questions yes

669
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:36,720
why didn't the modulation on cassette

670
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:38,000
doesn't work on radio because it's very

671
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:40,720
similar

672
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,640
so you the question is why doesn't the

673
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:45,280
modulation that was used on cassette

674
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:46,640
work on radio because it's very similar

675
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:49,520
so the answer to that is it sort of

676
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:53,120
works but um

677
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:55,360
it was often i think too fast and not um

678
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:57,039
it might not have a lot of framing bites

679
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:58,799
or things that would make transmission

680
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:59,440
more robust so kind of error correction

681
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:00,559
features

682
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:02,480
there weren't a lot of error correction

683
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:03,678
featured in here but it was quite a slow

684
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:05,600
transmission rate

685
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:08,080
and it was done in a way that people

686
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:09,760
knew was fairly robust against the noise

687
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,960
radio has just a lot more noise than

688
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,640
cassette tape has

689
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,559
and i think that was the problem they

690
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,919
mainly tried to solve and that was why

691
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:19,360
some of the modulation schemes on

692
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:19,360
cassette didn't really work very well

693
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:23,840
um

694
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:34,879
yes so i think if you if you if you're

695
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:37,199
really over

696
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,720
um there's a word for that i forgot but

697
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:42,080
yeah if you put it away in the red

698
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:43,440
if you over saturate it yeah then um

699
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:45,039
you mentioned it worked better i think

700
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,240
that's because then you kind of force it

701
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:48,158
to be a square wave

702
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:50,720
and i think the software did just much

703
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:52,880
better with square waves um

704
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:54,230
so i think that was one you you you

705
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:56,559
sound like you did this at the time

706
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:58,240
[Laughter]

707
00:23:56,559 --> 00:24:00,080
i tried at the time i couldn't i

708
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,799
sometimes i never made it work so you

709
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,399
know i

710
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:05,840
caught up later there's a question at

711
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,840
the back

712
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:11,679
it's a good question how many people

713
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:13,600
have actually used basic codes

714
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:15,520
oh that's quite a lot of people that's

715
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:17,600
really good to see

716
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:21,279
um so if you want to you know go back to

717
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:21,279
the old times you now know where to go

718
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:26,640
the sample yeah let's try and go to the

719
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,639
sample um

720
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:36,879
well this is from the chip shop but

721
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:36,880
see my problem is if i go here

722
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:43,120
maybe would it

723
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:50,399
yeah it's just that ah hey

724
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,400
thank you

725
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:57,440
can we hear it now is there a play

726
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:01,840
button

727
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:15,679
i can try and play it here and turn it

728
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:18,080
up loud but i'll have to turn off the

729
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:18,080
screen

730
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:41,760
the quality is much better and much less

731
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:43,360
liable to

732
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:45,039
recorded the program find the

733
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:47,439
translation program for your makeup

734
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:49,760
computer on the basic open set

735
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:51,520
next load the translation program which

736
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,480
means your computer will now understand

737
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:57,840
basically

738
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:57,840
and finally you've recorded oh sorry

739
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:02,960
yeah running out of time

740
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:10,639
good morning and i can't get to the

741
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:12,480
slider because this sort of thing gets

742
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:14,400
in the way

743
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:15,600
but just before we transmit the software

744
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,279
a few tips

745
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:19,678
the program will be in a format known as

746
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:22,400
basic code

747
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:24,159
sorry i'm just um i think we've run out

748
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:25,600
of time so sorry about that uh we can

749
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:28,240
try if people are interested

750
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:28,799
to uh to make to to yeah to show you how

751
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:32,640
it

752
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:34,158
sounds yeah you get some blue if you've

753
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,200
ever heard of modem it sounds a lot like

754
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:38,559
that

755
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:40,320
yeah um so

756
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:43,389
i'll stop taking up the time of the next

757
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:50,840
speaker so thanks very much for your

758
00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:53,840
[Applause]

759
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:53,840
interest

760
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,039
you
