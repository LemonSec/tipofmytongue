1
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:17,440
and we'll switch to

2
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,440
to like to you when you're here

3
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,359
so i think we should continue

4
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,480
so the speaker for the next session

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:35,440
couldn't make it

6
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:38,480
so um i'm going to spend 10 minutes

7
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,480
talking on his topic

8
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,640
and then patrick is going to talk about

9
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,600
a related project

10
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,239
so this is connected to the to the

11
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,600
netbeans

12
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:51,038
ecosystem and i think one of the most

13
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:55,039
interesting developments

14
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:58,320
outside of apache netbeans is

15
00:00:55,039 --> 00:01:00,079
is open beans so there's a web page you

16
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:03,280
can go to

17
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:06,240
uh openbeans.org so what that is

18
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,640
is a netbeans distribution so in the

19
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,559
same

20
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,080
the way that you can think about it is

21
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,360
in the way that there is ubuntu and

22
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:14,479
debian

23
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:17,439
there is open beans and apache netbeans

24
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:18,880
so potentially anyone could take apache

25
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:20,240
netbeans as their starting point and

26
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:23,039
create their own distribution

27
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:25,199
so long as they follow the apache

28
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:28,400
governance rules around that

29
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,479
and this person has done that his name

30
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,799
is emilian bold

31
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:32,798
and

32
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:38,000
so this is just to introduce you to

33
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:40,079
briefly to open beans

34
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,520
so yeah that's how you think about it um

35
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:42,960
it's a it's a distribution it's like

36
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:46,399
ubuntu

37
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:48,479
um it could have patches um

38
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:49,680
it could have additional features added

39
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:51,840
to it which

40
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,360
means it's no longer apache netbeans

41
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,759
it's something different and it has its

42
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,119
own

43
00:01:53,759 --> 00:02:00,960
unique name it's got its own

44
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:04,159
open open source repository that you can

45
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,559
commit to potentially and at the time

46
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:06,799
that

47
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,000
the donation was initially taking place

48
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:11,840
the code was was closed

49
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:15,200
source the kind of political issue was

50
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:17,760
um this could come across like a fork

51
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,399
and it's not a fork of of of netbeans

52
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,040
it's um

53
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:23,040
it's a it's a different distribution it

54
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,640
was initially called co-beans and

55
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,319
it's now called open bean so the

56
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:29,839
question is who is using it

57
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:31,920
and actually also why so i think the

58
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,360
the very best thing about open beans is

59
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,160
that with

60
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:38,160
apache we are not allowed to um

61
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:41,200
distribute the jdk

62
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:42,799
with netbeans and that's because the jdk

63
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:45,440
is gpl licensed

64
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,680
and anything that is gpl licensed apache

65
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:49,519
doesn't want to have anything to do with

66
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,440
so in the past netbeans was always

67
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:53,519
bundled together with oracle jdk and

68
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,920
made available from oracle.com

69
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:57,599
so you would download a package that

70
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,518
would be netbeans

71
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:01,280
and the jdk and an installer to set

72
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:04,560
everything up now we can't do that

73
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:07,920
anymore at least not from apache

74
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,280
because because the jdk is gpr licensed

75
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:12,238
we can't distribute

76
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,760
anything with the jdk from apache and

77
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:15,120
this is a big problem for for many

78
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,799
people so

79
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,239
not so much if you're some kind of

80
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,080
hardcore developer you have multiple

81
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,519
jdks lying around but

82
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,599
if you're a student or somebody getting

83
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:26,400
started with java or not even java

84
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:28,159
imagine you're using netbeans with php

85
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,440
so you have no idea about java at all

86
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:32,000
you're using networks as a php

87
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:33,920
environment or a javascript environment

88
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,760
um and then you're told well first you

89
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,760
have to go and find out uh

90
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,040
some jdk to use and then you have to

91
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,840
install that and then you install

92
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,239
netbeans

93
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:44,080
that's a big block for for non-java

94
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:45,599
developers getting started

95
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,120
so the nice thing about open beans is

96
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:49,040
you can just download it and you have a

97
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:52,560
jdk and what what is bundled

98
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:53,920
with um open beans is adopt open jdk but

99
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,760
they could have chosen anything

100
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,920
um from it from a development point of

101
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:59,760
view from you know what you

102
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:01,518
run netbeans itself on it doesn't really

103
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:03,920
matter which jdk

104
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:05,040
you are using and so the question is who

105
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:08,319
is actually using this

106
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:09,439
um it's a range of different people from

107
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:12,000
different countries

108
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:13,519
you can see brazil india us are the are

109
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,560
the popular

110
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:18,160
places where it's uh it's being used

111
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,720
the most important thing is the fact

112
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,320
that it's a jdk out of the box

113
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,240
and maybe we can solve it in apache

114
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:26,240
somehow but for the moment this is

115
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,639
this is the way to get a to get a

116
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,280
distribution you could imagine that jdk

117
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:32,160
vendors

118
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:34,000
might take netbeans because it's apache

119
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:37,120
license and bundle it with their jdk you

120
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,120
could imagine azure or

121
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,960
any organization that you know red hat

122
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,840
they could take

123
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:45,198
apache netbeans include their jdk make

124
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,280
an installer available

125
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:48,320
as a way to promote their jdk especially

126
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,320
now that

127
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:52,000
there are so many different jdks so many

128
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,120
different implementations all based on

129
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,120
open jdk

130
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,240
you might think well it would be nice as

131
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,800
a way to

132
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,680
to compete between different jdks to

133
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,840
have one with

134
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:05,840
tools included so potentially it could

135
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,840
happen in other organizations too

136
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:13,759
it's got in signed installers

137
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:15,600
included and what it also has that is

138
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:19,039
special is a c

139
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:21,039
plus support so as i mentioned earlier

140
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:22,320
the donation process takes is taking a

141
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:23,520
long time and there's

142
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,680
different donations that are taking

143
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,000
place the one that hasn't been completed

144
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,400
yet

145
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,600
is the c plus plus pirates so we haven't

146
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,599
been able to distribute

147
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,280
netbeans c plus plus features from

148
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,919
apache because it hasn't been donated

149
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,799
yet

150
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:38,320
however it's it's free and open source

151
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:41,199
gpl license from oracle

152
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:42,080
so um emilian bode the person behind

153
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:45,840
open beans

154
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:48,719
just um took the c plus plus code

155
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,679
and included it in his distribution and

156
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,320
now you have

157
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,759
the full net news ide that there was at

158
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,759
the time of the donation

159
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:58,240
available as open beans and there's a

160
00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:01,039
few native additions

161
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,919
notification center on mac os there's

162
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:03,520
also

163
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:05,039
improvements with the maven indexing

164
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:07,039
built in

165
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:08,479
initially the idea that he had was to

166
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:11,759
target uh mecca

167
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:14,400
mac osx um but then you found out

168
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:15,280
um from his statistics that the majority

169
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,280
of people

170
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,960
a lot of people were using windows so

171
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:23,758
he's focusing more on

172
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:24,239
windows now um yeah gpl is on category x

173
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,160
list

174
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,960
and for that reason the jdk can't be

175
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:31,759
bundled with apache netbeans

176
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:33,280
so in the future a number of additional

177
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:34,800
features could be added one of these is

178
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:37,919
python

179
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:41,600
python hasn't been donated yet either to

180
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:43,280
apache it's it's in the oracle

181
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,440
contrib repository it hasn't been

182
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,719
included yet so that's also a next step

183
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:50,479
and it's something that could be

184
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:52,240
included in this distribution as well

185
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:53,758
also a nice feature is you can get free

186
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,880
stickers so if you

187
00:06:53,759 --> 00:07:00,800
write to them to him if you go to this

188
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:03,199
website codes with dot com

189
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,080
um sticker you can order a sticker and

190
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:09,520
you get a free

191
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:12,000
sticker and the home page is this

192
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:13,599
and here is a list of the features and

193
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,080
it's one person making it

194
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:17,440
and you can also donate to him to

195
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,840
support this effort

196
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:21,520
i think it's been really valuable in the

197
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,840
in this time of transition

198
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,719
where we haven't donated everything yet

199
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,479
and also

200
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,400
we haven't figured out how to bundle the

201
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:30,800
jdk with netbeans yet

202
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:32,000
and so this is a perfect solution at

203
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,800
least for the interim and

204
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,560
we'll see in time um how valuable and

205
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,319
what additions

206
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,000
might be added to this distribution but

207
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:41,280
in theory anyone could be doing this any

208
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,599
organization could take

209
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:45,758
apache netbeans as a starting point and

210
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:48,319
add their own

211
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:49,120
additions on top and in fact and this is

212
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:52,000
actually what

213
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:58,240
patrick is doing so it's a nice

214
00:07:52,000 --> 00:08:00,319
transition maybe

215
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,319
you
