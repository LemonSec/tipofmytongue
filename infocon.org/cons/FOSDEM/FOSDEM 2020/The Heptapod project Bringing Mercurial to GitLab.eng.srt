1
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:10,879
good morning everyone

2
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:14,920
i want to introduce you george with the

3
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:17,920
hector pot project give him a warm

4
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,920
welcome

5
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,039
thank you so uh indeed i am here to

6
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:24,720
speak about the heptapod project which

7
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:27,760
is as you can see

8
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:32,000
uh just adding support uh

9
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:35,440
for mercurial to gitlab

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
so maybe first i should remind

11
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,960
everyone what git lab and mercurial are

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,160
even though

13
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:45,440
maybe you've heard of them so

14
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:47,360
gitlab is a fully integrated uh

15
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,559
forge that's a place where people can

16
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:52,160
push their code

17
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:56,399
and collaborate it is uh heavily based

18
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:59,279
around git with uh workflows

19
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:00,559
based on a merit request it has issue

20
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,520
trackers

21
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:05,119
uh it has a built-in continuous

22
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,159
integration and continuous deployment

23
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:10,159
system

24
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:12,080
um it has many many other features like

25
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:14,799
a docker registry

26
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:16,880
built-in sso server and client

27
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:21,920
integration with external services

28
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:25,280
in short it's a really really big beast

29
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,880
which can be used for almost all aspects

30
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,200
of software development

31
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,798
so i'm not here to present gitlab make

32
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,920
this clear

33
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:37,280
but so it's a well-known big system

34
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:41,360
based on git

35
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:43,920
now speaking of licenses uh

36
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:45,520
it has it is uh it is open core so it

37
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,759
has a community

38
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:50,000
edition which is itself uh released

39
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:53,040
under the mit license i believe

40
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,119
and uh recently it's been adopted by

41
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,680
some major free software projects

42
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:59,600
like for instance debian he was using a

43
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:03,040
customized version of gitlab now

44
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:06,960
and the nomi project and probably a few

45
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:09,920
big big more and also it has

46
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,318
commercial offers it it is a company

47
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:14,958
with

48
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:18,319
a sas system and on-premises um

49
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:22,080
offerings now let's speak

50
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:26,480
a bit about mercurial so what mercury

51
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:29,440
is is well another uh distribution

52
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,720
distributed version control system uh

53
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,720
the command line is

54
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,239
hg which is just a symbol for the

55
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:37,519
mercury element

56
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:40,959
in chemistry so uh

57
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:42,959
compared to git it's uh about uh well uh

58
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,319
the project started uh right at the same

59
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:47,360
time for the same kind

60
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:50,480
of use cases like kernel development

61
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:53,760
uh it is written in python with uh

62
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:57,040
some boost from c code and most recently

63
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:59,200
uh with a rust code to boost it further

64
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,159
if you're interested in that don't miss

65
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,359
raphael's talk

66
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:06,879
in the rest of them this afternoon

67
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:10,000
and being written in python uh it's uh

68
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:13,840
custom it's it's customizable with a

69
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,840
plugin system that we call extensions

70
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:20,239
historically we had an online provider

71
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,879
think of it as maybe it was the github

72
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:24,000
of

73
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:25,440
mercurial and that was bitbucket

74
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
when they started bitbucket they were

75
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:30,000
supporting mercury only and

76
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,200
only later did they had the guild

77
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
support

78
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,760
now the big news uh today in the

79
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,120
mercurial community

80
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:42,480
is that uh last summer bead bucket

81
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:46,080
announced that they would uh sunset

82
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:48,480
miraculous support so you know sunset

83
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,840
to me it's uh it's like you know

84
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,560
something

85
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,519
something beautiful uh something

86
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,560
peaceful

87
00:03:53,519 --> 00:04:00,000
um a nice end to a nice day

88
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:03,360
right uh but what's happening

89
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,760
now uh is

90
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,720
well yesterday actually i didn't check

91
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,599
but yesterday

92
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:11,200
uh it was the last day or maybe the

93
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:13,359
first day where you wouldn't

94
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:15,280
be able to create mercury repositories

95
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:18,799
on bitbucket anymore

96
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:22,479
and what so okay

97
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:26,320
but more worrying

98
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:29,440
before next june bitbucket will

99
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:31,120
remove actually all the american content

100
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:33,440
uh well according to the official

101
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:36,240
communication the one about synthetic

102
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:37,040
uh so it means that uh we have to react

103
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,080
in a hurry

104
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:41,440
and uh people who are archiving uh the

105
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:44,240
history

106
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,880
of code like the software heritage have

107
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,440
to

108
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,400
work really fast so that we don't lose

109
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:52,639
uh

110
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:53,919
the valuable work that many people have

111
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:57,360
been doing

112
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:59,280
so in short yeah it was

113
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,199
pretty much like that rather than a

114
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:04,479
peaceful sunset

115
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:05,280
okay so now to the main subject of the

116
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:09,199
talk

117
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:12,479
mercur heptapod is about

118
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:15,919
uh bringing mercure to gitlab so

119
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:19,199
technically this is a fork this is a

120
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:23,039
friendly fork we have good relation

121
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:25,840
with the people at gitlam

122
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:27,919
uh it's about two years old uh well it

123
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,840
started of course as a crazy idea and

124
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:33,039
then a crazy prototype

125
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:36,239
um and it's uh if you want to try it

126
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:39,120
you can download the docker image

127
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:41,759
or you can try uh the installation from

128
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,759
the sources

129
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:47,280
and the big news today for us uh because

130
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,320
it's been lots of work

131
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,880
uh is that we are announcing a free uh

132
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,919
help type

133
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:57,120
of hosted service for a free

134
00:05:53,919 --> 00:06:00,080
and open source software project um so

135
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,800
this is a the partnership between

136
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,280
october

137
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,479
that's my company the company i work for

138
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,799
and clever cloud

139
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:08,830
which is a small hosting company

140
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,160
specialized in ipas

141
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:15,039
[Music]

142
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:18,400
products and that means that

143
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:20,719
well today we can invite any

144
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,440
free software project that is using

145
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,479
mercury

146
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:27,520
and especially those that are

147
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:27,520
fleeing but bucket

148
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,199
this is a community managed service to

149
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:34,400
be fair

150
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:37,440
we didn't write all the rules

151
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:39,198
right now but uh we we hope to do that

152
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:42,800
in a collaborative way

153
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:45,600
uh for now it's still uh not so big

154
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,080
but we are growing and we are inviting

155
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,840
you

156
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,840
to free software developers to come to

157
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:52,799
us

158
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:54,479
uh of course since we are two very small

159
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,000
companies there are some restrictions

160
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:57,520
there are some priorities because of the

161
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,160
urgency of bitbucket

162
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,599
but um come to us and we'll discuss them

163
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,280
and this is all public information

164
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:05,759
anyway

165
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,799
and later on we'll start a commercial

166
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:11,360
service too

167
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:15,039
which should fit all the needs so

168
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:17,039
so now the question is uh

169
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:18,159
how is that possible you know you take

170
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:21,039
gitlab which is

171
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,080
git dab and you want to replace git by

172
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:25,599
mercury

173
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:27,039
uh well first git and mercury are not so

174
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:28,719
different

175
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:30,159
from a user perspective you handle

176
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,880
comments in a comment

177
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,479
is identified by the hash it has an

178
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:37,280
author it has it has a

179
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:37,280
commit message

180
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:41,599
and at the end you get this kind of

181
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:44,799
graph technically called

182
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:46,080
dag so not so much different the main

183
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,319
difference is how you

184
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:49,280
actually pick the commits you want to

185
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:51,120
display

186
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,719
so it's around the notion of branch

187
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,440
which is really different between macro

188
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,520
and git

189
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,639
but for that we have a mapping and uh

190
00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:00,159
gitlab is happy

191
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:02,479
and it's okay it works also

192
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,520
this is not supposed to be readable

193
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:06,318
don't worry

194
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:08,479
this is a component diagram of the whole

195
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:10,560
of gitlab as i said it's a big beast

196
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:12,000
and circled in red are the parts that

197
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,319
are actually relevant

198
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,199
and no surprise the architecture isn't

199
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:18,960
stupid

200
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:19,919
so uh actually it's quite it's not so

201
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:23,440
much compared

202
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:23,440
to the whole picture

203
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:27,440
now this is lots of work and i've

204
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,000
invited

205
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,639
you for software developers to use the

206
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,399
service

207
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:34,719
now i'm inviting you to contribute of

208
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:37,519
course um

209
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:40,240
so if you like rich environments

210
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:40,240
diversity

211
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,519
integration challenge then you can play

212
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:45,600
with

213
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,959
four or five i don't know uh different

214
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,440
programming languages

215
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:51,040
uh different database storage or storage

216
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,920
systems different protocols

217
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:56,399
and even a built-in configuration

218
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,399
manager

219
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,839
so it can be complex but in my

220
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:03,040
experience it's

221
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:06,240
rewarding to work to help

222
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:09,760
our fellow developers because well we

223
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:12,399
have natural closeness to that

224
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:14,319
and last but not least there are many

225
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:15,360
small issues that can be tackled almost

226
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,440
right away like

227
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,200
uh changing your page which which

228
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,279
explain all to merge for

229
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,320
with git and not with mercury that's

230
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:25,360
easy and

231
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:28,800
you can help people with that

232
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:31,680
um so to finish uh

233
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:33,439
i'd like to just underline a few points

234
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:35,279
how is that you know

235
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:38,000
even relevant anymore to use mercury

236
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:41,600
into in 2020

237
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,680
um polymercural is easy to learn and

238
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,519
it's especially important for beginners

239
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,760
you know the kind that haven't used

240
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:48,720
any version control system in their

241
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,880
lives so

242
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,640
typically young students or people that

243
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:55,600
are coming from other areas

244
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:56,480
like or i don't know graphic designers

245
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,519
you can do many

246
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:01,120
many interesting things with them

247
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:02,720
as i said in the beginning it's really

248
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:05,519
flexible because

249
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,560
you have a whole ecosystem of extensions

250
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:08,800
written in python

251
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:10,160
which can be used by large organizations

252
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:13,279
to

253
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:14,640
implement specific workflows or it could

254
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:18,079
be used to

255
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:21,920
simplify things in some cases well it's

256
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:24,239
it's it's really uh quite a world

257
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,040
it also has uh excellent scalability

258
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,040
properties

259
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,719
uh that's something not so well known

260
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,160
because being written in python when you

261
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:33,040
start mercury at first

262
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,920
it's it feels a bit slower than git but

263
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:37,199
uh if you

264
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:41,920
have one million comments then

265
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,920
uh often uh you know it goes to around

266
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:46,880
it has a very powerful query language

267
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:50,240
which is really useful to me

268
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:53,120
it's a whole language of in its own

269
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,440
and last but not least it has an

270
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:58,000
innovative

271
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:58,000
non-non-destructive and shared

272
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:04,880
history editing capability uh which

273
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:06,800
in turn i think uh can be used to bring

274
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:08,240
more and more automation i'm thinking of

275
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,719
automatic rebasing

276
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:13,120
and uh cherry picking done done the

277
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:15,839
right way

278
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:18,320
etc etc it's really really powerful it's

279
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:21,120
really interesting

280
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,600
so um so this work has been sponsored by

281
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,839
um

282
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,800
a bunch of really small companies i mean

283
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:28,320
the biggest one

284
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:31,439
may have 20 employees and

285
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,720
i thank you for your attention

286
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,279
and i'm ready for your questions i hope

287
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,279
you have many

288
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:43,839
questions

289
00:11:54,639 --> 00:12:00,720
what is a roadmap of haptic vote i mean

290
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:01,600
it will be eventually merged into gitlab

291
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,000
south base

292
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,200
or it will be separate project with

293
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,959
separate goals

294
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:10,240
and separate life cycle i don't know

295
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:12,560
do i have to repeat the question no you

296
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:15,519
were on a microphone um

297
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:17,119
so we'd like to merge it back with

298
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:20,399
gitlab of course

299
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:22,160
uh for now it's a bit early uh we are

300
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:25,360
not in the best position to do that

301
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:28,399
right away but i'm i hope i could start

302
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:31,040
upstream patches like for instance

303
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:32,079
for the bitbucket import system where

304
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:35,199
which has been

305
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:38,560
obviously more important for us and

306
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:41,600
later on i suppose well it depends on

307
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:44,079
on the success of the platform um

308
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,279
if the gitlab people want to take it uh

309
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:48,000
we'll do our best to

310
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:49,120
extremely that's for sure um but it's

311
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,600
it's a bit early so

312
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:54,720
see you next year and maybe we can be a

313
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,720
bit more concrete about that

314
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,480
okay more questions

315
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:07,839
okay thank you very much thank you

316
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:13,760
um
