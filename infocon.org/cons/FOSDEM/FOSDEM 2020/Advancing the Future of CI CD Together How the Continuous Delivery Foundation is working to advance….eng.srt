1
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:07,040
okay

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:09,920
good well good morning good afternoon

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:13,440
everybody i'm here to talk about how we

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:15,360
can advance the future of cicd together

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,880
and under the umbrella of the cd

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,279
foundation

7
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:20,160
so just first up i'm director of open

8
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:22,080
source

9
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,240
at cloudbees i'm also on the governing

10
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,000
board of the continuous delivery

11
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,159
foundation

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,320
i'm the co-instigator of the great

13
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,279
brexit pub crawl was anyone here at that

14
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,880
on friday

15
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:37,680
hey and you can find me on twitter at

16
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,680
tracy miranda

17
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:41,920
so i'm here to talk about continuous

18
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,480
delivery

19
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,719
which we saw in a poll earlier that's

20
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:50,319
what many people see as the cd

21
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:53,360
of ci cd and it's essentially an

22
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:57,280
engineering practice where teams

23
00:00:53,360 --> 00:01:00,239
you know commit regular amounts of code

24
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:03,520
but they always want to keep it in a

25
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:07,039
state where it's ready to ship

26
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:09,439
and so continuous delivery is

27
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,720
something that as a concept has you know

28
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:13,520
been around for

29
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,720
10 years or so and we have a lot of

30
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,600
research

31
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:19,520
in this day and age about the best way

32
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:22,080
to deliver software

33
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,840
so who's read the accelerate book or

34
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:27,600
come across that

35
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:30,799
yeah a few hands but i highly recommend

36
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,199
that book as you know the modern text

37
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,640
for

38
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,799
how you and your team should be

39
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,600
delivering soft software in this day and

40
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,000
age

41
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:40,000
and that's accompanied by the state of

42
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
devops reports which come out

43
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,560
sort of every year and they give

44
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,840
information about ways you can measure

45
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:49,520
your software throughput but also really

46
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,600
good suggestions about how you would

47
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,520
improve that in your team

48
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,960
and yeah one clue it's more about the

49
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,880
team environment than

50
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,399
the individuals and and their special

51
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,079
powers

52
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:02,000
so i love that quote from nicole

53
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:03,679
forsgren one of the authors of the book

54
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,600
who just talks about

55
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,360
how the people the teams that are good

56
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,878
at it just keep getting better and

57
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:11,200
better

58
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:12,160
and we have teams that can kind of

59
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,599
really struggle

60
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,840
if they don't sort of get the right

61
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:17,920
things together

62
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,360
so continuous delivery has been around

63
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:22,480
for a while we have

64
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:24,000
a book which maps it all out but at the

65
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,679
same time we find that adoption is

66
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,760
really really low

67
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,599
for this practice and we go well why is

68
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:31,920
that

69
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:33,440
and there's three big challenges that i

70
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,799
think people are facing

71
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:38,720
at the moment and the first is this huge

72
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,239
shift in the industry which is the rise

73
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,239
of microservices

74
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:44,160
so who's doing things with microservices

75
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:46,480
these today

76
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:48,560
yeah i'd say about half the room so that

77
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,840
presents some interesting challenges

78
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,680
you know you no longer have your

79
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:54,160
monolith application

80
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,200
what does it mean when are you releasing

81
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:58,640
different bits of

82
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:00,399
the of the of the services that make up

83
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,760
you know what even what even is your

84
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,080
application how

85
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,599
how do you define it and then you've got

86
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,200
cloud native technologies

87
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:09,280
things like kubernetes who's using

88
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,518
kubernetes at the moment

89
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:14,239
yeah quite a few more that introduces a

90
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:16,720
whole kind of distributed paradigm

91
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:19,200
which um you know has different

92
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:21,359
challenges to contend with

93
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,799
on top of that you look at the tool

94
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,319
landscape today and it's pretty

95
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,200
fragmented you have all sorts of

96
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:27,518
different

97
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:30,480
ci and cd tools they don't necessarily

98
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:32,640
work together and it's often left to

99
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,760
you as the devops folks to work out how

100
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,359
to integrate

101
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,798
i don't know security scan with your

102
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:40,000
bills with your

103
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,560
uh delivery mechanism and then finally

104
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,280
of course

105
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:45,440
change is hard so we're all human we all

106
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,319
have teams we all like how we do certain

107
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,480
things

108
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:52,238
and just having to evolve that as a

109
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,238
group can be pretty challenging

110
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:57,679
so that was some of the motivation for

111
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,120
why the continuous delivery foundation

112
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,439
was formed

113
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:04,080
it's less than a year old so this is the

114
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:06,720
first fosdem it's really been alive at

115
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,239
and it's as an open source foundation it

116
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:11,760
started as well around

117
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:15,680
four founding projects and

118
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:18,320
i'll talk more about those in a minute

119
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,959
but it was pretty significant just

120
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,440
because

121
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,800
we were kind of trying to bring together

122
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,240
the whole space

123
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,840
so we call it continuous delivery

124
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,560
foundation but it does cover

125
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:30,638
you know ci continuous deployment

126
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,240
continuous delivery and devops

127
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:36,320
and we're looking at different ways we

128
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,320
can tackle problems in this space

129
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,479
so essentially we see ourselves as a

130
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,799
neutral home

131
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:44,000
for the next generation of continuous

132
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,680
delivery

133
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,360
uh collaboration and that's a key

134
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,800
benefit of like how we're going to come

135
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:52,080
together to solve

136
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,080
industry-wide problems

137
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:57,039
so one of the ways we've been thinking

138
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:59,119
about what can we do

139
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,520
as this foundation after we launched was

140
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,479
to get a lot of the the board members

141
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,758
together

142
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:06,080
and you might recognize some of the

143
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:06,560
project leads koscake however gucci's in

144
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:10,800
there

145
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:13,120
of jenkins and andy glover of spinnaker

146
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,120
and then we've also had jazz humble who

147
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,960
wrote the book on continuous delivery

148
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,400
and he sat down with us you know to

149
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,719
share his experience

150
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,679
as well as think about you know how can

151
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,320
we go about

152
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,440
solving these problems and the thing i

153
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:27,039
love about this picture is that

154
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:31,120
everybody is wearing shades

155
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:34,159
because the future of ci cd is so bright

156
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,639
so the outcome of that meeting was

157
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,440
actually

158
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:38,960
to come up with nine goals for the

159
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:42,080
foundation

160
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:44,638
and so there's a lot there but

161
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:46,320
what i'm going to do is pick out about

162
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:49,440
three or four of those

163
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:50,240
and tell you where we've gotten to in in

164
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,080
our journey

165
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,240
and how you can get involved if it's

166
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,758
something interesting to you

167
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,199
for the full details of all the

168
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:58,160
different goals and how we're trying to

169
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:00,280
achieve them

170
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,960
you can check out the the website at

171
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:04,799
cd.foundation

172
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,719
so the first one is you know driving

173
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,120
continuous delivery adoption helping

174
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,479
people

175
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:12,960
in their journeys um

176
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:13,599
when we come to the landscape uh the

177
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,159
first thing

178
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:18,160
like uh the cncf which is the cloud

179
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,639
native compute foundation

180
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,160
they have this massive landscape which

181
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,800
shows all the different tools and how

182
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,840
they get

183
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:28,400
qualified we also decided a very first

184
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:29,679
step is to start to try to categorize ci

185
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:32,799
cd tools

186
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:34,319
which turns out is really really hard

187
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,880
because things fit in multiple

188
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:38,639
categories but we do have a first

189
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:41,120
version of the landscape which is open

190
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:42,639
source and people can make contributions

191
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,880
we're hoping to get all the different

192
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:46,800
tools in there and to mark them in the

193
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,639
different categories so the main thing

194
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,880
of of what they do

195
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:52,639
so i'd invite folks to check that out

196
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,840
definitely has mistakes so you're

197
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:57,039
welcome to submit

198
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:58,318
uh pull requests but it's a version 0.1

199
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:01,039
and we're hoping to build this up to

200
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:02,080
give you know just get people new into

201
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:03,680
the space

202
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:06,240
start to have an idea of what the

203
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:08,319
different categories are what they mean

204
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:11,280
and who are the you know what are the

205
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:11,280
options in the space

206
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:16,000
um we also just in terms of spreading

207
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:18,319
the word

208
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,479
about continuous delivery we have a set

209
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:23,360
of meetups so these were actually

210
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:25,120
jenkins area meetups so jenkins is one

211
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,280
of the founding projects

212
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:29,039
and these meetups were contributed to

213
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:31,520
the cd foundation

214
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:33,199
and the cd foundation is now kind of

215
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:35,280
driving those forwards

216
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:36,720
uh meetup owners are invited to widen

217
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,880
the scope so if you want to talk about

218
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,479
more than jenkins you can do that

219
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,639
and we've got quite a few all around the

220
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:45,280
world and maybe some of you have already

221
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:47,840
been there maybe some of you run them

222
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:51,198
but either way i encourage you to

223
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:53,119
either join a local meetup or look to

224
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:54,720
start one

225
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,240
yourself so you can sort of work

226
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,680
together with other people to

227
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,840
sort of see how people are approaching

228
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,840
things

229
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:05,919
okay then one of the other missions is

230
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,440
to just focus on

231
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:09,280
the projects that are part of the

232
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:12,080
foundation

233
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:13,599
so there's a lot of cicd projects out in

234
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:16,318
the world

235
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:17,280
we launched with four specific projects

236
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:21,680
so

237
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:24,799
jenkins spinnaker tecton and jenkins x

238
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:26,240
so these are founding projects and the

239
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,479
interesting thing i find

240
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,759
um about the different projects we have

241
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:32,240
in the space

242
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,880
is that they really represent different

243
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,080
parts

244
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:38,479
of um adoption in the industry

245
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:41,360
so you take something like jenkins like

246
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:43,200
okay who's heard of jenkins

247
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,720
yeah i think some of you are just being

248
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,800
lazy so

249
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,320
most people um i say jenkins is pretty

250
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,160
much late majority

251
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:53,120
if you're doing some form of cicd you've

252
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:54,880
come across it you've used it

253
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,480
and it's only laggards who perhaps

254
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:59,600
aren't employing ci cd who

255
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:01,440
aren't using it spinnaker

256
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,120
probably early majority lots of people

257
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,720
using spinach well how many people in

258
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,320
this room are using spinach i've heard

259
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:11,360
of plinica

260
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:13,920
okay maybe yeah just just a few people

261
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:16,080
um and then over here on the right uh

262
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,040
jenkins x and tekton for those of you in

263
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,480
the talk earlier

264
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,560
we talked about tacton and there'll be

265
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,640
some talks later about jenkins x

266
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:25,599
those are coming in much more on the

267
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:27,199
kind of innovators and early adopters

268
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,519
folks who are just getting to grips with

269
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:32,080
micro services and kubernetes

270
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:34,720
and looking for tools that can deal with

271
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:37,200
the different kind of tech paradigm

272
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:39,120
so you know tools in different languages

273
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,800
tools with different challenges

274
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,720
so as a foundation we're sort of saying

275
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,719
okay what does each tool need

276
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,760
and how can we help them grow and be

277
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:49,040
useful to

278
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:50,640
to the end users who want to use them

279
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,920
and you know some of the things we do is

280
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,760
just measuring you know how many

281
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:55,760
contributions we have

282
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,439
that was a little infographic i did just

283
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:59,760
trying to compare how many people are

284
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:01,279
contributing to the different projects

285
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:04,079
compared to let's say something like

286
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:05,839
kubernetes which is really taken off and

287
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:08,719
just seeing like you know jenkins

288
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:11,120
for a basically a 15 year old project is

289
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,720
is doing pretty well and quite healthy

290
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,560
and all the other projects are sort of

291
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:18,160
growing steadily so that's something

292
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:20,319
we'll look at sort of year on year

293
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:22,719
but a key thing is we do want to just

294
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,640
foster some tool interoperability

295
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:27,120
so how do we make sure all these tools

296
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:28,800
stay working together

297
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,640
so we want to think about you know

298
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,640
standardizing building blocks into

299
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,959
shared apis

300
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:36,000
building this whole ecosystem where

301
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:38,160
things can

302
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,760
be plug-and-play so it's not like you

303
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,680
have to go and figure out how they all

304
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:44,319
work together for yourself

305
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:45,920
and then just generally we see that will

306
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,680
improve the state of delivery for the

307
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:49,279
entire industry if people are not left

308
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,040
struggling to themselves and working out

309
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:52,560
what's gone wrong when they plug tools

310
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:55,439
together

311
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:57,119
so we have some ideas for common apis

312
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,240
and establishing let's say common

313
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,320
metadata

314
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,079
you know how do you define a release um

315
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,519
it should be standardized whether it's

316
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:04,800
from spinnaker or whether it's from

317
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:08,720
jenkins x

318
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,719
so we're looking at ways we can do that

319
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:12,880
um so very recently we spun up a working

320
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:15,120
group

321
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:17,120
called the sig interoperability group

322
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:19,839
and where's fatty

323
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:22,240
oh there we are so that is one of our

324
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:24,880
chairs who's doing an incredible job

325
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:26,399
just getting people together and i want

326
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:29,200
to highlight

327
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:31,200
this full request which is in progress

328
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:33,519
and it's one of the first things

329
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,760
which is actually saying look there's

330
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:38,959
all sorts of different tools out there

331
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:39,519
and even just with the vocabulary um you

332
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:41,439
know

333
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:43,440
what do they refer to as a pipeline what

334
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:46,000
does it mean for that tool

335
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:47,600
so can we first of all define them and

336
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,040
then maybe start to translate

337
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,639
so that if you're talking about a

338
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:53,120
pipeline in one tool

339
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:54,000
is that equivalent is the step the same

340
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,680
thing

341
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,040
so before we can integrate we need to

342
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:59,199
just sort of say

343
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:00,800
what what is it what are the different

344
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:03,600
tools talking about

345
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:04,319
so again this is all in github i

346
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,880
encourage you

347
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:08,240
if you have a project to go and add it

348
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:11,040
to the list and to

349
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:12,720
to just contribute to that sort of uh

350
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:15,519
first step in getting towards the shared

351
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,519
vocabulary

352
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:20,800
okay and final bit in this kind of

353
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:23,200
whirlwind tour

354
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:26,000
is the goal of expanding into emerging

355
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,000
tech areas

356
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:31,200
so machine learning is something that's

357
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:34,720
emerging

358
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:36,399
quite in quite a few areas and

359
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,880
we have a specific area so machine

360
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:41,120
learning ops is the intersection of

361
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:42,720
devops and machine learning

362
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,480
so we've also got a special interest

363
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:47,440
group that started up around

364
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,240
that i believe we've got kara de la mark

365
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:51,680
is one of

366
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:54,480
the very active members in there and

367
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:55,680
so one of the things i'd like to

368
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:58,800
highlight from that group

369
00:12:55,680 --> 00:13:00,560
is that group is working on a very

370
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:03,839
initial roadmap

371
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:06,638
so what does it mean to um

372
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:07,279
for devops and machine learning so they

373
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:08,720
talk about

374
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:11,600
in the roadmap if i pick out two

375
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:13,760
highlights you know what is mlops

376
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,959
one it's the extension of the devops

377
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:17,200
methodology

378
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:18,880
to include machine learning so making

379
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:21,600
sure models and data

380
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:22,079
and code all first-class citizens and

381
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,000
then

382
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:26,079
things like what is it not you know it's

383
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,680
not about putting jupiter notebooks into

384
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:29,359
production environments

385
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:31,040
but you know helping people find better

386
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:33,120
ways to do things

387
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:35,680
so highly encourage you to go check that

388
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:38,320
out and again if that's of interest

389
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:39,519
the group is open join the meetings talk

390
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:43,279
to cara

391
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:43,279
and yes it's pretty exciting

392
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,560
okay i think that's all i have time for

393
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,000
today so i haven't

394
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,920
even touched on some of the other things

395
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,160
we're doing around

396
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:53,760
diversity and security both very

397
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:56,240
important areas

398
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:57,199
but um i hope you get the general idea

399
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,519
that it's just

400
00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:01,120
you know people coming together trying

401
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:02,880
to drive

402
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:05,040
things in the right direction for the

403
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:08,800
good of the full industry and not just

404
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:11,199
one specific tool or one specific vendor

405
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,920
and yeah please check out our website

406
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:14,639
and

407
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:15,920
come find come try and join us and we

408
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:17,440
also have a

409
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:20,240
twitter account where you can find out

410
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:23,040
what's happening with the foundation

411
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:23,040
thank you very much

412
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:34,399
any question one question

413
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,360
yeah go ahead i've seen a lot of overlap

414
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:37,199
with what

415
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,720
the kubernetes six are doing are you

416
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:42,079
collaborating with c-gaps

417
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:44,000
on the app definition and

418
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:45,439
yes so we do want to work not just with

419
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,560
cncf but

420
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:49,440
all the different bodies oh okay so the

421
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:52,079
question was

422
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,720
i was seeing a lot of um maybe overlap

423
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:55,439
with what

424
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:58,320
cdf is doing and other communities like

425
00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:00,800
cncf and the sig app delivery

426
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:02,800
um so my response is yes we're looking

427
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,560
to work with a lot of different open

428
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:06,800
source communities out there

429
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:08,239
cncf is one and actually in our

430
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,639
interoperability

431
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,240
sig which has just recently started we

432
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:14,000
did have a member of the zig app

433
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:16,320
delivery join

434
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,519
so we hope that we continue talking and

435
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,959
yeah just find

436
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:21,199
ways to work together without

437
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:27,839
necessarily all working on the same

438
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:27,839
things in different ways

439
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,680
you
