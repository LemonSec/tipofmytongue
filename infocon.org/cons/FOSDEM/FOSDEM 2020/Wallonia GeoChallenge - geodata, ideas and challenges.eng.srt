1
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,120
thanks my name is

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:10,160
emmanuel roque i'm community manager and

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:13,120
content manager

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,879
for the wallonia public service and the

5
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:18,080
geomatics department

6
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:19,600
so like mark says it will be a

7
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,439
little bit different i'm not a

8
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,800
specialist i'm not a geometrician i'm

9
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:25,680
not a developer

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,720
but what um i want to talk about is the

11
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,279
geochallenge

12
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:32,400
but before talking about the joe

13
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:32,400
challenge i want to

14
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:39,600
speak a little bit about our geoportal

15
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:43,120
our public special information and uh

16
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:47,920
or the related tools that goes with

17
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:51,839
the special information for wallonia

18
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:54,719
so first of all the wallonia geoportal

19
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,800
you have to know that uh how these

20
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:59,920
geoportals comes to life

21
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:02,879
there is two uh big lows uh

22
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:04,960
the the european law perhaps you know it

23
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:08,080
it's inspired directive

24
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:08,798
uh that comes from europe and we have to

25
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:12,560
translate

26
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:16,240
um in belgium and in wallonia this

27
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:20,159
directive and it's called the infra scg

28
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:22,560
decree for us so the this infrastructure

29
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,000
and what's the government decide it's

30
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,320
very important

31
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,960
it's not only to take the inspired

32
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,199
directive and say okay we will put it in

33
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,798
a

34
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,439
decree they have a big reflection on how

35
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:37,280
to create

36
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:40,798
a um a really real infrastructure

37
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:45,920
about walnut geospatial information

38
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:48,159
use uh tools uh look a really really big

39
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,520
reflection about the creation of this

40
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:52,159
infrastructure

41
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,520
and the the top of the iceberg about

42
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:58,240
this infrastructure

43
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:58,240
is the geoportal of wallonia

44
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:03,039
but if you like if you look at the

45
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,200
geoportal in france

46
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,159
you will see that there is only a viewer

47
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,000
there is only

48
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,520
the possibility to look at the

49
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,720
information in this

50
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,599
geoportal in wallonia the geoportal has

51
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,959
two purpose

52
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:19,280
the first one is important it's to

53
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:20,800
it's a meeting point for the geomatics

54
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:24,160
user community

55
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,920
so you have information about formation

56
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:30,079
about how to learn to use

57
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:33,359
dramatic duty or to find

58
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:36,480
special data information

59
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,519
where you can start everything and so on

60
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:41,518
and so on

61
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:43,680
but the most purpose is of course

62
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:46,400
a showcase for the public special

63
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:49,200
information

64
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:51,840
and you can find it on this address

65
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,839
geoportal

66
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,959
so on the geoportal you will find public

67
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:00,239
special

68
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:03,440
information hello

69
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:04,159
it's a single source of data from and

70
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:07,599
about

71
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:11,120
wallonia and all the advantages of this

72
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:14,799
single source of data is that this it is

73
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:18,760
documented of course structured

74
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:21,440
modeled regularly updated

75
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:24,879
interoperability because of the

76
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:33,040
of course european directive and

77
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:35,679
known origin very important for us

78
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:37,280
all this geospatial information what i

79
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,640
have to say is that there is uh

80
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,360
synergies and transversalities this data

81
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,079
is not only

82
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,040
about country planning or about

83
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,159
territory

84
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:49,040
it's about economy employment uh

85
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:52,159
mobility

86
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:53,359
support uh finance there is there is a

87
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:56,560
lot a lot a lot of

88
00:03:53,360 --> 00:04:00,480
uh different geospatial information

89
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:03,920
and the big big uh the biggest producer

90
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:07,840
is of course walonia public services

91
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:11,439
but you have also other uh partners

92
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,840
or producers that are federal and public

93
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:16,320
authorities so

94
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:19,519
uh a city

95
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:22,079
a province can meet

96
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:23,759
us and say i want to broadcast my

97
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:26,800
information

98
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:29,919
with your geoportal it's possible

99
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:34,320
so there is a lot a lot of public

100
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:34,320
special information on this site

101
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:41,280
what are the tools that are available

102
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:44,400
for all the community

103
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:47,520
of course the administration but also

104
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:50,560
some other users

105
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:53,359
the first one it's a catalogue it's a

106
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,560
online producers catalogue it's called

107
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:59,040
metawal

108
00:04:54,560 --> 00:05:03,120
for metadata information

109
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:05,919
and it help us create with the producers

110
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,600
all the information and all the metadata

111
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:11,599
of the data they want to

112
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:14,720
broadcast first of all

113
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,919
second tools very important also we are

114
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:19,120
a public service

115
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:22,639
and we want that citizens can interact

116
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,639
can see our information

117
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:28,960
so not every citizens

118
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:32,479
has specific tools mapping tools

119
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:36,560
or other tools to

120
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:40,800
interact to see geographic information

121
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:43,759
so we decide uh to create and to develop

122
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,400
a viewer a specific discovery viewer

123
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:47,919
called

124
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:51,039
walnut map wallonia on map

125
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:54,479
it's easy to understand and the last

126
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:57,520
tools is for developer to developers

127
00:05:54,479 --> 00:06:00,318
it's called jio viewer api

128
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:01,120
and there is a lot of documentation

129
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:05,919
about

130
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:07,280
all the tools a developer can use to um

131
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:10,318
create

132
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:12,799
a specific viewer

133
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:14,240
or specific programs for or

134
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:17,520
administration

135
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:21,840
or for the users of or

136
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:21,840
geographic information

137
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:30,080
so just a slide to to resume

138
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,560
you see there is a producers we are the

139
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,840
most

140
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,080
important producers in wallonia about

141
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:37,359
public uh

142
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:40,639
in geographic information but we create

143
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:41,919
data and metadata where there is a

144
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,960
single point of

145
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:48,719
where you can find all this information

146
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:52,719
and then we create some tools for

147
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:54,960
a lot of users from the citizens

148
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,919
to specialists to private sector

149
00:06:54,960 --> 00:07:02,719
companies

150
00:06:55,919 --> 00:07:06,000
and also public services of course

151
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:08,560
and now i will talk about the the event

152
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,280
the competition the geochallenge hello

153
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,680
why is this

154
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,559
uh challenge why this competition you

155
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:16,560
see there is

156
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:20,080
a lot of usage or uses of our

157
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:23,280
geographic information but

158
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,840
now with the open data with a lot with a

159
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:27,280
result

160
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:30,560
of more data that are

161
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:34,239
on the market with a lot

162
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:37,759
more new way of working

163
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,759
we want to increase

164
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,400
the use of geographic information of

165
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:45,199
public geographic information

166
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:46,400
and also we want to show that

167
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:49,440
administration

168
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:50,960
public administration can be there can

169
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:54,000
be on the podium

170
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:58,080
uh can uh can uh be frontrunner

171
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:01,759
for the youth uh and uh of public

172
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:05,120
and create public information so

173
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:06,160
we create a competition called the jio

174
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,639
challenge

175
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,360
the idea it's a competition for small

176
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:12,240
business

177
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:14,319
small business companies and academic

178
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:17,280
community

179
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:18,240
the only obligation in this competition

180
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:21,280
is to use

181
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,759
wallonia special information not only

182
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:25,840
this

183
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:30,400
this one you can also have

184
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:33,598
and ask other data from other organisms

185
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:37,039
private data or why not

186
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:40,159
create cloud mapping

187
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:43,199
order data and

188
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:46,319
the idea is to meet citizens of of

189
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:48,320
public administration challenges every

190
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:51,200
day

191
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,640
the administration and the citizens face

192
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,760
challenges

193
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:57,120
where can i uh oh to to have a better uh

194
00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:01,040
mobility

195
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:04,240
uh where can i find some spots to work

196
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:06,640
uh and so on and so on we have

197
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,440
we have created some challenges and the

198
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:10,800
idea

199
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:14,320
is to uh to

200
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:16,959
to find an answer uh with the

201
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,959
geochallenge

202
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:24,160
hello for us why create this

203
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:27,360
geochallenge

204
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,680
it's to create solutions that are that

205
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,120
are

206
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:34,479
user oriented it's to develop

207
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:37,120
the use of the special information

208
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,800
it's a possibility for us to explore new

209
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:42,640
tools and new ways of working

210
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:44,560
with the gis community of course we want

211
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:47,199
to promote the wallonia geoportal and

212
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:49,839
the knowledge of the public services

213
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,800
and we want to break some old

214
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:54,160
administration

215
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:56,959
images uh it's also

216
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,680
possible for us and it's an idea you

217
00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:01,040
know

218
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:02,640
there is a huge legislation and when you

219
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,399
want to to work with

220
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:06,079
administration public administration for

221
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:08,640
some some companies

222
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:09,359
it's very difficult it has a lot of

223
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:12,720
times

224
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,760
and sometimes we we we missed to work

225
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,839
with this administ

226
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:17,040
these companies because they don't want

227
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:20,000

228
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:21,279
