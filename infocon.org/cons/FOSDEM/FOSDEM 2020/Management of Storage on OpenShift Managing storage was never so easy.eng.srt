1
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,280
you can just

2
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:14,240
start about in time with ankush for

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:17,599
um yeah storage management and openshift

4
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,599
thank you thank you everyone

5
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,960
uh so so the topic that we are going to

6
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:26,240
talk about today is the management of

7
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,519
storage and openshift uh as we all know

8
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,519
that management has been

9
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:31,119
always a trivial task for the storage

10
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:33,760
admins and the developers

11
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:34,160
whether it's deploying a cluster whether

12
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,760
it's

13
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,440
doing a monitoring of a cloud storage

14
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,960
cluster or

15
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,800
whether you are doing any of the day two

16
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,040
operations you have to go to the cli

17
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,480
as we have all seen that there has been

18
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,719
a number of presenters that have came

19
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,640
and played with the cli and then all the

20
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:49,440
stuff i'm not going to do that i'm a ui

21
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,360
developer

22
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,718
working storage uh work in the storage

23
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,719
department in red hat as a senior

24
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:58,960
software engineer

25
00:00:54,719 --> 00:01:01,600
and i have been okay let me see

26
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,239
okay i have been working on a storage

27
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,479
product from

28
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:05,920
last over four years uh basically

29
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:07,840
designing

30
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,200
designing the storage from and also

31
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,799
implementing that storage

32
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,799
and how user can easily interact with

33
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,600
the storage systems initially all

34
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:16,799
started with

35
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:18,000
uh gluster uh where we designed a

36
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,159
console for a cluster

37
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,040
then we transitioned to cef and

38
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,439
designing a

39
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:26,159
console for safe and now the world has

40
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:29,520
transitioned to

41
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,960
containers so so here i am designing a

42
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,679
ui for the container storage in

43
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,960
openshift

44
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,240
uh i also love playing table tennis

45
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:39,679
snooker in my free time

46
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:42,798
and also like exploring places

47
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:45,040
food food and cultures so that's about

48
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:45,040
me

49
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,439
i just want to ask question how many of

50
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,798
you have faced the problem of setting up

51
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:53,758
a storage cluster

52
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:54,479
or doing a day two operations or doing

53
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,119
the monitoring

54
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:58,000
in the storage cluster please underhand

55
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:01,600
yeah yeah

56
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,960
i think yeah so we have been trying to

57
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,119
address this problem and

58
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,640
uh i have some solution that i have

59
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:07,680
implemented in the open shift and i'll

60
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,840
be trying to

61
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,520
demo it today i have a few few slides

62
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,879
that can that i can take you to

63
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:18,000
and show how uh how we have done that

64
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:20,560
uh the first part of it is

65
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,720
how easily we can deploy a store

66
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:25,599
container storage on open shift

67
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,239
uh so there are these are the few steps

68
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:28,160
that i have

69
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:29,599
done in the openshift cluster so there

70
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,680
is a operator in

71
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:33,440
open shift name as open container

72
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,280
storage so in that

73
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,879
in that operator what you need to do is

74
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,040
you need to uh

75
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:40,640
you have the nodes uh you need to select

76
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,359
the storage node that you want to deploy

77
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,679
on

78
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,440
uh you have the storage class why the

79
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,080
storage class is required so if you are

80
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,000
on a

81
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,800
uh let's suppose you are in a cloud

82
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,360
cloud environment like vmware or aws

83
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,400
you will need the storage from those uh

84
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,760
cloud environments

85
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,440
because you don't have the bare metal

86
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,640
cluster with you so openshift is

87
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,239
designed for that so

88
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:02,000
that's where you need the story class

89
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:04,319
class to be there

90
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,239
and the last one is the capacity that

91
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:08,640
you want from the cluster storage

92
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:10,480
so let's suppose uh you have the three

93
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:13,200
nodes and you want

94
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:15,200
i i have taken a example of 2tib i want

95
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:18,399
to deploy on this one using this

96
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:20,079
gp2 because my cluster was aws and aws

97
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,720
by default provides the gp2 storage

98
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,200
class

99
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,159
so that's where uh these three three

100
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,399
things are important

101
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:27,840
and and then you can directly go ahead

102
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,400
and click on create and

103
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,560
it will start bringing up all the so

104
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,799
back end of the ocs is uh

105
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,840
backed by safe so it will start bringing

106
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:38,879
up all the

107
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,400
self storage uh cluster and and

108
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:42,319
provide you the storage that you desired

109
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:46,000
for so that's

110
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:48,000
that's mainly about the installation and

111
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,959
moving on to the next part yes my

112
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,080
cluster is deployed now what

113
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:56,640
now what we should do um rather

114
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:58,560
we want to monitor our cluster now and

115
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:01,279
we have certain capacity like

116
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:03,599
we have tbt ib of capacity and our

117
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,200
capacity is full now

118
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:06,959
what you should do how you should

119
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,798
monitor that you either you need to on

120
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,080
the cli you need to run few commands do

121
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:12,560
a

122
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,519
df or or those kind of a command on a

123
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,560
system

124
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:19,280
but what i have done is i have created a

125
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:21,600
dashboard on a storage uh where you can

126
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:24,239
actually see how much of a

127
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,919
capacity you can you have been utilizing

128
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:29,280
how is the io performing how

129
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:30,479
how are your stories being used and few

130
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,719
of the things that are

131
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:35,120
related to the kubernetes this

132
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:38,080
particularly is a prometheus

133
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,840
architecture we use prometheus for

134
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:41,758
storing our

135
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,960
time series database though so that we

136
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:45,840
can take that data

137
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,960
back and we can display it on a on a

138
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:50,799
dashboard

139
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:52,719
so uh if you see if you see

140
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:55,040
this is a prometheus server what it does

141
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:57,759
is it pulls the data from the

142
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:59,440
different services like fluentdb a few

143
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:01,520
from the kubernetes and all that

144
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,880
and it tries to show uh display the

145
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:06,159
information on the grafana

146
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:08,159
if you know grafana grafana is a

147
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,320
chart graphing tool where you can see

148
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:13,600
all your data very cool and

149
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:15,440
and very in a very effective manner so

150
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,840
that's where it is trying to display

151
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:19,520
display on the other side if you see

152
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:21,359
there is an alert manager

153
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,560
in the alert manager side what it does

154
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,880
is whatever

155
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,400
metrics that are there in the prometheus

156
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:30,240
you push the uh

157
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:31,840
sorry uh you uh you put alerts on based

158
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,840
upon that so let's suppose

159
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,280
if your cluster if you have a safe

160
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,320
cluster and your safe cluster is

161
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,239
degraded

162
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:40,719
uh i'll put a alert condition saying

163
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:43,360
that if michael step cluster is degraded

164
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:45,840
please uh send out a mail to a admin or

165
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,240
a user or you send out your slack or to

166
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,159
a

167
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,840
different web web hooks that you can

168
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,800
configure to uh

169
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:55,039
prometheans so that's pretty much about

170
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:58,720
prometheus i'm not i'm not going to

171
00:05:55,039 --> 00:06:01,360
go into a deep into that because uh uh

172
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,479
it's not of uh story related not much of

173
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,319
a story related stuff

174
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:05,599
but i have simplified that explanation

175
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:08,800
on how we do that

176
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:10,639
so we have a we have our dashboards we

177
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,960
pull the data from prometheus if you see

178
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:14,800
over here and what prometheus does is

179
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:17,120
prometheus pulls the data from the cell

180
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:19,440
manager part that is there in the

181
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,199
when you deploy the ocs cluster this

182
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:23,440
part also gets deployed

183
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:25,280
this uh this part has all the exporters

184
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:28,560
that are related to the safe

185
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:29,758
so it is pushed it pulls for which it

186
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,720
pulls the information from

187
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:35,199
a safe manager and stores it into in a

188
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,639
time series database so that we can

189
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:37,919
then pull the information in the

190
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:40,319
dashboard and show it in a very

191
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:42,080
effective manner

192
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:43,759
and this is the kind of dashboard that

193
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:46,479
we have created

194
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:48,560
where you can see all the information

195
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:49,199
related to the time series and how much

196
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,360
of a

197
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:53,120
storage has been used what what is the

198
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,840
inventory of your cluster

199
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:57,280
how many nodes how many pvcs pvs and

200
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,119
what are the events that are running in

201
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,159
your kubernetes cluster that are related

202
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,319
to the storage

203
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,440
so i'll be showing this in a demo and

204
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:05,360
how we are doing it

205
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,960
there are uh if there are some alerts

206
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,560
you can see those alerts over here but

207
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,080
i'll be showing that in the demo

208
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,560
right now there are no alerts for this

209
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:16,159
screenshot

210
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:18,160
and moving on to the next

211
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,240
in the day two operations we have

212
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,479
implemented the expand of a cluster

213
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,240
so now you have monitored your cluster

214
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:27,280
and your store is almost full

215
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,919
how you can expand your cluster so in a

216
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,758
similar

217
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:31,120
manner how you install your cluster you

218
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:33,599
need to

219
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,720
give the storage class and that is

220
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:37,280
backed by your

221
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:39,440
infrastructure storage class in this my

222
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:41,280
infrastructure was aws so i choose

223
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,440
gp2 that is default provision by the

224
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:45,039
openshift and you can see how many

225
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,039
how much capacity you want to enter so

226
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:49,599
you said for uh

227
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:50,800
40 ib of the raw capacity you want and

228
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:52,479
it will be having the three-way

229
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,160
replication so it will total compression

230
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:55,599
capacity will be 12 tib

231
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,680
and then you can go ahead and click on

232
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:58,000
that add and it will take around one

233
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,039
minute

234
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,960
to add this capacity to the cluster uh

235
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:03,440
add this capacity to the cluster and it

236
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:07,280
will be

237
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:10,319
uh the cluster will be expanded um

238
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:11,758
that's pretty much it uh i'll be taking

239
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:15,120
you to the demo i think that's

240
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:15,120
most crucial

241
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:18,800
probably we can jump okay

242
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:27,919
is everybody able to see it is it good

243
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:30,080
okay perfect uh so

244
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:32,159
the cluster the storage i talked about

245
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:34,399
the operator that i talked about so

246
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:36,240
my talk is basically uh about the

247
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:37,679
operators plus the ui combination

248
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,919
working together so that

249
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:40,880
it can give user the seamless exp

250
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:43,279
experience

251
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:45,920
so the screen that first i showed you

252
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:47,519
was uh installation of a storage cluster

253
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,519
that is you can click on this create

254
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:51,519
instance in the open shift

255
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:53,440
and you can see those nodes over here i

256
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:54,000
have already created a cluster so that i

257
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,519
can

258
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,320
actually show you the monitoring over

259
00:08:55,519 --> 00:09:00,160
here but you can click on these nodes

260
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,600
and you can select the storage class

261
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:04,800
that you want to take the

262
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:06,320
data from and also the the capacity

263
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,399
that you want to provision right now we

264
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,040
have provided some default option that

265
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,800
you can

266
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:12,319
choose from but you can also enter your

267
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:15,519
uh capacity and

268
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:18,080
then you can click on create uh the one

269
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:19,920
caveat over here is uh i have

270
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:22,240
take taken down one of the nodes so that

271
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:25,120
i can show you uh

272
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,959
the alerts uh if the node is down how

273
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:29,839
the alerts will be popped up in the

274
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:31,119
in that situation so uh so i've taken

275
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:32,560
down one of the nodes and that's why

276
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,080
it's not allowing me to create the

277
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:36,319
cluster right now because

278
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,120
by default it the replication is three

279
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,440
and you know

280
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,880
you need three nodes to be there but

281
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,000
that's how you do it if you have three

282
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,760
nodes you can select

283
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,519
all from here or you can select the

284
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:48,839
particular one and click on create

285
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:51,279
after selecting these options uh once

286
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:52,959
your storage is created

287
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:54,800
it will create few of the parts you can

288
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:56,560
go to the workload and see all the parts

289
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,560
that has been spun up over here

290
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:01,199
so these are all the parts but i'll

291
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:03,279
directly jump into the overview and the

292
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,399
assistant storage dashboard that that is

293
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:07,120
mainly for the

294
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:08,880
safe cluster that i have created this is

295
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:12,560
the screenshot that you saw i think i

296
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:14,079
can close this one yes this is better

297
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:16,479
okay this is the screenshot that i

298
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:18,399
showed you up so you can see that

299
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,839
all the details for the cluster are here

300
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:21,200
you can see the inventory over here you

301
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:22,880
can click on the node that you have

302
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,440
selected for the storage

303
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:27,040
uh that is present over here on the

304
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:30,000
right you can see the

305
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:31,599
the status of the cluster that is

306
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
degraded right now because i have got

307
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,320
down one

308
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,240
of the nodes and and it is showing me

309
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,920
that the the cluster is in the warning

310
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,120
state from last 10 minutes because this

311
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,920
device is down

312
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,959
because i have taken down that node and

313
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,880
your data is

314
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:46,399
also not resilient so if you can see on

315
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:49,760
the right data is right

316
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:51,279
or rebuilding and uh because there is

317
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:53,040
not much of the data that i have pushed

318
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:55,760
to the cluster uh that's

319
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,240
why it is not getting progress but once

320
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:59,120
i

321
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:00,560
take it down to the original situation

322
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,560
it will be good

323
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:04,000
on the right we have the activity card

324
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:06,160
where you can see all the activities

325
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,200
that are happening in your cluster

326
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:10,240
related to the storage and whether the

327
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,079
container is started

328
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:14,079
how your replica sets are how your

329
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:15,599
deployments are and all that

330
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:18,079
below that we have the capacity

331
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,440
breakdown card where you can see how

332
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:21,920
much of a

333
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:24,000
storage is being used by each of your

334
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,800
namespaces or the projects you can call

335
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,560
it

336
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,479
you can also filter it by the story

337
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:30,079
classes so you have a one story class

338
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,839
that is being used and that is using

339
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:34,319
this much of a capacity

340
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:35,600
and also by the pods how much each of

341
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:40,160
the part is uh

342
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:42,720
taking in the in the cluster

343
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:44,880
uh going down as i told you that you can

344
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,720
monitor all the iops latency throughput

345
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:48,959
and the recovery of the cluster

346
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:50,160
uh so all the charts are here you can

347
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:52,719
also click on

348
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,760
these and you can see how how by each

349
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:57,040
project or which

350
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:59,120
by each story class it is behaving

351
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:00,800
and that's pretty much on the dashboard

352
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:03,040
part um

353
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:04,719
there is one more thing that uh this on

354
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,360
the right side there is a drop down that

355
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:09,040
shows

356
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:10,079
if you want to do a ccr utilization for

357
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:13,199
one hour six hour

358
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:14,000
24i i'll click on this 6r one you can

359
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,480
see

360
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,200
that there has been transitioning i i

361
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,200
have actually

362
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,320
created a cluster then i bought down few

363
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:23,120
nodes there was some

364
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:24,160
some iops that came onto this cluster

365
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:27,839
and then

366
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:30,079
that's how it was

367
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:30,880
so that that's about it on the storage

368
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:32,959
uh

369
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,320
dashboard part uh another thing i want

370
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:37,920
to show is how you can

371
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:38,320
expand it that like how i showed you up

372
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,000
so

373
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,839
what you can do is you can go to the

374
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
storage cluster that you have created on

375
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:45,519
the right you have a kebab menu you can

376
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,079
go over there and click on the add

377
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:49,120
capacity add capacity will ask you the

378
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:51,760
story class and the

379
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,880
raw capacity you want to provision and

380
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:55,120
you can click on this

381
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,880
add and it will start adding the uh it

382
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:59,360
go it will go in the progressing state

383
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:00,000
and it will start adding the pvcs for

384
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:03,839
you

385
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:07,040
so you can actually come to left menu

386
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:09,519
storage storage has all pv pvcs and

387
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:11,599
storage classes you can go to the pvcs

388
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:13,360
and you can see that there are pcs that

389
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:16,720
are already bound and the new there will

390
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:20,079
be few new pcs that will be created

391
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:22,399
uh i think

392
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:24,560
that's okay you can see it there are new

393
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:26,639
device set that has been created

394
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:28,399
uh and these are right now in the

395
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:30,959
pending state once these are bound

396
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:31,680
uh you can see that the reflected state

397
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:35,279
in the

398
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:37,519
in the overview dashboard and uh

399
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:38,560
and and this capacity will be increased

400
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:40,240
it will take around

401
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:42,399
two to three minutes to reflect that

402
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:44,480
capacity in in this charts

403
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:45,760
uh but that's how you expand your

404
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:48,399
cluster

405
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:50,240
so that's pretty much i think about it

406
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:52,320
on uh

407
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,360
on the management part of the openshift

408
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:56,880
and how you can do it

409
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,880
uh is there any questions we have

410
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:03,839
yep

411
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:17,839
yes

412
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:28,560
so the question is can

413
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,760
any other story provider can also use

414
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:33,119
this ui to

415
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:35,760
deploy the uh deploy the story cluster

416
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:37,680
uh right now not because you need to

417
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:40,720
have a desired schema that is

418
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:43,279
requested by the operator

419
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,000
or the the ui that i have written right

420
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:46,720
now and

421
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,360
if you do that and if you enable few of

422
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,600
the things

423
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:51,680
uh that will be possible in the later

424
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:54,320
future

425
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,880
yes exactly exactly so you need to

426
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,720
define

427
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:59,120
yaml in a certain format so that it can

428
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:01,680
pick it up and uh you can do that

429
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,160
yeah that that's about it yeah are you

430
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:05,680
using

431
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:09,120
rook yes internally it is using rook

432
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:12,399
okay you could attach

433
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:13,920
other data stores like rook does because

434
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:17,199
rook supports more than

435
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:20,160
only set okay

436
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:20,719
so okay the quest the question is uh uh

437
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:23,040
if i'm

438
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,800
using the rook inside can i use the

439
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:28,000
different data sources that rook has

440
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:30,319
already has and uh right now

441
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,680
yes we can do that but uh this is the

442
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,399
first time functionality that has come

443
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,160
into so

444
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:35,519
we have implemented in safe yes we can

445
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:38,639
leverage it to the other

446
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:40,320
uh story operators uh yes we need to

447
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:42,240
talk to a few of the folks

448
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,440
how the schemas are needs to be designed

449
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:46,720
and how we can push it

450
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:49,519
yes that's about it yeah is there any

451
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,519
other questions we have

452
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,839
yes

453
00:15:53,040 --> 00:16:00,639
if i have an um shift cluster next to it

454
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,639
i created a storage cluster

455
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:04,720
how would i when do i couple go do i say

456
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,560
here

457
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:08,000
is what's providing my resources so i

458
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,959
don't i have kind of

459
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,000
it's just providing kind of an

460
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:13,920
abstraction layer for multiple

461
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,000
cloud services and so on and the second

462
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:19,199
would be uh how do we deal with a

463
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,959
disaster recovery are there also

464
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:22,880
things that are supporting there or this

465
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:23,920
is then something we need to carry at a

466
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:27,680
lower level

467
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:29,439
okay uh so the question uh here is

468
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:31,120
the second question was how if there is

469
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,480
a disaster recovery and the first

470
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:35,360
question is uh

471
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:37,120
is there abstraction layer on top of the

472
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,880
open shift there you can do that yes

473
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,880
this is abstraction layer on top of it

474
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,439
and where you can manage your cluster

475
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:44,560
easily

476
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:45,839
and for deploying operator you need to

477
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:48,000
write few ammos and you

478
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:50,800
you need to apply those yamls to the

479
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,800
cluster but this provides a

480
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,639
pretty much a very much abstraction on

481
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,199
top of it and where you can select those

482
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:57,440
things

483
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:58,639
but what it does internally is it adds

484
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:01,920
those values to the

485
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:03,920
yaml which you eventually will do and uh

486
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,839
do that but it doesn't have any right

487
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,480
now this disaster recovery is kind of a

488
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:08,639
thing

489
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:10,160
what we have right now is uh i'm not

490
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,959
sure how to hide it up

491
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:15,280
there's a recovery uh thing that is here

492
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:18,319
so if your cluster has gone down

493
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:20,799
and um and

494
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:21,438
it shows that uh and if if you have

495
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:23,520
brought down

496
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:25,199
few of the new nodes and the part has

497
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:27,280
been start started transitioning

498
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:28,880
it shows the graph saying that your data

499
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:31,200
is being transitioned to another

500
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:33,200
node and this is that this is the rate

501
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:35,679
with which it is being transferred

502
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:37,039
so that that's all we have right now the

503
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:37,919
upcoming things that we are trying to

504
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:40,960
implement is

505
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:44,000
kind of a snapshotting and cloning

506
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,720
uh of your pv and the pvcs that have

507
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,080
that is

508
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:50,559
coming down in uh cuban it is 1.17

509
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:53,600
it is getting alpha so that's what we

510
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:53,600
are trying to implement by now

511
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,320
discussion yeah probably it will take

512
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,960
some time okay

513
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:07,120
yeah thank you any other questions we

514
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,120
have

515
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:13,840
yes okay this is only default to

516
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:15,918
provide or to deploy a storage cluster

517
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,799
inside the kubernetes cluster or inside

518
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:20,320
openshift

519
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:23,280
not to to attach any pre-existing

520
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:24,799
set cluster to the operation okay sorry

521
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,960
can you repeat it sorry i missed it so

522
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:28,879
you can only deploy a cluster inside the

523
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:31,760
openshift yes

524
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:33,840
yeah yeah because this is a management

525
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:36,320
layer on top of the kubernetes so

526
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:37,678
we needed a ui where we can add up a few

527
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:40,559
things so the question was

528
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:41,120
uh is it just for the openshift or is it

529
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:42,720
for

530
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,479
can be provided on the kubernetes

531
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,200
kubernetes we cannot provide it right

532
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,200
now because

533
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,960
we have the open shift as a management

534
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:51,600
layer on written on top of

535
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,559
kubernetes and where we can we have we

536
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,559
had the ui

537
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:56,080
available and we can add new things

538
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:58,320
where it will

539
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:59,120
be easy for the user to do most of the

540
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,280
stuff

541
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:03,520
that he's talking about or planning

542
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,520
about

543
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:11,360
you know

544
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:12,400
yeah i mean if you can deploy a cluster

545
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:15,678
externally from

546
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,679
from your openshift position

547
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:18,960
oh okay so basically the question here

548
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,280
is

549
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,240
uh can we attach a external cluster to

550
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:24,879
this one yes

551
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,760
uh so this is something that is uh

552
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,760
planned

553
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:29,039
and we are working already working on it

554
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:31,039
you can

555
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:32,879
deploy our external cluster and use that

556
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:36,320
as a storage provider to this

557
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:38,640
uh openshift due to your pods or the

558
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:41,200
deployments you can say yes there are

559
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,200
plans for it

560
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:45,120
okay any other questions

561
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:48,320
or are we done

562
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:53,039
i i think that's what that's about it

563
00:19:55,600 --> 00:20:09,439
thanks everyone thank you so much

564
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,439
you
