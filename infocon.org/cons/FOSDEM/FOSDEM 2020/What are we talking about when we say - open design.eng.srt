1
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:08,480
and

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:11,120
they're going to be telling us about a

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:14,639
very important topic about

4
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:18,880
terminology and words when we say open

5
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:22,320
what do we mean uh libre free software

6
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:25,840
all of this really important uh topic so

7
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,840
i'm going to hand over and say

8
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:32,480
hi good morning uh so this introduction

9
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,000
made it look really serious we'll try to

10
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:37,040
make it a bit more simple

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,800
we hope uh manufacturing peninte is our

12
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:41,040
design studio we started

13
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:43,680
10 years ago and since the beginning we

14
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:47,200
have been using free software

15
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:48,640
we use open licenses and we've been

16
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,280
thinking quite a lot about

17
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,680
what it means to change the tools change

18
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,079
the

19
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,120
the methods of work and that's why

20
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:58,320
terminology

21
00:00:55,120 --> 00:01:00,160
means means so much to us we co-edited

22
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:03,039
the libra graphics magazine which

23
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:04,000
was a print publication about design and

24
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:07,119
for designers

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,400
using free software and

26
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:11,200
this background might give you an idea

27
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,760
why

28
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,759
why we want to to talk about open design

29
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:18,799
and other terms

30
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:21,680
related to our practice so we

31
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:23,119
we found this need to address the issue

32
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,439
of terminology

33
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:26,640
and try to find good ways to explain

34
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:29,439
what we are doing

35
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,360
and why we are doing it and so we need

36
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:34,158
to kind of figure out

37
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:35,680
uh one word or two words or three words

38
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:38,960
i don't know that could easily

39
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:41,840
explain this idea of

40
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,158
of engaging with uh with different kind

41
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,159
of

42
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:49,759
tools so the first issue we found is

43
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:50,399
the word design design is a very nuanced

44
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:52,640
word

45
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:54,320
it can mean a lot of things you can be

46
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:57,600
talking about product design

47
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:58,398
graphic design interface design web

48
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,839
design

49
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:03,439
design for print so there's a lot of

50
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:06,399
different types of design

51
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:07,199
and this is where we come from is our

52
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:10,720
background

53
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:14,239
and it's already a problematic one

54
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,959
and we because we are using different

55
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:18,080
tools

56
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:22,080
we we kind of look for

57
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,879
uh terms that we can use to describe our

58
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,000
work

59
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:27,440
and one of them is open and it's one of

60
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,480
the

61
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,519
the things that we see in publications

62
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,760
and in articles

63
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:34,959
this idea of open design or designing in

64
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:38,399
the open

65
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:39,280
and we try to see how we relate to this

66
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,400
description

67
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:44,640
of open design and we go

68
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,720
we decided to go to wikipedia as a way

69
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,000
to find the definition of what could be

70
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,239
open design

71
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,280
and from the wikipedia page you can see

72
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:54,800
that

73
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:57,920
they have a very concrete uh definition

74
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:02,080
for open design which is uh

75
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:05,280
related to open hardware and systems

76
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:08,959
so it's a very straightforward

77
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:12,800
and not so much related to

78
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:16,080
what we are trying to do

79
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:18,560
uh and we kind of figure out that

80
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,280
open is also a difficult word it's a

81
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,760
word that

82
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:24,400
has no meaning anymore in a way because

83
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:26,798
it's used in so many different contexts

84
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,159
that you cannot really tell what people

85
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:32,720
are talking about

86
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:35,920
for example there's this designer that

87
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:38,640
just started redesigning his blog and he

88
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,760
uh uses the term uh designing in the

89
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:43,040
open

90
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:45,280
and he's using it in in a

91
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:47,760
in a way that makes sense because he is

92
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:51,519
writing about the process

93
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:54,319
but not so much in the way that we would

94
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:55,040
relate to the word open so it's a

95
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:57,119
possible

96
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,480
meaning of the word but maybe not the

97
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,680
one we

98
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:04,560
we would go for and then another example

99
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,599
if you look at the mozilla branding uh

100
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,519
process

101
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:11,200
they they use the word open design so to

102
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:13,680
to take care of the redesign of their

103
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:16,560
logo they started this blog

104
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:18,639
and they tried to come up with ways to

105
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,839
open the design process so it's about

106
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:23,199
being transparent

107
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:25,599
and inclusive so yet another

108
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:26,639
context where you can use the word open

109
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,960
but

110
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:29,840
it doesn't relate to tools or to

111
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:34,000
licenses

112
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:37,198
it's just about the process

113
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,199
uh so

114
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:43,680
ah and what they did was uh so i think

115
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:46,320
they started in 2016

116
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,320
and their first approach was to present

117
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,919
uh several possibilities for the new

118
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:52,479
redesign of their logo

119
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:54,159
and have the community vote and give

120
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:57,039
feedback on these logos

121
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:59,120
so this was a possibility to to kind of

122
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:02,320
change the design process and make it

123
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:04,960
a bit more inclusive and of course

124
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:06,080
it was it didn't work that well and they

125
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,400
are trying different

126
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:10,080
approaches now but still there's no

127
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:13,120
connection to the tools

128
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:16,479
and we kind of feel that

129
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,880
it's lacking a little bit so another

130
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:20,159
term

131
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:23,680
that we find often as well

132
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:25,840
is the term open source design

133
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,840
and

134
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:32,560
and uh and we've been thinking about

135
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,440
okay could this be a good way to

136
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,639
describe what

137
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:38,000
what we're talking about uh so last year

138
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:41,039
we gave a talk at the library

139
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,919
graphics meeting where we tried well

140
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:44,880
where our idea was to come up with a def

141
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:47,198
um

142
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,400
a term that could describe the design

143
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:51,680
practice where you

144
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:53,599
incorporate free software and different

145
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,600
methods for collaboration where you use

146
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,680
open formats

147
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,960
and we proposed to come up with this

148
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,520
term and

149
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,159
the the people in the libor graphics

150
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,479
meeting

151
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,759
launched the poll with the three options

152
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:07,758
that we

153
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:10,000
we spoke about in our talk so libra

154
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:10,960
design floss design and open source

155
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,360
design

156
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:15,120
and it was interesting for us to see

157
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,199
that a lot of people that were in the

158
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,520
conference wanted to speak with us about

159
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:20,400
this

160
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,719
issue and also people that weren't there

161
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,758
but

162
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,880
saw the the toot uh wanted to give their

163
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:28,400
opinion about this

164
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:31,120
idea so we kind of felt okay it's not

165
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,919
only us that are looking for a way to to

166
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,479
address this

167
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:36,400
issue and it's definitely something we

168
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:40,159
need to talk about because there's not

169
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:43,679
a simple way to put it the terms have

170
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:46,960
many nuances and we need to

171
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:50,000
address that and from this talk

172
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:52,638
we kind of a bit gave

173
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,039
up on trying to come up with a solution

174
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:56,160
that

175
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:59,280
fits uh everyone

176
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,000
uh but open source is a term that has a

177
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:04,719
very

178
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:07,440
uh a very big um

179
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,240
it's a loaded term as a slide says

180
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,240
because

181
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,280
it has been put forward for political

182
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,400
reasons and

183
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:15,679
we don't want to talk a lot about it but

184
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,840
if you want to read

185
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:20,080
there's this really good article by

186
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:23,198
afghani morosov

187
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:24,000
and he explains what why open source was

188
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:27,440
put forward

189
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,759
and what is the the context in which the

190
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:32,000
word appears and

191
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:35,520
what it means all links will share at

192
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:39,039
the end for these references

193
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:41,758
ah so open source and

194
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:42,479
again we decided to go online and search

195
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:44,720
okay what

196
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:45,520
can we find if we search for open source

197
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,240
design

198
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,799
because if we incorporate this term open

199
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,479
source

200
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:54,560
into the idea of design we think okay

201
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:56,000
there must be a connection to tools and

202
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,879
two ways of doing

203
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,240
and one of the first results is the open

204
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:03,599
design foundation

205
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:06,080
which has uh their own manifesto

206
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:08,800
which they're which they uh call the

207
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:11,039
open source design manifesto

208
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,479
and this is just the first a first draft

209
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:14,878
that they published

210
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:15,919
but it doesn't mention anything about

211
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:19,440
tools

212
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:22,719
or ways of uh of working

213
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:24,160
uh it kind it kind of focus on the idea

214
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:27,440
of trying to be more

215
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:30,160
open but again open

216
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:33,198
is such a difficult term what do they

217
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,199
really mean by this

218
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:40,719
and and there's nothing about

219
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:43,599
tools or licenses or any kind of

220
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:45,760
connection to the to the world of

221
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:49,040
software

222
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:50,319
uh and for us uh when you use the term

223
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,640
open source design

224
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,480
we think it definitely means that you

225
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:58,080
are in some way involved

226
00:08:54,480 --> 00:09:00,640
with the libra and open source software

227
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,680
either because you use the tools because

228
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:04,720
you use

229
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:07,760
openly available assets so we mean

230
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:10,880
fonts that are under open licenses

231
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:11,920
or images that are under also open

232
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:14,959
licenses

233
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:16,959
that you share your work under standard

234
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:18,800
formats so you're not sharing the work

235
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:21,439
with proprietary files

236
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,160
that will make other collaborators may

237
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,959
be not

238
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:26,240
able to open your files so that's really

239
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:29,680
important

240
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:35,920
and that whenever you can you share

241
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:36,640
you share what you do with open licenses

242
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:39,199
it's a

243
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,839
um just also as a footnote because one

244
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,760
of the

245
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,760
details that we found when we talk about

246
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,040
open processes in design is uh

247
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,800
collaboration

248
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,560
and when we were preparing these slides

249
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:50,560
we were talking a lot like

250
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:52,399
yeah but there's a lot of projects where

251
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,920
we release everything but we don't

252
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:54,240
collaborate we're working by ourselves

253
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,199
and

254
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,000
like people might pick it up so then we

255
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,959
kind of came

256
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,079
up with an idea that collaboration is

257
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:04,000
not

258
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:05,760
it's not part of the necessarily of the

259
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,680
open design process but allowing for

260
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,760
collaboration is the basic premise

261
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:12,079
which is why we use all these principles

262
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:15,040
to actually allow people to collaborate

263
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:16,880
um without having to knock at your door

264
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:19,439
ask for authorization and so on

265
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:21,600
so after talking about this confusion

266
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:24,079
with terms and what are we talking about

267
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:27,200
when we talk about open source design

268
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:27,760
um we come from well we come from the

269
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,720
design

270
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:32,560
world of things we fell in love with uh

271
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:36,079
free culture and free software

272
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:38,800
and now for the second part

273
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:40,959
we have some considerations about the

274
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:44,399
role of the designer in this process

275
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:46,800
and how things work

276
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:47,600
so bringing great design to open source

277
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,680
software

278
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,440
you might recognize this if you're part

279
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:53,439
of the community is actually the tagline

280
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:58,560
of the open source design website

281
00:10:53,440 --> 00:11:01,120
um and we'd like to start here um for um

282
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:02,399
to think together about how uh what this

283
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,560
actually means and what kind of

284
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:07,519
perspectives are at play here

285
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:08,719
and uh the first thing that jumps to us

286
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:12,320
that jumped to us with the

287
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:14,800
with this uh sentence is this idea that

288
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,760
design and software uh design and

289
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,160
development are

290
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:20,240
completely separate like are seen as

291
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,800
layers that we want to bring together

292
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:24,720
but

293
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:26,560
that are fundamentally separate um

294
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,800
i'm very sure and we don't want to be

295
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:30,479
snarky in saying that this has an agenda

296
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,240
in the slogan

297
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,240
but as a it serves as a good

298
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:36,079
illustration to a problem that's

299
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:38,240
present not just in open source design

300
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:40,079
but in design in general

301
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,480
and the fact that design is usually

302
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:45,599
self-contained in its own

303
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:48,160
container and we

304
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,120
we kind of struggle a struggle a bit

305
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,279
with this notion

306
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,399
even though we might be guilty of this

307
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:54,560
as well

308
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:56,000
but we wanted to to run through this

309
00:11:54,560 --> 00:12:00,638
idea that design

310
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:03,360
and the software the tool ecosystem

311
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:03,760
are really seen as separate uh layers

312
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,920
that

313
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:07,680
we want to kind of bring together but

314
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:10,479
they're still separate you bring the

315
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:12,880
design to the software

316
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,079
this and there are some notions and this

317
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:16,959
is not a quote from

318
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:18,160
anywhere actually but something that we

319
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:21,599
heard in different

320
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:23,680
words in several

321
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,600
occasions which is the idea that we want

322
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,880
to make the tool sexier and that's the

323
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:30,160
designer role

324
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:32,480
um well sexy is also a loaded

325
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:34,319
objective of course but this idea that

326
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,160
tools uh

327
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:38,560
need to become prettier they need to

328
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:40,240
become more friendly and that's the

329
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:44,160
designer's role to

330
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:47,360
to actually fulfill that mission

331
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:51,040
at the same time for this goal

332
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:51,440
we also find a few instances of applying

333
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,680
the

334
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,720
notion of what an interface should be

335
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:57,040
based on

336
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,320
what is a mainstream conception that you

337
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,959
can find for instance in

338
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,839
material design or in the latest design

339
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:05,040
systems

340
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:05,360
talk this idea of a very clear mission

341
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,680
for

342
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,720
any kind of interface it is a single

343
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:12,560
one-way path

344
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:16,079
towards user-friendliness and interface

345
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:18,239
disappearing which is we feel the need

346
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:20,160
to remind just one perspective that

347
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,160
doesn't need to be applied to everything

348
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,439
specifically to free and open source

349
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:26,240
software

350
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:27,760
and what we miss with this approach of

351
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,680
making everything and perfecting

352
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:31,040
making everything better is the notion

353
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:33,599
of an artistic

354
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,959
experimentation on interface and on what

355
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:39,120
a tool can be

356
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:41,439
um for instance um this is a

357
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,480
visualization and an actual interface

358
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,959
for the git

359
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,079
repository of belgian design studio open

360
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:49,359
source publishing

361
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:51,120
where they publish um their their own

362
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:53,279
they have been one of the first design

363
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:55,120
studios to actually incorporate

364
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:56,720
free and open source software and

365
00:13:55,120 --> 00:14:00,000
principles into their practice

366
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:01,839
in a holistic way that is not just

367
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,440
using the tools to make traditional

368
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:06,240
design but really

369
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:07,600
um switching and creating new design

370
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:10,079
processes based on

371
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,519
free culture and free software and this

372
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:13,760
is the new version and

373
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:14,560
what we really enjoy about this is that

374
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:18,160
it shows

375
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:19,439
how um you were used to github and

376
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:21,680
gitlab and gt

377
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,760
and they now by looking at this we

378
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:25,839
realize well there's so many interface

379
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,880
paradigms that are being used that we

380
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:30,079
are not questioning

381
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:32,079
at all and maybe it's a good thing to do

382
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:34,399
as a designer to also question

383
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:35,519
why we are trying to streamline things

384
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:37,440
so much maybe

385
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:39,120
making things complicated is also a

386
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,959
possible answer

387
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:43,120
um and of course if you come from the

388
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:45,599
design world this is a

389
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,399
no none absolute no nonsense for you

390
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,199
because uh

391
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:49,920
we are not just operators of tools uh we

392
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:52,800
are not just

393
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:54,319
uh creators of graphical assets and we

394
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:58,240
are not um

395
00:14:54,320 --> 00:15:00,720
usability tech technicians

396
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:02,079
we like to see it as we address problems

397
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,320
uh we don't even

398
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:05,680
want to affirm that we solve them

399
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,959
because sometimes you don't and

400
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,880
sometimes

401
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:10,239
a good question is better than a

402
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:13,600
mediocre answer

403
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:16,480
so sometimes it's worth thinking maybe

404
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:18,079
we don't want to solve um solve the

405
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,120
problems but rather place them in the

406
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:21,199
spotlight which

407
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,800
it's kind of what we're doing here so

408
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:23,279
i'm spoiling the end for you we won't

409
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,760
have

410
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:26,560
a specific answer for the terminology

411
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:29,839
and for

412
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:33,439
what open source design could be

413
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:35,680
perhaps morphed to but we

414
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,600
we are really keen on talking about the

415
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:39,120
the design process and this is another

416
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,440
thing that

417
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:43,519
we kind of would like to make the point

418
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:45,199
since we've been working also with free

419
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:46,560
software developers and also

420
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:48,079
contributing to tools

421
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:50,000
and there's this notion that if the

422
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:51,040
designer doesn't come well then there is

423
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,800
no design

424
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:55,120
and that's not true well there is design

425
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,079
developers are making design choices on

426
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,079
every

427
00:15:56,079 --> 00:16:00,239
most well not every but most lines of

428
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:01,680
code at the point where you place a

429
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,639
button somewhere you're designing you're

430
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,479
making a decision

431
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:05,920
where it should go and you're making

432
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:09,360
strong decisions on

433
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:11,759
what your application will be like

434
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:13,120
and this is important for us

435
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:15,279
specifically for us to

436
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,160
keep in mind all the time as designers

437
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:18,079
is that

438
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:19,439
it's not that we are bringing design to

439
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:21,279
things it's just that we are bringing

440
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:23,199
our own design perspective to

441
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:25,360
something that already incorporates its

442
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:25,359
own

443
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,040
and this is visible for instance we like

444
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:31,279
to quote the

445
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:33,120
earlier versions of font forge this is a

446
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:37,439
free software font editor which

447
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:39,279
is um from many sites every time we try

448
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,399
to show this to students to colleagues

449
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:43,439
like oh it's so ugly

450
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:44,560
the interface um and it helps to know

451
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,399
the backstory

452
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:48,479
i mean it's not just ugly because the

453
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:50,639
developer doesn't care about design it's

454
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:54,160
ugly because the developer is colorblind

455
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:56,480
so he really needed a high contrast

456
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:57,279
interface and he designed the program

457
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:00,560
around that

458
00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:03,920
specific design need um right now it's

459
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:04,639
the the interface is more polished but

460
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:08,639
this

461
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:10,480
um reluctance to deal with an ugly

462
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,319
interface actually made it really hard

463
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,760
for us to convince people that this was

464
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:16,799
indeed the best

465
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:20,799
font editor uh proprietary

466
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:23,520
or not that there is around and um

467
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:24,639
even even then um after knowing about

468
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,319
the story and after

469
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,760
actually telling people this is why i

470
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:30,240
mean this is not just because

471
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:31,440
the developer is dumb um this is why the

472
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,360
program looks like this

473
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,880
and this is laid out which is an amazing

474
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:37,039
um page

475
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:38,000
layout tool like completely next

476
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:40,000
generation

477
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,240
in the sense that it has tools and

478
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,120
effect and

479
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:46,559
and some gadgets that aren't present in

480
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,719
any of them

481
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:49,918
and if you're conservative in if you

482
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:54,320
come here the first thing you

483
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:56,080
say is that it's ugly and uh

484
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,840
while we get where that criticism might

485
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:59,280
come from it also comes from a very

486
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:02,399
personal perspective

487
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:04,080
by the author tom leuchner who

488
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,440
really knows what he wants from his

489
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:07,280
program because he's designing this

490
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:08,160
mostly for himself and for his own

491
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:10,639
publications

492
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:12,240
and then makes it uh available on the

493
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,120
other hand yeah we recommend that you

494
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,120
watch his

495
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:16,719
talks about laid out which is the name

496
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:18,320
of the software on previous liberal

497
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:21,360
graphics meetings

498
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:23,520
um and uh we're getting to the end here

499
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:25,280
uh we say a lot of uh we talk a lot like

500
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,400
us designers talk a lot about how

501
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:28,000
developers should

502
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:30,160
integrate design thinking into their

503
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:33,200
processes and that's probably

504
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:34,320
why it's worth asking maybe it's also

505
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:37,360
worth thinking that maybe

506
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:40,159
us designers should humbly address

507
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:40,959
and integrate the principles and the

508
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:44,240
tools

509
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:47,679
and of free software and

510
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:49,840
open source another vision of the

511
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:51,280
two layers thing is the difference in

512
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:54,959
magazines and in the press

513
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:57,440
between free software publications

514
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:59,600
and design and art publications like

515
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,960
this is emigre and this is eye magazine

516
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,559
which you'll probably know if you come

517
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:05,679
from the design world

518
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:08,480
um so one of the things that we tried

519
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:10,000
a few for a few years was to actually

520
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:12,799
make a magazine that would sit

521
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,559
in between and would bridge these layers

522
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:15,039
it was called labor graphics magazine it

523
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:18,240
ended

524
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:19,440
a couple of years ago but we also last

525
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,919
year we finished

526
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:23,760
archiving and publishing all the

527
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:24,720
articles so that you can navigate them

528
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:27,919
in the browser you

529
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:30,000
before you could only do that in pdf

530
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:32,000
and also it was really important to show

531
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,320
that yeah it is possible to

532
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,600
work around these principles just use

533
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:37,439
free software to make a print

534
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:40,559
publication

535
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:42,320
and this archive this magazine was an

536
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:42,799
attempt to address this tension that we

537
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:45,678
are

538
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:46,160
presenting to you um today so it's about

539
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:48,160
leaving

540
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:50,000
our comfort zone we hear a lot about

541
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:52,000
designers who want to contribute but

542
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,360
i mean it's really tough to get get out

543
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,200
of adobe tools and

544
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:57,678
photoshop and of course sometimes you

545
00:19:55,200 --> 00:20:00,799
use that in your data up and transition

546
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:01,280
is a hard thing it took us more than a

547
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:03,760
year

548
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:05,039
to actually make the full switch 10

549
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:08,158
years ago

550
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:11,760
but it's really about getting out of the

551
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:13,919
comfort zone as a design principle

552
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:15,679
this switching the tools and this is

553
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:18,799
something that we're really keen on

554
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:20,080
is considering switching to free

555
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:22,480
software tools as

556
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:24,240
uh for your design process you start

557
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,880
looking at the tools in a very different

558
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,840
way

559
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:29,520
uh then you you start focusing on the

560
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,720
process we noticed when we taught

561
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:34,000
graphic design

562
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:35,840
and i'll be closing was to um

563
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,400
that we weren't talking about photoshop

564
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:39,840
anymore students

565
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:42,159
realized that they are not operating

566
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:44,320
photoshop they're doing bitmap images

567
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:46,240
which they can do with as well and

568
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,799
uh bugs bugs are really nice because

569
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,320
they

570
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:49,918
actually make you understand the

571
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:51,439
limitations of your own software and

572
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:52,640
once you realize the proprietary

573
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:55,440
software has the same

574
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:56,400
exactly the same problems things become

575
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:59,440
a lot

576
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:01,200
more clear to us so to end uh we tried

577
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,559
really an alternative to open source

578
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,520
design for all the reasons that we

579
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:06,480
showed we still

580
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:07,440
don't have it and we don't have that's

581
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:10,640
our sign

582
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:12,320
um but we think we really need to keep

583
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,360
asking the questions and presenting a

584
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:16,320
critique on that

585
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:16,959
not to be critical but to not lose sight

586
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,720
of

587
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,080
why we started this and where we are

588
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,760
going

589
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:24,000
we should leverage this uh the open

590
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:26,960
source design community was unthinkable

591
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,000
like 10 years ago designers talking

592
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:30,159
about free software and

593
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,919
willing to do that this was not a thing

594
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:32,799
at all and we should make the most out

595
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:35,760
of that

596
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:36,799
and this is kind of what the takeaway

597
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:39,120
from what we

598
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:40,080
were bringing here is really every br

599
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:42,399
and every

600
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:43,120
gap between design and development needs

601
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,960
to be

602
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:46,959
found first and then addressed and

603
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:49,440
hopefully erased so that

604
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:51,120
this ecosystem can actually and finally

605
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,640
work if you're interested in these

606
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,360
issues there's going to be an amazing

607
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,200
conference

608
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:56,719
not just a dev room but a whole

609
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:59,200
conference about

610
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:00,720
labor graphics which is in france in may

611
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:03,600
the call for talks is open

612
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,400
and maybe we'll see you there for now

613
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,918
we're done

614
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,679
and if you have any questions we'd be

615
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:13,840
more than happy to hear them

616
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:13,840
thank you

617
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,960
you
