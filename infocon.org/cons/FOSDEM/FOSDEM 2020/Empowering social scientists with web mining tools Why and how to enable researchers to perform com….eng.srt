1
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,679
okay hello everyone

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,559
so i'm really glad today to be uh in

3
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:12,160
this new room

4
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:13,678
which is all about open science and

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,839
tools and technologies

6
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,680
and so i'm here to speak about uh

7
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:18,640
empowering social scientists with web

8
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,160
mining tool

9
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:22,640
so we will see together what is web

10
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:25,359
mining and how we can like

11
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,279
teach researchers how to do so and uh

12
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:30,400
what tool we developed to help them

13
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:33,200
achieve like amazing tasks

14
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:36,640
so uh hello everyone i am guillaume

15
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:39,600
blick aka younger real on the internet

16
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:41,920
it's a youth mistake and so i am a

17
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,480
research engineer for a

18
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,160
research laboratory uh in french which

19
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,480
is called science pro media lab but i

20
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:52,640
will talk about that a bit more uh

21
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:53,199
later so uh what is web mining so who

22
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,239
here

23
00:00:53,199 --> 00:01:00,079
knows about web mining

24
00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:01,680
okay that's nice so then i will skip

25
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:03,359
so what is web mining just a reminder

26
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,360
for everyone so i will

27
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,360
only talk about web mining as a tool to

28
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,799
be able to like collect data from the

29
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,640
web and afterwards

30
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:12,479
how we are going to analyze this data

31
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,640
and like produce insights

32
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:16,640
from this data so basically on a

33
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,320
technical point of view web mining is

34
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,000
actually two or three things

35
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:22,559
the first thing the first thing being

36
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,280
scraping so what is scraping scraping is

37
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,759
the act of

38
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,640
retro engineering the html of a web page

39
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:29,759
to be able to

40
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,040
extract back the data that produces the

41
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,880
html page

42
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,320
so for instance here you have an example

43
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:37,119
which is a page from

44
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,479
the echo js website which is actually

45
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:40,799
accurate news for

46
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:41,759
javascript basically and so scraping

47
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,640
would be to like

48
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:46,720
open your inspector check how the html

49
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:50,240
has been written to display

50
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:51,840
this visual page and try to like extract

51
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,079
from the html

52
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,439
the data that we are interested in so

53
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:57,360
for instance here

54
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:59,600
it would be the title of the article

55
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,479
shared and the link to the article share

56
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,559
and so on

57
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:05,439
so this is the first thing scraping so

58
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:08,720
extracting data from web pages

59
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:09,359
using uh retro engineering and retro

60
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,800
engineering

61
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,800
and so on so scraping the second thing

62
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,000
web mining is is actually crawling so

63
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,920
crawling is a bit different

64
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,239
here we are going to design a bot or a

65
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:22,319
spider or a program which is going to

66
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:23,360
browse the web automatically and that

67
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:26,000
will like slowly

68
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,879
uh compose a network of pages of site

69
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,120
etc

70
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:30,799
and we are interesting in two things

71
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,040
what is the actual content

72
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:35,120
on those pages and what is the network

73
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:38,560
that's that is drawn by

74
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:40,640
like this whole navigation on the web

75
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,840
so scraping trolling and the third thing

76
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:45,359
is actually like

77
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,480
collecting data from apis so nowadays

78
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:50,239
for instance facebook

79
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:52,480
or twitter or linkedin share share

80
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:54,160
some data with you and so we can use and

81
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:56,238
leverage their apis

82
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:58,720
to be able to collect data and then gain

83
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:01,120
some insights

84
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:03,200
so uh this is it webmining here for the

85
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:06,480
purpose of the the talk will be scraping

86
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:09,440
crawling apis so the question is

87
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:11,440
why is this useful to social sciences

88
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:13,200
i'm putting social into brackets

89
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,480
because basically it could be useful to

90
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,359
any science i guess so

91
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:19,040
physics or chemistry also on but since i

92
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,800
am working for social scientists

93
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,079
i will speak from the point of view of

94
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,080
social sciences

95
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,200
so why is this useful to collect data on

96
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:28,080
the web

97
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,920
so the bad take on this is actually okay

98
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,519
every social sciences data collection is

99
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,319
biased if you do like for instance

100
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:35,440
questionnaires

101
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:37,760
or if you do interviews you have biased

102
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:39,280
data which is mostly due to what we call

103
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,959
the observers paradox

104
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,959
so when you ask people something they

105
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:43,840
will like be buyers because you are

106
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:45,440
asking them

107
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,760
the thing and you are in the room

108
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:49,359
observing them and so on

109
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,040
uh the thing which is really interesting

110
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,680
with internet is that people express

111
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,760
themselves

112
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,360
without being asked to so they are like

113
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,159
just going to express their opinion but

114
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,560
nobody is

115
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:59,519
observing i know lol because i'm

116
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,640
observing

117
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:04,319
right now and uh so it's less biased so

118
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:06,079
web mining would be

119
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:08,399
a superior source of data for social

120
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,680
sciences because it's not biased so this

121
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,519
is the bad take

122
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,920
the good take on this is that internet

123
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:15,519
data come with its own biases for

124
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,399
instance if you collect data on google

125
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:18,320
trends

126
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:19,440
of course you have like other biases

127
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,519
that you will find

128
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,840
and you should be aware of those biases

129
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:25,040
and so to be able to control and manage

130
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,960
those new biases

131
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,720
you have to apply media studies and

132
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,359
science and technology studies which is

133
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,440
a

134
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,400
a large field of social sciences which

135
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,800
study those those

136
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,840
issues and so the conclusion the good

137
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,240
take on this is that

138
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,198
web mining is still another very very

139
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,600
interesting and

140
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:42,560
very large data source so why not

141
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,880
collect it

142
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:47,120
we should collect it because it's just a

143
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:49,680
good thing and we can

144
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,360
so yeah the issue here is that web

145
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,759
mining is hard

146
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,479
okay to be able to perform web mining

147
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:56,800
tasks

148
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:59,039
to be able to scrape to crawl you need

149
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,960
to know the web and when i say the web i

150
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:04,000
i say the whole web so you need to know

151
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,799
how dns work http works hdm networks css

152
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,160
work js

153
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:10,560
the dom ajax ssr csr xpath and so on

154
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,240
you've got a lot of things to know and

155
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,880
learn about the web to be able to like

156
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:17,199
read through engineer it

157
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:19,039
so how do you teach researchers and for

158
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:22,639
instance social

159
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:24,560
social scientists those web technologies

160
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:26,080
so basically the same as everyone else

161
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:29,199
so you could like teach them

162
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:31,680
css and html and so on and uh

163
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:32,720
and try to like empower them through uh

164
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,800
the stitching

165
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,800
but what most consider as an easy layer

166
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,639
of technologies i don't know here but

167
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,240
there is a like a misconception in

168
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:42,320
technologies that says that

169
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,360
the web is actually really easy it's

170
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,880
really not

171
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,440
and we are really standing on the

172
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:49,680
shoulder of giants that someone here

173
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,800
has already tried to teach someone who

174
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,320
is like new to

175
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,080
the web technologies how the web

176
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:56,560
actually works

177
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:57,680
did someone do does this job okay

178
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,759
usually when you do that

179
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,919
you you remember like you notice that

180
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,479
you are standing on a huge mountain of

181
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:04,719
skills

182
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:07,120
which is actually really your daunting

183
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:10,400
so it's not really easy to teach people

184
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:12,960
about web technologies so

185
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,679
another question here is how to teach

186
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,599
researchers

187
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,120
how to scrape for instance so they know

188
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,639
about what technologies they know a bit

189
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,960
about javascript and python

190
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:22,400
so how can we empower them and teach

191
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,799
them how to scrape

192
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,239
and then you also have other issues

193
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,759
which are a bit different which has for

194
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,160
instance you are fighting the platforms

195
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:31,039
and their

196
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,840
apis platforms will try to like prevent

197
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:33,840
you from

198
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,520
applying scraping and crawling you've

199
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,039
got some legal issues in some countries

200
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,680
in some countries except for example

201
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:40,000
denmark

202
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,840
like teachers avoid teaching people

203
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,240
scraping because it's considered like a

204
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,359
lux

205
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,479
lock picking for instance it's

206
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:48,800
considered a bit illegal or gray

207
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:50,560
and you have to wiggle when you publish

208
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,000
something using scraping because

209
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,000
sometimes you have to say oh no i did

210
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,240
not scribe i had a monkey army clicking

211
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,479
on the button really fast

212
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,240
so you have a lot of hoops to jump

213
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:02,159
through

214
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,360
and what's more and this is something i

215
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:06,560
really want to stress today

216
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:08,720
is that uh jupiterizing uh researchers

217
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,319
is not a solution sometimes we say okay

218
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,280
we are going to empower researchers we

219
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,319
are going to teach them

220
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,559
everything they need to know they are

221
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:15,919
going to learn python to fighter

222
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,759
web technologies and they are going to

223
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:19,758
scrape by themselves

224
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,120
this is a really good solution but it's

225
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:23,360
not really appliable

226
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:25,039
to the real world so for instance and

227
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,800
what's more in social sciences some

228
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:27,199
researchers don't have the time no the

229
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,919
will

230
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:30,319
to learn all those skills and we should

231
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:32,000
be

232
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:33,520
okay as a community we should be okay

233
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,400
with that it's okay

234
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:37,039
researchers don't have to to learn the

235
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,880
skills

236
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:40,719
and the question then is how are we

237
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:44,240
going to empower them

238
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,639
all the same and what's more and this is

239
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,400
some

240
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,759
the second point again against the

241
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,758
jupiterization of um

242
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,879
researchers is that web mining is

243
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,440
actually really

244
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:55,360
really really hard it's really a

245
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,160
craftsmanship basically where mining is

246
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,879
a job

247
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:01,680
it's not a skill so internet for

248
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:04,720
instance is a dirty dirty dirty place

249
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:06,879
so you've got conventions basically so

250
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:09,840
you are supposed to code a website like

251
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:10,879
correctly uh cleanly but basically

252
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:13,599
everything is

253
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:14,000
really badly implemented and so brothers

254
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:15,759
to

255
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,199
today are really like heuristical

256
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:19,199
wonders they have a lot of

257
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:21,199
routines and programs to make sure that

258
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:23,120
the the webpage that you send

259
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:24,560
which is really messy will be read by

260
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,759
the browser correctly

261
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:31,759
so you you have to know all of those

262
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:33,519
things when you want to to do web mining

263
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:34,959
what's more you need to know about like

264
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:35,599
things which are kind of considered

265
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:38,478
advanced

266
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:39,519
in informatics which is for instance how

267
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:41,360
to multi-thread

268
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,880
a program how to parallelize things how

269
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,440
to throttle your ap

270
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,959
http request and if you don't know how

271
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,560
to do that you will harm

272
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:50,399
actual people for instance at the

273
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,640
beginning of our journey we did not know

274
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:55,360
how to throttle http request

275
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:56,640
so we basically cut all our university's

276
00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:01,519
access to google

277
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:03,839
which is a bit problematic not too much

278
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:05,120
and you need to know all about those

279
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:07,279
kind of stuff which are really

280
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:09,440
complicated if you want to be able to

281
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:10,800
actually perform web mining you need to

282
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,959
know a lot of skills

283
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:15,120
so what i mean here is that it really is

284
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:19,040
a craftsmanship it really is a

285
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:23,040
job and you can't expect people to be

286
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:24,959
researchers and web miners

287
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:27,680
so the question then is how are we going

288
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:30,319
to empower researchers all the same

289
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,800
and the answer here is by designing

290
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,800
tools

291
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,399
suited to their research question so we

292
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:37,760
need to have designers

293
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:41,920
who is a designer in this room him

294
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:41,920
yeah so we need more designers

295
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,080
and so how did we do that so i worked

296
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,959
for a laboratory which is called sanspo

297
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,519
media lab

298
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:50,160
and the seminal idea of the lab was to

299
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:52,399
like gather

300
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,360
three kind of people so social science

301
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:56,399
researchers

302
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:58,800
uh designers such as this guy and

303
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:00,160
engineers such as me and so we're going

304
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,920
to like mix those people

305
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:04,560
and we are going to design tools which

306
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:09,599
are suited to the researchers

307
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:09,599
questions and work this is basically it

308
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:16,079
so what i propose here is to uh

309
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:17,200
to guide you through some of the tools

310
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:19,519
we designed

311
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,399
to be able to like empower really

312
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,800
empower

313
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:24,320
social scientists to perform web mining

314
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,640
tasks

315
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,760
and so the first one we did was called

316
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:31,040
r2.js

317
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:33,600
so it's a bad pun on r2d2

318
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:35,279
and the idea here is um was uh was

319
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,040
beginning from the the following thing

320
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:38,959
if you know about like modern web

321
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:41,839
technologies you will uh

322
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:42,560
you will fastly encounter something

323
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:44,480
which is called like

324
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:46,160
uh dynamic rendering which means that

325
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,640
the the page is not rendered on the

326
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,319
server

327
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,439
it's rendered on the client using

328
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,320
javascript and so on it's really

329
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,720
complicated

330
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:54,560
and if you want to emulate them emulate

331
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,519
this to be able to scrape it's kind of

332
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:58,399
difficult

333
00:10:55,519 --> 00:11:00,000
so the idea was to actually parasite the

334
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:03,360
web browser to perform some web

335
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,720
mining tasks but i know it's a bit

336
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,440
abstract so i'm going to

337
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,920
try a small demo time so everything will

338
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,279
break

339
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:12,560
now this is how it works so for instance

340
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:13,120
let's say you have a researcher who

341
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:16,000
wants to

342
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,720
scrape this webpage get the whole list

343
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,360
as a csv

344
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:21,440
table so you're going to go to the page

345
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:25,200
and then you are going to inject

346
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:26,959
some parasite code to help you like

347
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,480
scrape the data and provide the

348
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:30,640
researcher with the data

349
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,519
so i use a bookmarklet which is called

350
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,680
r2

351
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:35,279
which is loaded directly into the

352
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:38,239
webpage context

353
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:40,560
and r2 is going to help me to do some

354
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,560
stuff

355
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,600
fast

356
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:48,240
it can do some sound which is its most

357
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:50,639
interesting feature

358
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,680
then i will be able to use like

359
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:57,200
something like uh

360
00:11:51,680 --> 00:12:00,560
all the old-school jquery

361
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:01,360
and using like css stuff very basic

362
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:04,079
stuff

363
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,560
i will be able to scrape data so here

364
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:07,120
i'm just

365
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:08,719
attempting to like scrape the data from

366
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:11,120
the website but directly

367
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,839
within the web pages uh javascript

368
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,959
context

369
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:18,399
and when i have that i'm also able

370
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:25,839
to help the researchers

371
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:25,839
by doing this thing

372
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:31,440
yes it doesn't work because i don't

373
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,439
know

374
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:39,839
sorry it's a bad life cutting situation

375
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:55,680
yeah yeah

376
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:57,519
yeah and so now i have like the the data

377
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:59,599
that does not work

378
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:01,760
so basically i've scripted the thing as

379
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,800
a csv file and i'm now able to provide

380
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,319
it to the researchers

381
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:06,160
the main point here is that it's still

382
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:08,639
code but the fact is you can like

383
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:10,480
use this same code to generate uh

384
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:12,480
bookmarklets custom bookmarklets

385
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,399
for the the researchers so i it means

386
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,160
that i will go to this kind of interface

387
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:17,600
i will paste my code here and then i

388
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:19,360
will create something which is actually

389
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,000
a bookmark for the researchers you just

390
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,560
have to copy

391
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
it on its web browser and then it will

392
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,839
only go to this page

393
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,440
click on the button and it will download

394
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:29,440
the csv form and so

395
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,639
uh for this kind of scenario we have

396
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,399
researchers that like

397
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:34,399
do some really qualitative search on

398
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:36,639
website and just want to like

399
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:37,760
pick some list and aggregate them and so

400
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:41,199
we use this tool

401
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:45,360
r2.js to provide them with this kind of

402
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:45,359
like haddock and tailored bookmarklets

403
00:13:45,519 --> 00:14:03,839
so this is the first thing r2.js

404
00:13:49,040 --> 00:14:06,480
the question here is that can we

405
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:07,680
which is a bit more hefty so we created

406
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:11,920
something which is called now

407
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:14,160
mynet and what is the goal of minot

408
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:15,920
so the goal of my net is actually to

409
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:17,279
provide you with some common line tools

410
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:19,279
which is going to like handle

411
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:21,439
all the pesky details of web mining for

412
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:22,399
you so basically all the things which

413
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,760
are in bold

414
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:25,519
are the thing on which you are going to

415
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:27,439
focus and work

416
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:29,440
actually work all the thing which is

417
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,959
around is the thing i handle for you so

418
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,800
you don't have to

419
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:34,560
so multi-threading multi-processing and

420
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,880
and so on i will do that for you

421
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:38,479
you you just focus on the fact which is

422
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:40,480
i want to get for instance one million

423
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:42,800
page from the web and then extract

424
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,760
the actual content and data for uh for

425
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,959
it

426
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,959
do we have time for a demo

427
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:52,240
no maybe so so basically mynet is a cli

428
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:54,880
tool

429
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:56,079
it's a unix tool which like complied to

430
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:58,959
the unix philosophy

431
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:59,839
so it does one thing only one thing well

432
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:02,560
and this thing is

433
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:03,680
web mining which is a big hefty thing

434
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:06,079
but it does it well

435
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:08,479
and you can like pipe commons and so on

436
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:10,719
and it looks like

437
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:12,240
that for instance so basically you are

438
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,880
going to use the common line tune to be

439
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,800
able to

440
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:16,480
for instance fetch a lot of pages from

441
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:19,519
the web then scrape

442
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:20,399
massively and in a parallel parallelize

443
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:22,560
the fashion

444
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:23,440
from a lot of web pages you could also

445
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,119
extract

446
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,560
raw content from articles so you can do

447
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,959
like nlp stuff on it

448
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:29,839
afterwards and so on so it's a really uh

449
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:32,399
it's it's a

450
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:33,120
swiss army for web mining which is a

451
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:35,519
scalable

452
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:37,600
and which is a lo-fi it doesn't run on

453
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:39,920
any database it works on csv file

454
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,279
it pipes to the std out and on the pipes

455
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:44,479
and it's really like

456
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:46,240
yeah lo-fi uh

457
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,759
and what's more uh the thing which is

458
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,160
really important for us and which is

459
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:50,240
like

460
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:51,920
true for r2 and minute is that it's

461
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,839
relocalized data collection on the

462
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:55,599
researchers computers themselves

463
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:57,040
sometimes you need a service

464
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,480
but sometimes you don't and it's

465
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,680
important for the researchers to be able

466
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:02,800
to like control

467
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:03,680
uh his or her data but by being able to

468
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:07,120
do this stuff

469
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:08,880
on his or her computer so they are like

470
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,880
really in in control

471
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,959
and basically in social sciences we

472
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:15,279
rarely do what we call like big data

473
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:17,119
tm we don't do this stuff everything

474
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:20,079
stands and is able to fit in

475
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,079
a single computer

476
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,920
and what's more if you really want to do

477
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,079
some jupiter stuff

478
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:27,920
and that's all right uh you have a

479
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:29,680
programmatic api which hides all the

480
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,399
complexity for you so if you want to do

481
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,239
something like

482
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:33,680
okay i want to fetch 1 million pages

483
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,560
from the internet and i want to do it

484
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,959
right

485
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:38,719
you can just do a simple for loop and

486
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:40,880
you will have all this stuff handled for

487
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,880
you

488
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:46,000
and so then we have seen like how to

489
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:48,239
enable researcher to scrape

490
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,920
to collect data from apis and so the

491
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,600
question is what's the next step can we

492
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:53,839
design something which is a bit more

493
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:55,040
ambitious something which is more like a

494
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:57,759
gui

495
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:58,800
and we actually can so for instance in

496
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:00,959
the lab we are

497
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:02,160
developing a tool which is called hive

498
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:03,920
which is a web crawler

499
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:06,000
which has a dedicated interface which

500
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:08,399
enables researchers to like

501
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,079
crawl the web crawl a subset of the web

502
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,839
and be able like to make sense of it

503
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:14,240
without having any kind of

504
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:15,760
technical and technical knowledge so how

505
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,799
do we enable researchers to crawl the

506
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:20,160
web

507
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:21,520
using this tool so hive it looks like

508
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,240
that for instance so you have an

509
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,480
interface

510
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,760
everything is like you push button and

511
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,039
you input things

512
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,480
using the keyboard you don't have to

513
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:29,440
know how to code you don't have to know

514
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,520
how to program

515
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,880
and you are still able to like crawl

516
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:35,360
millions of webpage

517
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,080
and be able to like construct build a

518
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:38,080
corpus

519
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,840
which is a subset of the web on which

520
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:42,320
you are actually

521
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,320
working on

522
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:47,600
and so finally we use this design we use

523
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:49,840
designers actual designers

524
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:51,439
to be able to serve a robust methodology

525
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:54,080
which has been proven to work on

526
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:55,039
mainly like social sociological and

527
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:57,280
works

528
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:58,400
and we like we designed the tool to be

529
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:01,840
able to represent

530
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,840
this kind of methodology

531
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:06,080
and what's more i just want to emphasize

532
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:08,239
uh

533
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:10,240
last time that it's really non-trivial

534
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:12,080
uh some people have already tried to

535
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:14,799
like build a crawler and crawl the web

536
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,600
using a spider here to build and program

537
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:19,520
the spider

538
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:21,360
is this really easy no so you have to

539
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:23,679
make some things and like for instance

540
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,000
on this particular interface we had to

541
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:26,480
like

542
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,760
build our own indexing database to be

543
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,960
able to like index

544
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:33,600
multi-layered graft and we have a a talk

545
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:35,520
which was given here like two years ago

546
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,199
if you want to check and it was it was

547
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:39,440
yeah it's called the trough basically

548
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:42,720
that's the job

549
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:45,360
yeah so uh as a conclusion uh my

550
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,080
main point here is that researchers

551
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,479
should not be

552
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:49,120
expected to like learn uh all the ins

553
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,039
and outs of

554
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:52,879
web mining and programming and so there

555
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:53,760
is always a trade-off when you design

556
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,520
tools for them

557
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,960
suited to their needs between

558
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:59,280
scalability so how much

559
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:01,760
data they can handle and fetch and

560
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,960
usability so how easy is it to use the

561
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:05,200
tool and to

562
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:06,160
to do this kind of stuff so we need to

563
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,480
be able to design

564
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:10,080
a user path and to do so we need to be

565
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:12,559
able to take a step back on what we are

566
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:16,080
doing and take the time to like abstract

567
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:18,960
or design a path and i hope that's

568
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:20,399
what we are doing right now so what's

569
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:23,440
the future

570
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:25,919
we would like to do a gui for mynet so

571
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,640
the researchers are able to like use it

572
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:29,200
without

573
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,400
needing to learn the unix command line

574
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,640
and so if anyone is

575
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,440
up for it we need we need people we are

576
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:37,840
recruiting

577
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:46,450
also and thank you for listening

578
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:46,449
[Applause]

579
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:53,840
yes

580
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:05,280
i will say to you officially that i do

581
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:07,840
but

582
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,840
i do not

583
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:11,919
know basically it's for us it's not an

584
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,360
ethical question it's more of a

585
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,840
technical question because it's really

586
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:16,399
heavy

587
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:17,760
for us to like fetch the thing and we

588
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:20,880
don't know how to do that

589
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:23,520
very well so we don't but we could

590
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,520
we could do it

591
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:29,600
yes we use crepey on the hive for

592
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,840
instance

593
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:33,039
so they but i think the version we use

594
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:49,840
does not respect the

595
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:49,840
that tasty yes

596
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:57,039
yeah we try to use those tools with

597
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,320
researchers a lot so those are basically

598
00:20:57,039 --> 00:21:00,240
tools that um

599
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:02,240
scrape automatically by learning what

600
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:04,320
you are trying to extract

601
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:06,400
it did not very it did not work very

602
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:08,559
very well we also tried to design our

603
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,440
own tools but failed uh miserably

604
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:11,760
basically

605
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:13,360
uh and uh it's something we we are still

606
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:16,240
interested in but we haven't found

607
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:16,719
the the thing which really works yet

608
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,440
with

609
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,440
our researchers

610
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:26,240
yes something about the kind of social

611
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:28,000
kind of questions that the social

612
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,559
researchers were attacking with these

613
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,240
tools

614
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:31,918
yeah sure for instance right now we're

615
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:34,960
working

616
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:36,159
what yeah so the question is uh is there

617
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:40,000
an example of a

618
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:42,240
like actual research project or a

619
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,120
question we are actually using web

620
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,960
mining for

621
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:46,479
and so uh currently we are working on a

622
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:48,960
project which is uh

623
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,679
which aims at uh studying how people in

624
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:52,559
france

625
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:54,400
share and read medias and so we are

626
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:56,840
using web mining in a multiple of

627
00:21:54,400 --> 00:22:00,159
fashions for instance we collect all the

628
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:01,600
articles text from 400 medias

629
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:04,000
we collect all the tweets mentioning

630
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:05,678
those urls we collect all the facebook

631
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:09,440
posts mentioning those urls

632
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:11,200
and many more so youtube videos

633
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:12,720
from those media outlets and so on so we

634
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,960
collect a really large

635
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,840
amount of data to be able to see whether

636
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,919
like

637
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:21,039
media's polarized around political

638
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:21,039
questions or not etc

639
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,840
yes

640
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:43,039
okay so for for facebook there is a

641
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,840
trick which is actually uh interesting

642
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:46,480
which is that

643
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:48,240
they still need to serve a mob a mobile

644
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,720
application which is heavily used in

645
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,520
india

646
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,159
and in india uh like they can't restrict

647
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:55,039
it because

648
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:56,320
else you will like block users so you

649
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:59,039
can like hit on it

650
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:59,840
like a madman and it still works it's

651
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:01,360
not really a good

652
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:03,439
it's a good option but the fact is they

653
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:05,039
won't serve you like they actual data

654
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,919
sometimes you have like relative dates

655
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:08,080
and you need to

656
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:09,280
parse those relative dates to be able to

657
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,720
find things but it's

658
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:12,879
usually a good solution to be able to

659
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:15,120
scrape massively facebook for instance

660
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:16,880
so we found workarounds and if we don't

661
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:18,799
find workarounds we use like a proxy

662
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:23,840
meshes which are able to like hit

663
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:23,840
from multiple angles fastly

664
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:30,479
uh not yet it will soon because we need

665
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:33,840
to

666
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,840
but if you want you can help us

667
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:38,080
any other question

668
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:51,840
thank you thanks
