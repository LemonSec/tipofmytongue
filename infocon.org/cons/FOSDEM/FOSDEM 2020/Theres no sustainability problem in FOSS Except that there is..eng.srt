1
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:08,240
let me introduce you sure

2
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:09,840
uh this is joanne o'brien he works at

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,480
indeed in the open source programs

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,639
office

5
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:13,759
and we're here today to talk to you

6
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:16,160
about uh see

7
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:17,760
how it looks bad uh there's no

8
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:20,800
sustainability problem in

9
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:23,920
foss except that there is

10
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:26,080
uh so we actually there the name

11
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,199
uh the title sustainability is actually

12
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:29,278
in our

13
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:30,320
slide and so we actually wanted to see

14
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:33,680
if we could get

15
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:36,320
some ideas about things that have been

16
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:38,239
called sustainability problems recently

17
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,200
uh we have

18
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:41,440
is there any way we can get it to

19
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:44,879
present on

20
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:47,360
well no it just it's off the screen

21
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:49,839
oh i'm sorry it's okay that's off the

22
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,519
screen yeah

23
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,840
interesting okay share with us one

24
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,840
moment

25
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,680
yeah it was fine when we

26
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:03,920
let's just take it out of presenter mode

27
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,920
okay

28
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:08,559
sorry guys just one sec it's actually

29
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,400
kind of hard to see

30
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:13,840
yeah i can't actually see where this is

31
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,840
there we are

32
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,520
technology just press present and i

33
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:23,680
think it'll

34
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:25,280
auto scale yes that looks so much better

35
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,280
okay thank you i'm glad we took that

36
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,799
second uh so

37
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,799
uh we wanted to talk about things that

38
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:31,280
have been called sustainability problems

39
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:34,000
in

40
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,600
in our ecosystem so we highlighted some

41
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,040
some news articles here that we've seen

42
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,839
blog posts

43
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:41,600
this open source and sustainability blog

44
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,759
post from the open source initiative

45
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,439
is published in 2008 if you can't see

46
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:46,799
that so people have been having this

47
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:49,279
conversation for

48
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,560
quite a long time and in quite a lot of

49
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:54,720
different ways in a lot of

50
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:56,799
different contexts so

51
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,320
have people are people familiar with the

52
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:59,600
sustainability com

53
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,679
conversation have you heard it come up

54
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,798
in news have you read articles have you

55
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,320
had conversations with other people

56
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:06,719
about sustainability can i see

57
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,758
just approximate hands all right so

58
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:09,919
quite a few people

59
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:11,760
anybody want to hazard a guess or hazard

60
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:13,839
their own definition for

61
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,519
what that means like what does it mean

62
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,239
when you are talking to someone about

63
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:23,840
sustainability

64
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:23,840
we're friendly it's an interactive

65
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,640
consistent availability of participant

66
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:32,160
time who has a completely different

67
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:32,160
definition of sustainability than that

68
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:37,518
right there money all right so it's not

69
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,800
about time it's about money who has

70
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:40,800
something that isn't time or money

71
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:53,518
ability to remain consistent it sounds

72
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:56,800
like okay

73
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:59,440
okay a third fourth fifth devin's a

74
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,440
cheater but yeah

75
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,000
um

76
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,840
ongoing development but it also might be

77
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,760
a project done okay

78
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,920
okay so ability to depend on our

79
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,640
infrastructure maybe it's done or maybe

80
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,799
it's not

81
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,799
right

82
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:22,640
so okay

83
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:23,280
oh this isn't even plugged in here so as

84
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,040
you can see

85
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,480
uh from from all the different answers

86
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,440
in the room there's no one consistent

87
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,159
definition

88
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:31,760
uh there's no one consistent way people

89
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:33,599
are talking about it and there's no

90
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,840
shared understanding

91
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:37,200
however there are lots of conversations

92
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,400
happening around sustainability and

93
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,798
there's lots of programs that are meant

94
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,959
to address sustainability problems

95
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:43,840
and we would even go so far as to say

96
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,080
this is actually

97
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,760
diminishing the problem because there is

98
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,480
no consistent definition and because

99
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,798
we're

100
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,720
often trying to apply one hammer to a

101
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:54,159
bunch of different kinds of nails

102
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,439
we're ending up in a situation where

103
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:56,480
we're calling a lot of different things

104
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:58,720
sustainability

105
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,560
and it's actually unhelpful to to the

106
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,720
conversation entirely

107
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,080
there's also no one particular solution

108
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,519
there might be different solutions to

109
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,640
different kinds of sustainability

110
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:07,920
problems and depending on your

111
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:11,359
understanding and depending on

112
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,359
the remedies that might be appropriate

113
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:18,239
so the the previous talk queued up uh

114
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:20,959
uh some events or issues that

115
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:22,479
have come up in recent years there's a

116
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:24,000
chance that they will come up in every

117
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:27,039
talk so they're gonna come

118
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,400
up in ours too um it's this one i'm

119
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,880
going to close this

120
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:32,400
all right so uh we'll talk a little bit

121
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,440
about heart street uh heartbleed we're

122
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,159
going to talk a bit a little bit about

123
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,120
left pad

124
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,120
where we're going to talk a little bit

125
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,080
about event stream as well and i'm going

126
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,199
to give

127
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:43,840
a super redacted uh version of the

128
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:46,000
events for each one of these

129
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,280
and we'll take a look at are they are

130
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,960
they sustainability

131
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,159
problems are they problems or are they

132
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,520
issues that came up because of

133
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,080
sustainability

134
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:55,758
uh or are they something else i also

135
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:58,880
wanted to point out on this slide just

136
00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:01,520
some of some of the headlines on how

137
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:03,360
exclamatory they are one programmer

138
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:05,039
almost broke the internet by deleting 11

139
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,440
lines of code

140
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:08,400
hacker backdoors popular javascript

141
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,199
library

142
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,919
what heartbleed taught the tech world uh

143
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:13,520
the entire

144
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:15,120
world has apparently uh learned from

145
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:17,599
heartbleed or maybe not

146
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,880
uh so uh obviously not only is this

147
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,000
conversation happening there's a lot of

148
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,520
different kinds of conversations

149
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,400
happening about sustainability

150
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,198
but people are scared people are are

151
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,120
fearful

152
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:30,560
and i think that's also coloring we also

153
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,560
think that's coloring the debate as well

154
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:36,160
all right so the shortest possible

155
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,120
version of events that i can give for

156
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,479
left pad

157
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:42,160
as a developer got angry they deleted

158
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:43,599
their projects from npm

159
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,600
and the internet breaks now that was the

160
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,880
headline we saw in the previous article

161
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,720
and it was actually the way it was

162
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,479
categorized in the previous talk as well

163
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,479
the entire internet broke when

164
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:54,159
when left pad was taken down well that's

165
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:57,280
a little dramatic the entire internet

166
00:05:54,160 --> 00:06:00,000
didn't break um but this was

167
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:01,840
the shortest possible versions of events

168
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,039
and the nature of the actual

169
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:06,239
disagreement

170
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:08,240
uh came about because there was a tr

171
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,000
a conflict about the name space that the

172
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,039
developer was using and npm had to

173
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,639
decide on the

174
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:14,400
on the uh come down on the side of the

175
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:18,479
trademark holder so

176
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:21,120
um is this a sustainability problem

177
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:22,560
yeah so uh this actually was a dispute

178
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,160
about an entirely different package than

179
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,720
left pad the developer actually ended up

180
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,120
taking

181
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,919
taking down all of his published npm

182
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,880
packages

183
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:31,680
after after this dispute but it ended up

184
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,159
being the case

185
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,919
uh we all found out in hindsight that

186
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,919
hundreds thousands tens of thousands

187
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:40,960
millions of people had depended on these

188
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:41,680
on these 11 lines of code and so when he

189
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,680
took down these

190
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,199
these packages and a huff all the people

191
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,720
who depended on it or maybe didn't even

192
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:48,319
know they were depending on it

193
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,960
uh ended up in a in a difficult

194
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:51,759
situation is this a sustainability

195
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:55,039
problem

196
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:56,800
uh so a lot of enterprises a lot of

197
00:06:55,039 --> 00:07:00,560
really big companies were affected

198
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:03,520
by the left pad events and

199
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,919
a lot a lot of companies were very upset

200
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,000
that

201
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:07,440
someone would take down an npm they were

202
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,280
depending on and

203
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,960
um first of all could they have written

204
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:13,440
those 11 lines of codes themselves if it

205
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:16,479
was so crucial to their infrastructure

206
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:18,800
and if we had applied more more money

207
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:20,000
more time more developers more resources

208
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,759
to left pad

209
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,680
would that have actually solved the

210
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:25,520
problem would that have prevented

211
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,120
people from having taken the dependency

212
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,080
on the thing and then having it

213
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,440
unpublished now he would have

214
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,440
unpublished it no matter

215
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,719
it's i i would i would pause it he would

216
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,400
have unpublished it

217
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,919
no matter how much time money energy

218
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:38,479
resources he probably

219
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:41,280
wouldn't have if npm had sided with him

220
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:42,639
but that's not a sustainability problem

221
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,559
and it probably likely has a different

222
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:45,919
solution than

223
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,759
than the other ones we're going to talk

224
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,479
about uh oh sorry yeah business

225
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,720
responsibility

226
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:52,080
so uh like i said was saying enterprises

227
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,160
are all dependent on

228
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:56,240
left pad if you're an enterprise that's

229
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,840
dependent on 11 lines of code that if

230
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,280
it's taken down will take down your

231
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,039
infrastructure

232
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,719
who's whose fault is that who's pro

233
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:04,719
problem is that i i would go so far as

234
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:07,360
to say you made a poor business decision

235
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,800
far far far before that left pad package

236
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,800
came down

237
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:13,440
that maybe maybe you're kicking yourself

238
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:17,199
about maybe you're quite upset that

239
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:17,199
that package actually ended up

240
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:21,198
causing some kind of problem to your

241
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:23,199
infrastructure depending on the urgency

242
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:24,319
but even still why were you depending on

243
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:25,360
it if it was so crucial to your

244
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:28,000
infrastructure

245
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:29,280
why didn't you have uh remedy potential

246
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,960
remedies and

247
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,478
fail safes for for those things being

248
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,000
taken down in the first place that's not

249
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:35,839
that's not the open source communities

250
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,640
problem to fix that that is a business

251
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:39,200
decision

252
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:40,958
uh business risk uh analysis you needed

253
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,200
to make

254
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:45,119
so the good news is that clearly we

255
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,640
learned something from left pad because

256
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:50,240
later on we had event stream

257
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:51,519
right um and i i i

258
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,120
you know i'm being maybe a little

259
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:55,440
facetious there but i do actually mean

260
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,440
it we did learn something from left pad

261
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,200
and that is demonstrated by event stream

262
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,640
so the shortest possible events

263
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,959
uh version of events is there was a

264
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:04,319
stable node module the maintainer was no

265
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:06,000
longer interested in it

266
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,600
a stranger showed up and offered to take

267
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,320
over the project and the maintainer said

268
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,839
yes

269
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,519
uh and then the stranger used the

270
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:13,279
project for malicious purposes now the

271
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:13,680
reason i say that we learned from left

272
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:16,000
pad

273
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:17,599
and and we can see that in event stream

274
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,200
is that for the most part

275
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,200
this didn't break the internet that

276
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,880
wasn't the headline right it was there

277
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,360
were you know check your repos there

278
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:26,399
might be

279
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:28,880
sneaky crypto uh stealing code in there

280
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,760
uh so that's an improvement it's still a

281
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:32,480
sensational

282
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,959
set of headlines uh but i will once

283
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:37,839
again

284
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:37,839
is this a sustainability problem

285
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,279
uh so this this i would say is a

286
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,839
divested

287
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:44,320
responsibility problem which is um if

288
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:46,000
there

289
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,080
are vulnerabilities if there are

290
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,959
problems in in other packages

291
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:52,240
you need you have a responsibility in in

292
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:55,839
depending on them

293
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,959
to uh to apply responsibility

294
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:59,200
appropriately here

295
00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:01,599
again this is a question of would more

296
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,000
time more money more developers applied

297
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,160
to

298
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,880
this particular situation have actually

299
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:09,760
solved the problem

300
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:10,560
well there's another aspect of this that

301
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,720
is

302
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:15,920
you know this was a this is a poor

303
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:18,160
judgment on the maintainers part and his

304
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,199
i i had a personal issue with some of

305
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,279
the response

306
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,800
from the maintainer because they're they

307
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:24,000
they took the position that they weren't

308
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,959
getting paid for it and what do you

309
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,720
expect and and

310
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:28,640
seem to not feel like they have bore any

311
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:31,839
sense of responsibility for it

312
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:33,360
um so maybe not a a good judgment on

313
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:36,880
their part

314
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:39,839
but let's entertain for a moment

315
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:41,120
the idea that had this been done by a

316
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:43,360
well-supported

317
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,240
well-maintained well-supported

318
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,760
well-financed

319
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,519
very healthy work life balance

320
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,640
maintainer had they just decided one day

321
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:51,120
that they wanted to

322
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,720
put crypto mining code into all of their

323
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,079
javascript dependencies

324
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,320
nothing about this would have been

325
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:58,079
prevented right

326
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,640
so there's nothing about sustainability

327
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:03,760
that created that particular problem

328
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:07,199
right uh and the only thing really

329
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:09,120
preventing a good actor uh from

330
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,320
uh changing into a bad actor and doing

331
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,880
this we're just kind of taking this on

332
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,959
faith

333
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:14,560
right so not really a sustainability

334
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:15,279
problem maybe maybe some judgment but

335
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,199
not a thing that would have been

336
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:18,480
prevented by pouring more money or time

337
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:23,120
in into the

338
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:23,120
into the project okay

339
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:28,640
and and heartbleed uh and i

340
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,920
i was probably kinder to this one it is

341
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:32,319
a white there was a widely

342
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:33,360
uh used library it had an undiscovered

343
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,040
vulnerability

344
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,480
one that had been there for over two

345
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:39,760
years uh

346
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:43,360
and the discovery of it uh and um

347
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:46,000
awareness around it created a huge

348
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:47,600
huge initiative to drive hundreds of

349
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,200
thousands of updates onto public web

350
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,880
servers it was kind of a big deal

351
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:53,360
and in the process of doing this of

352
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,399
course the projects gets heavily

353
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,320
scrutinized

354
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:58,560
we recognize that it is maintained as a

355
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,600
limited volunteer effort famously uh two

356
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,359
guys named steve

357
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,360
right uh responsible for securing the

358
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,920
internet as as a headline that was going

359
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,560
around

360
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:08,319
was heartbleed a sustainability problem

361
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:10,160
so i would actually say that

362
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,839
of the other three cases that we've

363
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:14,880
presented this is likely

364
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:17,279
the most uh the the one i would most

365
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:18,639
uh want to call a sustainability problem

366
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:21,120
because it highlights our

367
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:21,920
interdependency on each other and the

368
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,000
fact that

369
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:26,479
one vulnerability introduced into the

370
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,800
system is it can actually affect all of

371
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:30,160
us

372
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:32,079
and and that even if we take um good

373
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:34,079
good remediation good caution around

374
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:35,680
those things that we we can still be

375
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:37,279
subject to these things and in fact

376
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:39,120
we're living we're living in

377
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:41,120
the fosse ecosystem in in a world in

378
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,639
which one thing can affect can affect

379
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:46,480
many many many of us

380
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:48,160
um and and in this case um

381
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,839
as as dwayne said this was a

382
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,040
vulnerability that had been in in this

383
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:53,519
for two years

384
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,880
and if there had been more security

385
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:56,000
research applied to this maybe it would

386
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:58,800
have found maybe not

387
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,560
uh but there there could have been time

388
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,680
and potentially developer resources

389
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,760
applied to this

390
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:05,040
and and potentially it might it might

391
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:08,160
have been mitigated if not

392
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:09,680
if not avoided entirely but this is a

393
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,959
much different problem than the other

394
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:13,040
two that we've mentioned

395
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:14,319
and a potential solution would look much

396
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,319
different to this

397
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:18,639
uh than it would to to the previous two

398
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,639
as well

399
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:23,519
i think we're just on the next one yeah

400
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:25,920
okay so um

401
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:28,079
there there isn't one there isn't a

402
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:31,040
sustainability problem in foss there

403
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:32,638
are many right there are dozens of

404
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,399
different categories of problems that

405
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:36,160
may be related to sustainability

406
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:37,839
and there are other issues in the

407
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,959
ecosystem that have nothing to do with

408
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:41,199
sustainability

409
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:42,399
that often get thrown in into that same

410
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:44,000
um bucket

411
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:45,760
uh i remember the thought that i was

412
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,800
going to raise about interdependency

413
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:49,680
uh one of the problems uh that we

414
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,199
encounter

415
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:53,279
uh as people who work in open source

416
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:55,920
program offices uh

417
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:57,920
is the problem of trying to balance the

418
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:01,680
signal-to-noise ratio so

419
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:02,000
here's what i mean i have a compliance

420
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,680
tool

421
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,560
that one runs on a regular basis it

422
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:08,079
tells us in addition to the license

423
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,760
obligations that we have the kinds of

424
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:11,680
things that we are using there are

425
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:13,839
thousands and thousands of direct

426
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:16,160
dependencies in this list

427
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:17,680
which of them should i help which of

428
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,519
them need help

429
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,959
which of the updates are most important

430
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:23,519
for us to be paying attention to there's

431
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:24,959
a tremendous amount of information there

432
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:27,199
and i think funding is a really

433
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:28,239
interesting um thing to talk about for

434
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:30,959
the person who

435
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:32,560
who raised it as money right um there

436
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:34,319
are thousands and thousands of

437
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,599
dependencies in this list

438
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,240
do i give all of them ten thousand

439
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:40,000
dollars like that's very quickly cost

440
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,519
prohibitive and i know for a fact that

441
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,680
many of them don't want that

442
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:45,279
some of them might want five from coffee

443
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:48,560
right um

444
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:50,880
so uh trying to figure out uh

445
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:52,079
in this vast sea of information like

446
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,600
which projects want

447
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:55,359
what kind of help and need what kind of

448
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,360
help is a very big problem

449
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,399
that is only felt from inside the

450
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,720
context

451
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:02,959
of an organization that is uh highly

452
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:05,040
dependent on a wide array of

453
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:07,199
open source projects especially across

454
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:10,079
different ecosystems

455
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:11,519
uh and so just to to underline that and

456
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,000
what we need to do is we need to have

457
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:14,639
many different

458
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,399
kinds of solutions to to the nuanced

459
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:18,880
conversation about sustainability

460
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:20,320
so if all you have is a hammer of money

461
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:22,959
to apply to

462
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:24,160
foss liberally uh fair enough that that

463
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:26,079
might actually

464
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:27,839
be the answer for some things maybe more

465
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:29,199
money into security research into

466
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:31,040
vulnerabilities in a particular

467
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:32,560
ecosystem or a particular

468
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:34,319
language what what have you might

469
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,920
actually solve some problems

470
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:38,399
uh but that's not going to work for all

471
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:40,079
of them uh in fact uh

472
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:42,000
it may be the case as as dwayne said

473
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:42,479
that they actually actively don't don't

474
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,040
want

475
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,600
the money uh and and we need to find

476
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,519
multiple

477
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,199
kinds of hammers for multiple kinds of

478
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:50,560
nails and we

479
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:52,479
also need to be having the nuanced

480
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,119
conversation recognizing the places

481
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:56,240
where

482
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:58,079
it's not about sustainability that uh

483
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,680
making making poor poor decisions for

484
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:01,120
yourself is also a part of this

485
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,959
conversation making poor business

486
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,880
decisions as part of this conversation

487
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:06,719
uh and then our interdependency is also

488
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:09,920
is also important to

489
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:11,199
recognize as well so i want to unpack

490
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,000
just a little bit of what what's on the

491
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:13,680
slide here

492
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,279
right because without any additional

493
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:17,199
context these might look harsh

494
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:19,040
or or unkind and that's never their

495
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:22,160
desire um

496
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:22,560
if if there is a maintainer who has a

497
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,160
job

498
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:27,119
and is also maintaining a bunch of

499
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:29,680
projects in their own personal time

500
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:31,680
and finds that they are pouring so much

501
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:33,120
time into those personal projects that

502
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:35,120
they're burning out

503
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,959
in addition to there being some other

504
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,800
kind of problem there are problems

505
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:40,800
around boundary setting for the project

506
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,319
or the or and the maintainer right

507
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,839
as a maintainer you are not obligated to

508
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:46,959
say yes to anything

509
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:50,000
right um what will be helpful

510
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:52,399
is for the project to clearly state

511
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,600
these are the this is the scope of the

512
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:55,040
project and these are the

513
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,560
these are the this is the level of

514
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,519
commitment that i have to this project

515
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,518
right now so that

516
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:00,959
adopters who show up to use it

517
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:03,279
understand what they're getting

518
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:04,000
so maintainer burnout because they're

519
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:06,000
over investing

520
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,359
personal time in their projects is at

521
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,520
least as much

522
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:11,520
about boundary setting as it is the

523
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:13,119
other factors that come into that

524
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,879
there are definitely projects that have

525
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:16,079
grown much much faster than the support

526
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,319
structure around them

527
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:19,520
right in popularity and in usage and

528
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:21,678
consumption and

529
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:22,959
we could we could debate and carol and i

530
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:25,760
have at times about

531
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:28,079
the role the company should play in

532
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:30,559
establishing some policies

533
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:32,080
to around the technology that is adopted

534
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:33,760
there so that you're not adopting

535
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:35,520
technology that is growing faster than

536
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:37,120
it's getting support

537
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,879
but for projects that have grown faster

538
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,320
than the supports those are important

539
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,320
for us to mobilize and support if

540
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:44,960
they're that important

541
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:46,159
there is i i cannot say there is not a

542
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,480
problem with companies

543
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,600
over consuming on open source and under

544
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:52,080
uh giving back

545
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:53,520
right so we definitely should be working

546
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,678
within our companies uh

547
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,639
across the board to make sure that we

548
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:58,400
are giving back

549
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,840
in some amount of proportion to the

550
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,960
value that we're deriving from those

551
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,480
projects

552
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,559
uh signal to noise i've already talked

553
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:06,480
about a little bit and there's also

554
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:08,000
a problem for the companies bear

555
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:11,200
responsibility for

556
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:13,280
where uh the emphasis is put so much on

557
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,400
developing features and pushing out new

558
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:17,120
product

559
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:18,400
that there is no time allotted for

560
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,840
developers to

561
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:22,000
maintain and support the things that

562
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:24,480
they have brought into the company right

563
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,000
if a company is running on seriously

564
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,960
outdated uh free and open source

565
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,360
software

566
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:31,200
the odds are they have prioritized

567
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,799
feature work which is profitable

568
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,799
over the maintenance work which is

569
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:42,240
equally important and that is a problem

570
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:44,480
of balance that we have to shift

571
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:46,400
uh yeah we have a couple minutes for

572
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:49,200
questions and i will repeat the question

573
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:52,000
uh for the folks on live streaming yeah

574
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:54,480
so on the previous slide

575
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,360
which one would you say is probably like

576
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,039
the low

577
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:58,879
fruit like if we were to tackle this

578
00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:01,679
tomorrow what would you say from

579
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,679
your experience

580
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:05,360
so the question was of the five that we

581
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:07,120
have up here which one would be

582
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:09,840
kind of the low-hanging fruit or most

583
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,840
most prolific

584
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:13,360
i'll take a swing at that like it kind

585
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,400
of depends on what tree you're standing

586
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:17,760
next to

587
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:19,360
right um from from the from my position

588
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,640
running an open source program office

589
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,439
the lowest hanging fruits the things

590
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:24,480
that i have

591
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:27,200
most um immediate ability to impact

592
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,559
is our company's role in supporting and

593
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,760
maintaining our dependencies and it's

594
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:30,799
sort of been the focus of the work that

595
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,760
i've been doing there for the last

596
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:33,760
couple of years

597
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:35,280
um that is a very different tree to a

598
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:37,760
maintainer right

599
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:38,639
um so i it might be a bit of a cop-out

600
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,520
because i'm not going to give you my

601
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,360
opinion but my

602
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:43,039
my challenge then is to figure out which

603
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,159
tree is closest to you that you can

604
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:47,120
affect

605
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:48,720
and mobilize the people who like you can

606
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,959
affect that particular tree that would

607
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:53,840
be

608
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:53,840
my answer other questions

609
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:59,039
okay uh so

610
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:01,280
so i know you're trying to tell story

611
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:05,360
with the three examples

612
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:08,240
but if we put aside the good actor could

613
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:10,879
turn into the bad actor for event stream

614
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:12,080
we also didn't know about the security

615
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:15,760
vulnerability until

616
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:18,158
research was applied to it right so

617
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:21,039
how is that like if we set aside the bad

618
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:21,039
actor part of it

619
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:26,719
so the question is if we if we for a

620
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:29,120
second set aside an event stream the

621
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,840
good actor versus bad actor how is that

622
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:32,000
different from

623
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:34,320
heartbleed and and therefore probably a

624
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,400
sustainability problem that you you

625
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:40,480
would apply resources to

626
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:40,480
you have anything to say okay

627
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:45,039
i'm not sure i'm not going to come down

628
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,960
either way

629
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:48,480
on on answering like maybe it's no

630
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:51,840
different or maybe it is but

631
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:53,600
there is a thing that that i'll say um

632
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:55,360
there was there was some conversation in

633
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,879
the previous talk about automated

634
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:58,559
dependency updating and tooling to

635
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,480
enable that tools like renovate tools

636
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:02,000
like dependebot and greenkeeper

637
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:04,559
and david and there are a number of

638
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,880
others that sometimes are ecosystem

639
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:08,639
specific and so on uh because it's

640
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:12,320
seeking to reduce the toil

641
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:15,280
of of getting on top of this

642
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:16,559
growing ever-growing tens and thousands

643
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:19,440
of dependencies

644
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:20,000
uh a problem of keeping things up to

645
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,159
date

646
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
right if all they're doing is making it

647
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:25,360
easy to update

648
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,720
it doesn't really solve the problem does

649
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,600
anybody have automated dependency

650
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:31,600
updating going

651
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:34,240
on a project right now okay a few

652
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:36,000
anything built into that process to see

653
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:38,320
what the nature of those different

654
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,520
uh what the difference is between the

655
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,480
thing you're updating from the other

656
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:44,080
thing you're updating to

657
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:46,159
is it just yeah without that

658
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:47,199
um event stream probably would have hit

659
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:48,799
a lot more people

660
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,559
right we automatically updated to this

661
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:51,679
thing even if it went through the code

662
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:53,520
paths and said hey

663
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:55,039
the code paths that you know we have in

664
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,799
here have coverage it doesn't mean that

665
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:58,400
it's not is going to prevent it from

666
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:59,520
doing what it was already doing and also

667
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,480
this other little thing that you didn't

668
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:03,760
know about so

669
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:07,280
it is a big complicated problem um

670
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:09,919
we can apply more research to it and and

671
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:12,158
and apply more uh either effort from

672
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:14,000
security or dollars to security but i

673
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:15,360
will also come back to

674
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,840
that question of the thousands of

675
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:19,760
dependencies in my in my inventory

676
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:21,199
which ones are i can i can get pretty

677
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:22,879
close to which ones are most important

678
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,200
to start by how often they show up but

679
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,960
that

680
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,240
we know that figuring out which ones of

681
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,840
those are really critical for us to be

682
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:29,440
taking a look at as a hard problem if it

683
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,639
wasn't we'd found it already

684
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:32,400
i was just going to add on to that that

685
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,799
i think i think that really highlights

686
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,720
that

687
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:36,240
this is a very nuanced conversation and

688
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,960
we need to have it in a nuanced way

689
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,280
which is

690
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:41,600
um if we we we have to look at each of

691
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:44,320
these problems and consider

692
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:46,639
that there could be multiple ways to

693
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:49,520
have solved it or to have avoided it

694
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,840
um and that some might look like others

695
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:52,559
some

696
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:54,240
might be solvable by assert by money

697
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:56,240
some might be solvable by

698
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:57,600
having more developers some might be

699
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:00,000
solvable by uh

700
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:02,000
you know more contributions upstream

701
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,000
what you know whatever the case may be

702
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,520
and that it it might be the case that

703
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,960
they look very similar but that we need

704
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:08,400
to have the nuanced conversation to

705
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:11,919
understand the

706
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:13,280
the nuance and the potential solutions

707
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:14,640
we we still have time to take a couple

708
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,600
more questions so if you have one by all

709
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:18,400
means put your head up

710
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,799
uh uh head up hand up um one of the

711
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,400
things

712
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:22,080
one of the points that we didn't make

713
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,919
but wanted to make was that

714
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:25,360
painting everything with the broad brush

715
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:27,039
of sustainability

716
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,320
makes it difficult to know what we're

717
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:30,240
really talking about so if the only

718
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:31,840
thing that you do after this talk

719
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:34,080
is when someone says there's a

720
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:36,559
sustainability problem if you say

721
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:37,678
what specifically do you mean you can at

722
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:39,840
least make sure you're on the right page

723
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:42,080
and then i saw a couple hints

724
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:43,918
yeah so um a couple of times it's been

725
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:46,720
mentioned like how do you evaluate

726
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:48,840
your thousands of dependencies but what

727
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:50,559
doesn't seem to come up

728
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:51,760
is a thousand dependencies in the first

729
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:54,399
place

730
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:56,320
so for my projects um i could probably

731
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:58,720
name the entire dependency graph

732
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:59,600
or any of my projects less than physical

733
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,799
fantasies

734
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,639
and the people who work on them are

735
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:04,158
people i know shaking most of their

736
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,520
hands i've talked to them all the time

737
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:07,600
having that relationship with your

738
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,879
dependencies to me is the strongest way

739
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:11,439
to avoid these problems

740
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:12,880
sure um how many developers work at

741
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:16,240
microsoft

742
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:19,039
best guess 60 000 that's how

743
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:20,720
right like you could do it maybe i could

744
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:22,720
do it and

745
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:24,080
but you know and maybe there are 600

746
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,919
different projects and maybe they break

747
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:27,600
down into teams of six

748
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:28,799
and you can establish a policy that you

749
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,840
shouldn't consume anything that you

750
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:31,760
don't know

751
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:33,678
but even if you're only talking about

752
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:36,400
direct direct dependencies

753
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:37,279
the odds of that really happening i

754
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:41,200
think are low

755
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:44,480
right uh it's a good place to be

756
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,480
i'm sorry i agree

757
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:49,679
as a good place to start and there's

758
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:52,640
some validity to that right if you have

759
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:54,240
25 different libraries that are managing

760
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:56,159
uh date formatting

761
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:57,760
you can probably do better than that

762
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:58,799
right are there other questions

763
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:02,559
we have two minutes i think we should

764
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:02,559
probably okay one last question

765
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:06,719
i was just gonna comment on that okay

766
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:14,480
okay

767
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:16,559
thank you thank you thank you very much

768
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,559
you
