1
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:07,919
okay

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,920
we're gonna have to go with slides that

3
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:12,960
are over there

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:15,519
that's gonna make this interesting but

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,960
as i'm two minutes in already let's get

6
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:18,960
started

7
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,320
my name is brett sheffield from the

8
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,600
librecast project

9
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:26,800
uh which is now part of the ngizero

10
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,760
program for decentralizing the internet

11
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,760
building a new

12
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,960
uh better internet uh if you're

13
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,480
interested in that

14
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,640
and how you can perhaps get some funding

15
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:37,360
for your project then uh

16
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,239
come and see me afterwards and uh

17
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,480
there's also a

18
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:41,839
an ngi zero buff this afternoon where

19
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,839
there'll be lots of people from

20
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,520
ngi zero projects and the nl net

21
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,640
foundation guys who can

22
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,200
you can talk to them about getting

23
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:51,039
funding uh i think given this is the

24
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:54,399
decentralized everyone that'll be

25
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:57,280
quite applicable so um

26
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:58,239
just before we begin uh can i borrow you

27
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,359
for a sec

28
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:02,879
i just want to give you a choice um we

29
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:04,960
could do this talk in a

30
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:06,640
a unicast way or we can do it in a

31
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:08,240
multicast way

32
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,680
uh so just to give you an idea of what

33
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:12,720
that might be like

34
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,680
in a unicast world i i'd need to to

35
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,600
start

36
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,240
with a handshake and we'll need to

37
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:20,798
maintain that tcp handshake throughout

38
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,000
the talk and then if you could all just

39
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:24,880
form a line

40
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,280
uh behind him here i can deliver the

41
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,798
talk to you one at a time

42
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,320
now of course i'm being ridiculous we're

43
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:30,880
much cleverer than that in unicast

44
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:34,798
aren't we

45
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:37,360
um i could do two of you at once uh

46
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:39,200
or maybe you could attach to my legs uh

47
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,560
but that's probably about my limit

48
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,079
obviously the more connections i'm

49
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,439
maintaining i'm having to repeat the

50
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:45,279
same information

51
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:46,479
the load on me as the speaker is going

52
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,520
up and up

53
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:52,158
well that's that's unicast thank you

54
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,520
or and i realize this might be the first

55
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:56,960
time for some of you

56
00:01:53,520 --> 00:02:00,399
we could do this in a multicast way

57
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:02,559
essentially by coming to this room

58
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:03,920
you have performed a join on my

59
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:07,360
multicast group

60
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,560
thank you that's going to save a lot of

61
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:12,400
time

62
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:15,840
so who's for unicast

63
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:17,520
always 102 and multicast

64
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,360
okay well i didn't need 10 minutes i've

65
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:22,000
already convinced you all that multicast

66
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:24,239
is better than unicast fantastic i

67
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,520
haven't got off my first slide yet

68
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:29,280
so uh that was a librecast logo uh let

69
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:32,319
me tell you about the project

70
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,360
um basically uh i'm aiming to get

71
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:36,000
multicast

72
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,599
working across the internet decentralize

73
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,480
the internet with multicast and the way

74
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:39,840
i'm doing that

75
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,920
is by putting it in the hands of you

76
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:45,200
guys developers

77
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:47,359
we already have a librecast

78
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,720
multicast library so you can build your

79
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,040
applications with that just

80
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:53,359
include librecast.h other languages

81
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:55,599
coming soon but at the moment it's c

82
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,720
uh we'll be building a messaging library

83
00:02:55,599 --> 00:03:01,359
on top of that

84
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:02,879
uh a lr0mq very similar

85
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,319
we're also building transitional

86
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:05,518
technology on top of that which is

87
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:07,440
essentially tunneling

88
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:10,159
this is not new stuff that i'm doing

89
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,599
here this is 30 year old technology

90
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:13,359
that i'm bringing you today if you

91
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:15,040
remember the m bone or

92
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:18,000
given we're in brussels cast gate

93
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:19,760
perhaps this has been done before

94
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,920
it's just not been done with ipv6 and

95
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,599
it's not been done well

96
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:26,000
we're building an improved routing

97
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:28,798
protocol to break the dependence of

98
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,040
multicast on unicast and i'm building

99
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:33,599
some multicast enabled applications

100
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:35,920
and trying to work with foss projects to

101
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:37,839
enable multicast everywhere

102
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,958
and also ensure that new standards such

103
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:42,080
as webrtc

104
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:44,159
and quic which are based on udp do not

105
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,319
exclude multicast

106
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:47,359
so uh you can't really see that but

107
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:49,760
basically if

108
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,959
you've used xeromq before the api is

109
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:54,159
very familiar

110
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:55,120
uh download my slides i'll read that to

111
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:58,480
you

112
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:00,400
in 2001 rfc 3170 was written

113
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,679
it says ip multicast will play a

114
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,799
prominent role on the internet in the

115
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,879
coming years

116
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:06,799
it is a requirement not an option if the

117
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:09,280
internet is going to scale

118
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:10,959
multicast allows application developers

119
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,040
to add more functionality without

120
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:17,040
significantly impacting the network

121
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:19,279
now that was 2001 um what year is it

122
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,040
so yeah we're not really using multicast

123
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:22,400
most people have

124
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,880
heard of it but there are a lot of

125
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:27,120
misconceptions it's largely ignored

126
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:29,280
multicast is more efficient than unicast

127
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,680
it's more scalable than unicast

128
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,559
it has important privacy advantages over

129
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,520
unicast

130
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:37,160
no destination address for a start uh

131
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,320
it's the missing piece in the

132
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:40,560
decentralization

133
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:42,000
puzzle which is important for this dev

134
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,479
room and it can also

135
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,040
help make this fellow which is a polar

136
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:47,039
bear

137
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:49,040
uh quite a bit happier as well because

138
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,680
multicast is far more efficient we can

139
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,080
build less

140
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,759
data centers and that's important so

141
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:56,479
what is multicast

142
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:58,240
we'll start with the definition um

143
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:59,280
you've probably heard that unicast is is

144
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,720
one to one

145
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:03,520
yeah and uh broadcast is one to all

146
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,720
nodes

147
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:10,320
multicast is one to many yeah

148
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:14,000
you all heard that that's wrong um

149
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:16,159
no form of ip multicast in use today

150
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,600
works like that it's not one to many

151
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,360
it's one to a group

152
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,360
in the case of unicast you set the

153
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,400
destination in the case of multicast you

154
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,840
do not

155
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:27,280
you send to a group it's pub sub

156
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,198
so unicast and broadcast are

157
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,400
fundamentally different and there's no

158
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:31,919
point in doing the next bit because you

159
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,638
can't see it but basically unicast and

160
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:35,840
broadcast

161
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:38,560
are push and multicast is pull you can't

162
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:41,119
spam with multicast

163
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,240
i'll skip over that um many

164
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,240
misconceptions

165
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,759
are around multicast that it's only good

166
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,560
for streaming it's no use for video on

167
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:50,560
demand it's unreliable it's insecure

168
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,160
it can't work on the internet and that's

169
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,400
all wrong

170
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,919
multicast is essentially about group

171
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,479
communication

172
00:05:55,919 --> 00:06:00,080
and the funny thing is all communication

173
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:01,840
is group communication

174
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,758
even one to one is just a very small

175
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:06,318
group

176
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:08,800
so the problem with unicast is it leads

177
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:12,560
to massive centralization

178
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:14,720
thank you slides um multicast leaves

179
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,319
open the possibility of decentralized

180
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,960
designs by default

181
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:19,759
multicast is decentralized by default

182
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,239
and that's an

183
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:23,759
osi layer diagram which you're all

184
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,120
familiar with

185
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,800
there are many of you here working on

186
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,800
decentralized solutions but you're all

187
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,960
working at layer seven the application

188
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,080
layer we can decentralize at the network

189
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,680
layer layer three

190
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,599
that's far more efficient and saves you

191
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,280
a lot of coding

192
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,840
here's a real world example which is

193
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:43,039
going to be difficult to show you

194
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:44,719
but if you can imagine that i have a

195
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:48,000
forking web server

196
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:51,039
and that is plugged into a

197
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,039
a local bridge

198
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:55,840
then yeah this is i'm running out of

199
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,560
time and i don't have a slide to back me

200
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:00,799
up

201
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,800
so essentially

202
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:04,479
that's impossible to show you without

203
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:06,479
that so if you want to know more about

204
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:09,440
it and hopefully with slides

205
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:09,919
come to the iot dev room uh a bit later

206
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,960
on

207
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:14,799
i'm talking at 12 10 and i have a longer

208
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:17,280
slot to talk to you about it

209
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,639
there's also a video from my lca talk

210
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,318
where i had a full hour to

211
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:22,560
tell you what i'm trying to tell you

212
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:26,160
with no slides in 10 minutes

213
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:31,430
so um come and find me in the

214
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:41,110
the ngi zero bathroom this afternoon

215
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:41,110
[Applause]

216
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:45,360
fabulous
