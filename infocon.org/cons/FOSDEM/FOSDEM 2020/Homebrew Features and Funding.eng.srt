1
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,040
so we're gonna

2
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:09,040
anyone who's been to one of my homebrew

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,719
talks before we'll know there's a lot of

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:12,559
hand raising that has to go on

5
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:14,239
so i'm sorry so who is who's heard of

6
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:18,000
homebrew before

7
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:19,520
now very good who uses homebrew

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,600
hopefully you have heard of it if you

9
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:23,279
use it uh who's submitted a pr to

10
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,039
homebrew

11
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:28,720
anyone submitted a pr to hombre which

12
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:28,720
was closed and rejected by me

13
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:32,079
note the majority of the people with

14
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,800
their hands up are homebrew maintainers

15
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:35,360
so that's

16
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,879
that's fine um great who likes putting

17
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:41,200
their hand up

18
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:43,680
way very fun all right so

19
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,760
my deeper there we go uh if you want to

20
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,680
talk to me about anything in this talk

21
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,440
easiest way is either twitter or my

22
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:51,199
personal email which is on github and my

23
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:54,399
website and stuff like that

24
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:56,079
i come here with two hats on generally

25
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:57,760
i'm not going to talk too much about

26
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:58,000
anything github related today but that's

27
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,079
my

28
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,160
day job they pay my bills they pay for

29
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:04,000
me to be here thank you very much github

30
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,920
i've been there about six years and i'm

31
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,280
working on github sponsors now

32
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,280
if you find any of that stuff

33
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,840
interesting then feel free to like

34
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,960
just grab me hopefully not physically

35
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,320
during fosdem and

36
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,000
talk to me about it and we can have

37
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:17,600
interesting conversations

38
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,840
and similarly about homebrew do you want

39
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:22,158
to talk about stuff like that

40
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:24,320
right so this talk i'm going to talk

41
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:26,080
about features and funding in homebrew

42
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,439
these two things are completely related

43
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,039
they're definitely not just two blog

44
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:31,039
posts i wrote that are jammed together

45
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:35,200
to make a normal size talk

46
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:36,400
so who likes features in software

47
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,720
if you haven't put your hand up i'm a

48
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,720
little bit concerned uh particularly new

49
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,280
features are generally nice i like it

50
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,880
when

51
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,320
i get to work on new features and i like

52
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,839
it when i release new features that

53
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:48,240
other people like

54
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,360
which is very exciting but a lot of the

55
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,360
time new features

56
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,399
are not very good when i first released

57
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,520
them because

58
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:58,799
i socket coding so

59
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:01,199
the problem with homebrew pre 1.0

60
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,640
is homebrew there's a lot of design

61
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,439
decisions that are made that

62
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,399
might look smart but are generally made

63
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:08,639
just because

64
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:10,479
me or one of my predecessors are

65
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:12,000
extremely lazy because

66
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:13,760
that's how it is one of the nice things

67
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,520
about being a software engineer for a

68
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,799
living and doing open source i'm sure a

69
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,599
lot of you can relate to this

70
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,360
is the pain of knowing how what you

71
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:22,000
would actually do if you had time to do

72
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,760
things the right

73
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,080
way which i don't have time to do

74
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:28,480
because i have now two small children

75
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,599
and they don't tend to allow me as much

76
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,560
time as my

77
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:34,238
paid overlords i get up to to do things

78
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,680
like write as many tests as i would like

79
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:38,000
etc etc

80
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,120
so one of the things you probably may or

81
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,760
may not know

82
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,720
with homebrew is it uses git and github

83
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,200
pretty heavily

84
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,879
so when you are doing updates of the

85
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,079
package repository or updates of the

86
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:50,879
package manager itself

87
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,879
that's just doing a git pull from github

88
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:56,160
essentially so

89
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:57,518
before homebrew 1.0 when you ran brew

90
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,359
update

91
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:00,720
or eventually when that became automated

92
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,319
for you then

93
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,239
effectively that's just doing a git

94
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:05,280
fetch checking what the latest version

95
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:07,680
is on github

96
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,879
and pulling that down for the package

97
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,440
manager itself

98
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:12,159
and for all packages now this is quite

99
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,920
good

100
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:15,440
when you want to just have everyone

101
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:18,159
running the same thing all the time

102
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:20,000
but it's not good if you like new

103
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:21,359
features that are not broken because it

104
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,599
makes it quite hard

105
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,560
to have subsets of users that you roll

106
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:28,079
features out to

107
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:30,480
when they are not quite ready yet so now

108
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,799
as of we're now a homebrew two point

109
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:35,840
whatever

110
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:38,080
most people will now end up

111
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,040
when they run brew update on a stable

112
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,640
tag

113
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,798
instead so we now tag things in the

114
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,640
repository so when you run brew update

115
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:46,159
the main package manager itself not the

116
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,640
packages we don't have any plans to do

117
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,640
that

118
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,319
but the package manager itself you will

119
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,119
kind of jump between tags if you are

120
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:53,518
most people

121
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,400
but if you are some special people then

122
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:56,159
you will get

123
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,680
effectively the same workflow as before

124
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,959
you will be on whatever the tip is of

125
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,640
the master branch

126
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,319
and whatever the latest commits are so

127
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,720
that means if i push some

128
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:06,480
pr or new commits or whatever it may be

129
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,840
then you will get them almost

130
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:11,040
immediately

131
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:14,159
now you you may wonder am i

132
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:15,439
some people or am i most people right

133
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:17,519
i'll tell you later but

134
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:19,358
ponder that question for now the way

135
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:22,560
more software generally works

136
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:24,000
for doing betas and handling kind of

137
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,680
features that maybe aren't quite ready

138
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,440
yet or just

139
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,360
big refactors that might maybe aren't

140
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:32,080
quite ready at is they might

141
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:34,240
pop up some little box asking people if

142
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:38,080
you want to use the beta or not

143
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:39,520
or in shorthand do you like bugs

144
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:42,080
or if you want to be a little bit more

145
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:44,400
philosophical do you hate yourself

146
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,758
personally i find almost any software i

147
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,960
use on a day-to-day basis that asks me

148
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:47,759
if i want to use the beta channel i

149
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,320
never do

150
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:52,240
because like the general fact is because

151
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,960
i'm using software i generally want it

152
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,320
to work

153
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,479
and when it doesn't work i definitely

154
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:58,240
get very annoyed

155
00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:00,320
another problem i found is because i've

156
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,240
been working from home from 10 years

157
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,080
i'm not really used to like working in

158
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,840
an office environment so

159
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,599
now when software doesn't work the way i

160
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,840
want it to work my reactions are

161
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:12,240
increasingly

162
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:13,119
ridiculous loud and violent towards my

163
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,120
computer

164
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,400
so i don't really know that beta

165
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,080
software is good for

166
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,479
me or the structural directory of my

167
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,840
house at this point

168
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:23,599
on homebrew we do things a little bit

169
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,960
differently that basically the

170
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,759
fundamental question

171
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,320
with homebrew instead of asking yourself

172
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:30,000
you know

173
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,840
do i hate myself enough to try this new

174
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,199
software it's really about

175
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:38,719
do i hate you and the answer is no

176
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:39,360
of course i don't well obviously i do

177
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,759
still hate

178
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,120
some people around homebrew a little bit

179
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,320
probably no one in this room there's

180
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,680
enough people blocked on the homebrew

181
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,199
github organization that

182
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,199
you know that probably indicates a

183
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:51,199
little bit but

184
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:52,240
i mean to be serious though why do i

185
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:55,280
hate you

186
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:57,520
enough to make you some people

187
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,559
why do i hate you enough to make you sit

188
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,240
on the

189
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,000
on the master branch when you could be

190
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:06,800
on a lovely nice stable tag that's a lot

191
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:09,600
more tested

192
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,319
well so if you end up grouped in that

193
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,360
little group

194
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:13,840
i happen to think you're a little bit

195
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,039
special i happen to think you're curious

196
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,719
there's something about you that makes

197
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:20,000
you a little bit different from

198
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:21,600
the average person in the world and

199
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,759
i think you're probably a bit more

200
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,520
likely to be helpful and

201
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,960
that's a weird thing for me to have

202
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,880
maybe attributed about you without

203
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:32,840
knowing anything else about you

204
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:36,080
so how do i identify these things

205
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:37,280
well in homebrew we have the concept if

206
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,919
you look in the man page

207
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:42,159
we group our commands by we have

208
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:44,639
commands and we have developer commands

209
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,000
so a homebrew command might be the

210
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:49,199
normal way that you would use homebrew

211
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,440
with something like brew install wgap

212
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:52,800
most people are using these when they

213
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,880
invoke homebrew when they

214
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,880
work with it this is how most people's

215
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,159
entry point to homebrew is through these

216
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,319
but then we also have things called

217
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,440
developer commands which are what you

218
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:02,479
use if you want to contribute to

219
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,160
homebrew if you want to

220
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:05,440
be a homebrew maintainer if you want to

221
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,240
submit a pull request you're going to

222
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,400
make some changes

223
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,039
even just like locally for yourself then

224
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,198
you're going to run one of these

225
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:15,520
developer commands

226
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:17,919
so the fun fact is we track

227
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,880
not externally but we track on your

228
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:20,240
local machine

229
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:23,039
whether you've ever run a developer

230
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:25,199
command or not and 99.9

231
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:26,960
of people never have and point one

232
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:30,400
percent of people have

233
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:32,799
so 99.9 of people get

234
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:34,560
the stable branch i realize now i flip

235
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,400
these the wrong way around but oh well

236
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,319
uh 99.9 percent of people get the stable

237
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:40,159
branch and 0.1 percent of people get the

238
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:42,880
master branch

239
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,479
so again why would we do this this is

240
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:48,240
maybe a little bit weird

241
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:50,080
so this was based on experience over the

242
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,680
years of kind of observing how these

243
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,479
different groups of users tend to file

244
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,720
issues

245
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:55,680
so people who've never run development

246
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,960
commands

247
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,520
you tend to get issues that look a

248
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:01,440
little bit more like this

249
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,799
those of you who are maintainers of any

250
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:05,840
software would know

251
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,960
the dreaded phrase it doesn't work it's

252
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:09,198
generally not

253
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,239
super helpful in figuring out exactly

254
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:11,520
what the problem is

255
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,000
and what the changes are that need to be

256
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:16,000
made to do things to be fair though

257
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,400
i'm not blaming these people because

258
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,800
again with tools like homebrew despite

259
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,878
being

260
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,639
i guess sustainably a developer tool

261
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:25,599
it's now increasingly used by

262
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:26,000
a lot of people who are may not be

263
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:28,400
developers

264
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,360
at all maybe following some guide online

265
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,280
whatever it may be

266
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,479
and they're not familiar with the kind

267
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:35,679
of

268
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:37,200
open source free software bug reporting

269
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:38,958
way of doing things they don't know that

270
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,719
you need reproducible instructions etc

271
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:42,799
etc

272
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:44,240
but as a result since we kind of made

273
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:45,599
this move

274
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,120
people who only have run developer

275
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,120
commands tend to make bug reports that

276
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:52,080
look a little bit more like this

277
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:53,760
or quite a lot of the time i would say

278
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,959
50 of the time when it's a bug that's

279
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:57,600
affected them directly and is a

280
00:08:54,959 --> 00:09:01,199
relatively simple fix instead you get

281
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,200
something like this which is very nice

282
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,600
this is generally when this is explained

283
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:07,680
i find

284
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,800
89 of people go oh that's interesting

285
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,439
whatever and

286
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,399
10 of people get very upset and don't

287
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,320
like this idea

288
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:15,279
that we are deciding for them

289
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,320
effectively whether they get the

290
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:18,240
unstable stuff or not

291
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:20,080
if you are one of those people then you

292
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,680
can set this in your environment

293
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:24,000
homebrew update to tag that basically

294
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:26,239
says even if you run a developer command

295
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,760
or anything like that you always want to

296
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:30,160
be on the stable branch so

297
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:32,480
don't trick you into ending up on the

298
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:35,279
master branch inadvertently

299
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:37,200
if you're the opposite and you're just

300
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:38,160
excited to get out there and find some

301
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,080
bugs

302
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,279
then you can set homebrew developer

303
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,800
equals one that will go

304
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:44,959
and that does a few more things that

305
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,319
will partly make sure you're always on

306
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,680
the master branch but then there's a few

307
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:51,279
things that are

308
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:53,279
warnings or don't print warnings um

309
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:54,640
but that will then turn into errors and

310
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:55,600
stuff like that which would be useful

311
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,760
for you to help

312
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:00,240
us fix generally if you want to set this

313
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:02,720
though the i would say the high level

314
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,440
for a command like for a flag like this

315
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,680
is

316
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:07,120
i'm prepared to submit pull requests to

317
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:09,279
fix things that i encounter

318
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,240
if that does not feel like you then feel

319
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:13,920
free to

320
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:16,720
not set that so

321
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:18,240
sometimes we get situations where we are

322
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:22,160
working on new features

323
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:24,560
where that like split between

324
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,279
master and stable tags is not quite

325
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:28,000
enough

326
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:28,959
so again a lot of stuff we do we will go

327
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,040
and

328
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:32,880
make a new change whatever it may be and

329
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,959
then we do a new release

330
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,240
of the package manager itself maybe once

331
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:38,719
a week or so

332
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,240
and then once things kind of get into

333
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,320
that stable tag then they'll get rolled

334
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,839
out to everyone i normally kind of

335
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,040
you know if we roll out something a bit

336
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:46,720
more dramatic then we'll give it a

337
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,000
couple of days before we do a release to

338
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,079
make sure that kind of

339
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,160
any of those beta testers have been able

340
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:53,920
to kind of potentially pick up on that

341
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,959
file an issue file a pr whatever it may

342
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,160
be and also like the homework

343
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:57,279
maintainers themselves because again

344
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:00,000
we're all on the

345
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:01,279
beta channel effectively but sometimes

346
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,320
that's not enough sometimes you need

347
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:04,880
something which

348
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:06,640
is going to last a bit longer that may

349
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,760
need toggled on and off for individual

350
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,880
machines or individual people or

351
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,800
whatever it may be

352
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:12,560
so for that we use feature vlogs who's

353
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,160
familiar with the concept of kind of

354
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:17,199
feature flagging

355
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:21,360
okay like some people might everyone

356
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:23,040
so again back to the feature problem of

357
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,399
you know we might want people to try our

358
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,560
new features but

359
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:27,920
often they are completely broken when we

360
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,680
first make them particularly with stuff

361
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,880
like homebrew there's some stuff where

362
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:33,359
if we want to change the way the

363
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:36,320
compilation process works for example

364
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,839
it's not feasible for me to test 4 000

365
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,000
packages on my machine

366
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:41,120
before i roll that out to everyone um

367
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
but at the same time i don't want to

368
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:45,760
just rule that out to everyone

369
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,240
and break their stuff so again do i hate

370
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:49,279
you

371
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:50,880
not yet because i want to try and make

372
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:52,000
sure this stuff is a little bit more

373
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,720
refined

374
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,279
before it ends up being with you so

375
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,160
generally

376
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:58,720
the way we do that is similar i guess

377
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,079
before

378
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,120
the way basically everything is

379
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:02,160
controlled in homebrew is through

380
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,600
environment variables

381
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,199
because we don't have a configuration

382
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,560
file we just decided this is the way we

383
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,440
like to do things

384
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:11,279
so we let users set environment rails

385
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,880
for these particular cases so generally

386
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:14,160
in the first case if i'm rolling out

387
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,880
something that i suspect is really

388
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,800
broken

389
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:18,240
then the first person to set that will

390
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,880
be me i will set that on my personal

391
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,240
machine

392
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:22,000
because i'm using homebrew for like work

393
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,560
stuff and i'll basically wait to see

394
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,600
what breaks internally in the code

395
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,959
obviously we're checking for the

396
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,240
presence of that variable

397
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:30,000
and then we can do like slightly

398
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:32,560
different logic internally whether you

399
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,680
have that flag set or not

400
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,119
then if we want to go a little bit more

401
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:37,359
advanced than that we can check if

402
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,800
hundred developer is set so that's gonna

403
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,720
basically group in all of the home room

404
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,760
maintainers and anyone who manually sets

405
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,040
that flag

406
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,439
for which i don't think there are a

407
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:47,519
whole number of people but again that's

408
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,959
sort of the group who've opted in to

409
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:50,639
receiving more warnings and problems and

410
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:53,359
stuff like that

411
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:54,079
then if you we want to not just put

412
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,000
something in

413
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:57,359
the master branch or stable tag we can

414
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,519
check that's the

415
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:01,120
equivalent variable that's set for us

416
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:02,880
for people who have run a developer

417
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,399
command at some point

418
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,959
and then at that point then it generally

419
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:09,600
ends up in the stable branch

420
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:10,399
so the the flow through these things is

421
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,240
generally

422
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:14,560
the first person testing a new feature

423
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,079
that i makes at least is going to be me

424
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,680
then it's going to be our ci system we

425
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:18,319
might initiate black globally so we can

426
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,239
see that

427
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,760
across all the packages then various

428
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,680
maintainers will enable it

429
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:26,079
then the people in the beta channel and

430
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:28,638
then everyone else

431
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:30,399
so hopefully then we end up with new

432
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:32,720
features that are not completely broken

433
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:33,519
so a brief side tangent for an employer

434
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,680
plug

435
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:38,000
so that's one of the things about github

436
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:39,279
that i kind of stole this idea from

437
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,040
from them obviously people have been

438
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:42,959
doing feature flagging before github but

439
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,160
they do the stuff generally very heavily

440
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:46,560
internally as well

441
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:48,480
so almost anything i work on a github is

442
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:50,880
going to be used by

443
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,160
feature flagged at least if it's some

444
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,680
new feature or some

445
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,279
big change in behavior it's going to

446
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:57,519
feature fly to just me first

447
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:58,800
then my team then the employees at

448
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:00,800
github and then

449
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,399
sometimes we have stuff if it's very

450
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:04,639
relevant to open source maintainers

451
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:05,680
we'll flag in like people in a kind of

452
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:07,760
set

453
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:09,279
maintainers community we have and then

454
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,639
we've started doing more like beta

455
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:17,439
opt-ins and things like that

456
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:19,199
and then we roll out everyone

457
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,800
so the next part of this talk there's

458
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:22,479
not really a great segue but i'll try

459
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:25,680
and make one up anyway

460
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:29,279
so talking about funding so

461
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:31,120
again we there's a lot of talk about

462
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:32,160
feature development and open source kind

463
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,360
of getting better and better and stuff

464
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,519
like that

465
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,480
and it's been in the last few years i

466
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:38,000
don't know how many of you

467
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:40,160
picked up on this a lot of talk about

468
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,639
like oh no it's open source broken

469
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:44,160
because you're starting to see big

470
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:46,959
companies who make

471
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:48,319
things you know like maybe maybe you

472
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:50,399
make some sort of thing that's maybe a

473
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:53,360
bit like a database but even better

474
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:54,720
and you want to write a bunch of codes

475
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,720
over the years to make this

476
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,399
amazing not quite a database but almost

477
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,680
like a database really really good

478
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:01,040
and you want to release it under an open

479
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,479
source license and have lots and lots of

480
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:04,880
people use it

481
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:06,320
but the problem is you can't get anyone

482
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:09,600
to give you any money

483
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:11,519
so you basically go

484
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,199
and maybe see if you can convince people

485
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:14,480
to pay you for the open source project

486
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:15,120
and no one really does and stuff like

487
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,240
that so

488
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,839
you're asking yourself well how can i

489
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:19,440
make new feature development okay i'll

490
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:20,240
make a company around my open source

491
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,720
product

492
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:24,000
and then you because you're making open

493
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,279
source

494
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,040
no one's going to pay you directly for

495
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:28,639
your thing but maybe if you go to some

496
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,599
people who can help people with stuff

497
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:32,240
like this

498
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,519
then they can generally you know throw

499
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,440
some money at you

500
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:37,600
and then that might help your company to

501
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,880
grow over the years and things like that

502
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,480
and then but the problem is eventually

503
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,680
you get to a point where your company is

504
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,120
making me making some money but they're

505
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,758
still not profitable and whatever it may

506
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,880
be

507
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:48,560
and then you you hit a bit of a wall

508
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:50,560
where you realize like oh there's all

509
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:52,800
these big kind of cloud providers who

510
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:54,560
are not in our opinion giving us the

511
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,240
fair share that we're due

512
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:57,839
and then as a result you go and

513
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,880
re-license all your stuff to non-open

514
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:00,399
source licenses

515
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:02,399
you then say that that is open source

516
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:04,079
software still and try and make package

517
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:05,360
managers pack your stuff anyway

518
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:07,359
and just keep telling everyone that it's

519
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:09,519
open source even though it's not anymore

520
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:12,079
and then go around telling people oh

521
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:13,600
open source funding is broken so

522
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:14,959
is open source funding broken though in

523
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,399
my opinion open source companies are

524
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:18,638
broken it doesn't really work

525
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:19,600
to have vcs fund massive organizations

526
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:21,600
who are going to go

527
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,880
and then just change their licenses five

528
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,040
years later

529
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:26,880
but in short i don't really care about

530
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:30,160
this problem and neither should you

531
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:31,839
because i think the problems that bigger

532
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,600
organizations who might make open source

533
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:34,880
databases and then change their licenses

534
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,120
a few years later to other things not

535
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:38,399
that i would name any names

536
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,759
the types of problems these types of

537
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:41,279
organizations have i think are

538
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:42,320
completely irrelevant to the open source

539
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:44,399
ecosystem as a whole

540
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:46,000
because actually at the end of the day

541
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:47,920
what does your project need money for

542
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,040
probably it does not need money for a

543
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:51,360
shiny office

544
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:53,519
it does not need money for a tesla in

545
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:55,839
your drive it does not need money for

546
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:56,800
a whatever other things venture

547
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:58,399
capitalist

548
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:00,560
money injections to your organization

549
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:01,920
give you so

550
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,439
if you want your tesla you're gonna have

551
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,399
to figure out another way of doing it

552
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,480
but

553
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:08,000
if the problems you are having which

554
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,599
means that your project needs money

555
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,959
are things like you need places to host

556
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:11,918
your binaries and that actually needs to

557
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:14,480
be paid for

558
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:16,400
or you need some sort of cloudy thing to

559
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,679
run some services in and that has bills

560
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:20,000
that needs to be paid

561
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:21,919
or in our case you need a ci system that

562
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,079
actually tests all your packages

563
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:26,240
but none of the kind of cloud-coasted ci

564
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:28,079
systems is anywhere near the scale

565
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:29,520
or provide the infrastructure that you

566
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:30,720
need then

567
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,639
you're going to need to get some money

568
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,720
somehow from somewhere

569
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:36,400
so homebrew found ourselves in this

570
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:39,120
situation in 2013

571
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,679
we didn't have any ci back then it

572
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,239
wasn't

573
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:43,200
as much of a thing certainly back then

574
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,760
travis

575
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,880
ci wasn't supporting mac builds and

576
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,400
stuff like that so

577
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,760
there was basically nothing that looked

578
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,960
like it was going to be an option for us

579
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:53,039
really to do

580
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,880
so we wanted to get some money and the

581
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:56,559
way you got money off random people on

582
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,760
the internet you didn't know in 2013 was

583
00:17:56,559 --> 00:18:00,879
kickstarter

584
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:01,520
so we launched kickstarter we got enough

585
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:05,280
money

586
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:07,039
to buy ourselves some computer hardware

587
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,480
and then we installed that and kind of

588
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:09,360
ran that for a good few years and that

589
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,840
was fine

590
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:13,120
unfortunately we had a few problems with

591
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,918
this right so

592
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:16,479
partly having physical hardware means

593
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:18,000
that

594
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,760
some sort of humans are going to have to

595
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,200
manually deal with that normally the

596
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,919
humans who are physically closest to the

597
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:25,360
hardware

598
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:26,480
which was me and that sucks when that

599
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:29,678
person is you

600
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,640
all the time secondly we had leftover

601
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:32,080
money from the kickstarter that we

602
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,960
wanted to do stuff with at some point

603
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,280
and we

604
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,559
feel kind of we are obligated to do

605
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,960
something with at that point but that

606
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:40,000
was

607
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:40,880
again in a bank account in the uk in

608
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,799
pounds

609
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:45,360
and i was the only maintainer in the uk

610
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:48,240
so again that was non-ideal as well

611
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:50,000
and this stuff is all sounding very bus

612
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,440
factory of one so

613
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,520
i was trying to go and shopping for

614
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:56,000
other solutions so

615
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:57,520
in 2016 we kind of started talking with

616
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,880
the software freedom conservancy

617
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:00,879
after looking at various other kind of

618
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,440
software foundations and thinking that

619
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,880
was

620
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,559
the route homebrew was going to kind of

621
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,679
start to go down in order to kind of

622
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:07,918
have some

623
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:09,360
basically more bus factor around our

624
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:11,760
finances and stuff like that so

625
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:13,678
that provides us with a legal entity so

626
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:15,120
that entity could be the thing that owns

627
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:16,720
things like physical hardware rather

628
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:19,600
than any individual

629
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,559
it provides us with a 501c3 which is in

630
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,399
the us

631
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:25,039
the shorthand for an organization that

632
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:27,120
can receive uh donations and then people

633
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:29,440
can claim that back in their tax return

634
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:30,799
and like companies like stuff like that

635
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,600
for donations as well because it makes

636
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:35,039
it basically

637
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:37,840
more valuable for them to give you money

638
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:39,520
and again with it being 2016 we had like

639
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:41,120
a paypal account that we could get money

640
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:43,360
sent to us relatively easy for and

641
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:44,879
donations and the bank account if people

642
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,439
want to go like in physically wire

643
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:49,120
transfer

644
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:50,240
stuff so companies generally prefer this

645
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,120
route though so this was a little bit

646
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,880
more handy

647
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:54,239
but the problem with this model of

648
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:56,000
having

649
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:57,520
like get just celestine donations and

650
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,080
getting them

651
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:01,039
is it's not very stable you know you

652
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,879
might get a nice

653
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:04,080
and we've got some big like one-off

654
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,760
anonymous 10 000

655
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:07,280
donations from big organizations or

656
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:09,120
whatever it may be and that's really

657
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,240
cool and really helpful but that doesn't

658
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,520
particularly if with the stuff i

659
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,960
mentioned before if you're paying a

660
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:15,039
monthly fee for something

661
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,880
you don't want big lump payments you

662
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:18,640
want you would happily take lower

663
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,440
payments which are rolling on month over

664
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:24,400
month of

665
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:24,400
the month so in 2017

666
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:29,120
we moved to that way of asking people

667
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:30,960
for money on the internet which is

668
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:34,239
patreon

669
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:35,520
and that worked for us relatively well

670
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:37,360
we started to get a little bit of kind

671
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:39,360
of monthly income and things like that

672
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:40,959
but again you still have that problem of

673
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,799
how do you actually solicit

674
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:44,240
for people to give you a bit more money

675
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:45,360
so we started off by just putting it in

676
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,760
our readme and saying

677
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,479
yo we could do with some money for x y

678
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,559
and zed

679
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,640
please give it to us that didn't really

680
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:54,960
work very well like again we got

681
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:56,320
drugs and drabs but most people are not

682
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,159
checking that section of the readme to

683
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:00,639
see stuff like that

684
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:01,919
then 2018 we have like uh i think 10 000

685
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,480
followers on twitter or whatever at this

686
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:04,159
point

687
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,360
so we pushed on twitter kind of asking

688
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:06,320
and then we saw a little bit of an

689
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,479
uptick there

690
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:11,120
but the really impactful thing to our uh

691
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:12,799
funding in 2019 was we added a little

692
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:15,360
message to the application itself and to

693
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:15,360
the installer

694
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:20,720
so when you first install homebrew

695
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:22,559
or when we roll out really things which

696
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:24,000
we think are important to users such as

697
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:26,960
stuff like analytics

698
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,559
we display a little one-time message we

699
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:30,559
check that you have a tty which is

700
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:32,399
basically our way of

701
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:34,240
more or less seeing while you're not

702
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,120
running this within some other script

703
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:37,039
and you're probably going to actually

704
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,879
see this message and we do like a

705
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:40,400
console beep and stuff like that

706
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,840
so we've done that previously for kind

707
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,120
of analytics to let people know that

708
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,320
this is a thing we're doing and how to

709
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:46,080
opt out

710
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,600
so we thought hey we could do this as a

711
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:49,280
one-time message people will only see

712
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:52,480
this once per machine

713
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:54,639
or when they install a new machine

714
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:56,080
to solicit some donations more or less

715
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:59,039
just saying okay would you like to

716
00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:02,480
donate to the project and then

717
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:05,520
that's what happened here-ish so

718
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:07,039
that that made a really so this was when

719
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:08,320
we saw it started i guess just before

720
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:10,000
2017

721
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:12,000
and had just the donation stuff in the

722
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,000
readme again picking up slowly over

723
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,200
time big jump there when we started

724
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,000
asking on twitter

725
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:19,440
and then the jump when we added the

726
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,440
little mag message was

727
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:23,200
fairly ridiculous so and since then

728
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,720
we've been sitting fairly

729
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,320
sort of statically on between two and a

730
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:29,039
half and three thousand dollars a month

731
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:31,280
which is pretty great um and then as of

732
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:32,240
2019 we've added kind of gab sponsors

733
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:34,240
which is

734
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:35,919
like plug plug that's something i work

735
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,720
on at work so that's a nice other way

736
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:39,280
for us to kind of

737
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:40,080
get funds organizations are still in

738
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,360
beta for that

739
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,799
so we were kind of one of the early

740
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,080
organizations to get into that but again

741
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:45,120
within the next few months that should

742
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:47,918
be open to all

743
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:49,039
organizations um but again that's a way

744
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:50,000
that we've been able to get monthly

745
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:52,000
income through

746
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,200
uh the github platform and that's like a

747
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,240
few hundred dollars a month at the

748
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,159
moment as well

749
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:57,360
so with that combined we have kind of

750
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:58,240
two and a half to three thousand dollars

751
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:00,240
a month which

752
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:02,320
actually now gives us enough money to

753
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,960
partly have maintainers fly here and we

754
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,240
have a

755
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:06,159
our annual general meeting for the

756
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:08,080
second time on monday

757
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:09,200
and partly to start actually paying for

758
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,960
hardware and things like that that we

759
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,720
need to run the project effectively

760
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,640
and we've done this without selling user

761
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:16,240
data which is again things which

762
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,520
we've been accused of doing in the past

763
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,559
people worry about stuff like that with

764
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,840
analytics but it's something that we

765
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:21,520
wouldn't ever consider

766
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:23,120
we've done it without asking people to

767
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:26,240
donate again and again and again

768
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:28,559
like again i i kind of i don't

769
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:30,240
mind when programs i use do that because

770
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:31,678
i feel like that's within their right

771
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,600
but you do have to wonder like if

772
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:34,720
someone has said no thanks i don't want

773
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,719
to donate like three

774
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:38,240
or four times how likely they are in the

775
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,760
fifth sixth or seventh time to

776
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:42,320
decide to donate and not just get really

777
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:44,480
annoyed we've done that without having a

778
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:46,240
sort of like homebrew pro edition some

779
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:48,320
special version of homebrew with

780
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:49,520
features limited which are not open

781
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,480
source so people need to pay for or

782
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:53,120
whatever

783
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:55,039
and surprisingly we've done it without

784
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:57,360
anyone really accusing us of selling out

785
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:58,400
and we've not had any backlash as far as

786
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:00,320
i can tell

787
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:02,320
to our donations and our funding stuff

788
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:04,399
this may will both be partly because

789
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:06,158
we my advice maybe to other projects

790
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:08,720
would be we effectively don't

791
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:09,360
really make any promises on what you

792
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,960
will get

793
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:13,120
for donating to homebrew and what the

794
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:13,600
money will be spent on except the fact

795
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,559
that

796
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,639
you know we're part of a software

797
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:18,399
foundation and this isn't going to be

798
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,679
like none of the money has gone in any

799
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,960
maintainers pockets

800
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:22,559
individually or directly or anything

801
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,840
like that and before that would happen

802
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:25,678
there would be a very

803
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:27,279
formal process of contracting and stuff

804
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:29,360
like that so basically

805
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:30,880
although we can't promise you what your

806
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,520
money would be spent on if you donated

807
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:33,520
to homebrew

808
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:35,520
we can say that it will be used to kind

809
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,918
of for the project's mission and not

810
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:39,440
just

811
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:41,279
to buy me a tesla so with that

812
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:43,600
i think we can say that homebrew is

813
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:44,960
still quite good and

814
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,480
things seem to be going better for the

815
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,840
project as a result of doing this

816
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:51,039
funding changes

817
00:24:47,840 --> 00:25:01,120
so thank you very much and do we have

818
00:24:51,039 --> 00:25:03,200
time for questions

819
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,199
you
