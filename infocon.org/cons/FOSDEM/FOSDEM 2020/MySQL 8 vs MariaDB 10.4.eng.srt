1
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,200
you can start because anyway

2
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:16,560
nobody else will enter in the room

3
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,680
anymore ah i see i see and i said you're

4
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,479
going to say well but you can start

5
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,480
because nobody cares

6
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:29,920
no no okay yes you know fred is uh

7
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:30,320
so polite so nice to everyone so belgian

8
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:33,920
well

9
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:35,840
yeah uh i may not be

10
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,200
anyway uh we are going to talk about

11
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,079
this uh

12
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,360
uh very uh interesting topic uh about

13
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,399
mysql eight

14
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:47,760
and mario dv 10 4 which are

15
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:49,120
uh latest version of those to respectful

16
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:53,280
databases and

17
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:56,320
even though uh huh you see

18
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:58,399
oh now it turned out even though

19
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,079
fred gave me extra five minutes i

20
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:03,120
planned for 20 minutes

21
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:06,799
uh right and as i uh

22
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:09,840
look at this uh uh problem

23
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:10,400
uh or uh this uh this content uh there

24
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,760
is

25
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:16,240
so much of a difference

26
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,680
uh those days between the latest mysql

27
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,439
and and marie dv

28
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,119
it's really hard to go in the feature by

29
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:25,758
feature right and explain it

30
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:29,360
in in 20 minutes that would require uh

31
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:32,640
like a day tutorial uh if not more

32
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:35,759
so i decided to instead focus on mostly

33
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:39,840
uh high level comparison right not going

34
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:40,799
in a very uh high level uh a very low

35
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,520
level

36
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,880
details one thing i think is important

37
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:48,640
to know is what

38
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:53,199
uh if you look at the mysql and marietv

39
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:56,479
is what marie db is not mysql

40
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:59,680
not anymore i think it first uh

41
00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:01,439
uh the in the first right then

42
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,040
at a region there was a very little

43
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:06,240
difference when it was

44
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:08,560
you know five five version but uh at the

45
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,919
uh later times there is a lot of uh

46
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,000
changes both and

47
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:14,480
what you have to do as administrator as

48
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,920
well as the things you have to

49
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:19,760
hear or as as a developer right

50
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,200
some of those things i think this is i

51
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:24,239
would say the differences

52
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,760
of uh of a worst kind if you will right

53
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:28,959
because you would have

54
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:30,079
uh their sql syntax right the functions

55
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:33,280
of features

56
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:35,120
which are uh the same

57
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,480
syntax wise but they have a subtle

58
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,959
differences in behavior

59
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,959
right and why i call those things the

60
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:42,160
problems the worst kind because if my

61
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,319
egb has a function

62
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:46,079
and mysql doesn't then it's very simple

63
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:48,720
your application just wouldn't run

64
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,680
right if it functions have some subtle

65
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:53,680
corner k

66
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:57,120
a corner uh cases about how it performs

67
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,560
then your application may fail in uh

68
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,640
in kind of a tricky scenarios right and

69
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,760
that is something which is uh we just

70
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,559
had a very hard

71
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,359
harder test so keep it in mind uh right

72
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,879
a

73
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,800
number of applications those days

74
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:10,079
especially if you think about the drupal

75
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,319
right of wordpress

76
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,720
uh they tend to support both my uh my

77
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:15,679
edb and mysql but that requires a

78
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,840
special

79
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,280
effort by development teams to take

80
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,840
software for both

81
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,800
database systems right don't assume if

82
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,319
you have been

83
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,159
developing for years just from high

84
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:29,040
school or just from our adb you can just

85
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:29,679
move your complicated application and it

86
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,159
works

87
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,440
absolutely the same with no changes

88
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:36,319
having said that

89
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:37,120
i will say what those are both great

90
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,879
databases

91
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,720
right we have developed a very strong

92
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:43,440
followers very

93
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,920
large community they have been both

94
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:47,040
growing

95
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:50,000
very rapidly you may have seen uh

96
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,120
mysql for example getting the uh award

97
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,799
from db engines

98
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,280
about the being the database of a year

99
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:58,799
of 2019

100
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:02,080
which we didn't get like for

101
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:03,280
i don't know like ever right and uh

102
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:06,239
marietv was a

103
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:08,159
uh running up last year second only to

104
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:11,439
postgres so both of them are

105
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:13,840
uh doing well now uh

106
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:14,959
in terms of i will try to be a fair but

107
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:18,000
mine kind of fair

108
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:21,680
i hope i will offend

109
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:25,919
uh and give things to disagree uh for

110
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:27,759
both mariedb and mysql team members

111
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:29,198
and the communities and i see there's a

112
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:30,560
fair amount of development team

113
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,560
presenter

114
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,600
representation so if you don't agree

115
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,280
with me

116
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,120
then shoot peter you're on that is

117
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:43,840
 right let's keep

118
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:43,840
fosdom spirit going right fred

119
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,120
okay so let's uh start from a

120
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,840
development model

121
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:53,520
right we all know what the mysql is

122
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:56,638
developed by the oracle

123
00:04:53,520 --> 00:05:00,479
uh oracle corporation right

124
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:04,240
and uh contrary to some uh uh

125
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:06,800
uh rumors right uh oracle actually does

126
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,360
accept uh contributions right there have

127
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,680
been

128
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,600
a number of things both small and large

129
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:15,360
which have been accepted and

130
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:16,320
included in uh in the uh recent mysql

131
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,360
release

132
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:21,120
oracle uh offers also follow what i

133
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,600
would call like a dropship open source

134
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,039
model

135
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,479
right so it's not like all the

136
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:27,280
development all the kind of small

137
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:29,599
patches every commits are immediately

138
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:31,440
visible in a github but when the oracle

139
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:34,880
releases the new release

140
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:38,000
we have a source which uh

141
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:39,360
which magically appears if you look at

142
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,840
for my agb

143
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,919
here is uh i think is uh interesting

144
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:47,280
right because if mario edb there are

145
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:50,320
uh you know two involved entities

146
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:52,400
uh marie db uh

147
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,360
corporation and mariadb foundation and

148
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,919
different

149
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,720
components which may we may use in an

150
00:05:55,919 --> 00:06:00,240
ecosystem

151
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:02,960
is uh owned by those uh different

152
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,919
entities right so for example uh my adb

153
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:07,599
server is

154
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:10,240
released by uh mariadb

155
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:12,639
foundation right and a lot of

156
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,680
development in roadmap is mostly driven

157
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:16,319
by

158
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,280
marijb corporation right in terms of

159
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:20,319
features which

160
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:21,599
go in at the same time contributions are

161
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:24,639
very much

162
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:26,240
encouraged right i think marie db spends

163
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:29,280
a lot of time

164
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:32,080
and effort to really invite people to uh

165
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,799
uh to contribute right and uh uh this is

166
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,840
a two

167
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,680
uh i would say two sides uh coin because

168
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:40,960
on an extent that really

169
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:43,440
gets uh more stuff in marie db but then

170
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,159
uh that also means you may have a uh you

171
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:47,600
know

172
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:49,280
not as much consistency

173
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,360
between the features right you have more

174
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:53,440
stuff to maintain there can be

175
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,520
more stuff which is of uh unknown

176
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:58,160
quality because it was

177
00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:00,080
sort of contributed right but then

178
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,400
developer who have been doing that

179
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,280
is not really interested to do that

180
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,280
anymore

181
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:08,000
and the marijuana foundation which is in

182
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:09,359
charge with maintaining the sierra it is

183
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,639
a

184
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,120
relatively small company right they

185
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:14,319
cannot really maintain everything which

186
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:17,599
was contributed

187
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:20,880
over years and development uh for

188
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:24,080
um for mariadb is done uh

189
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:26,319
uh he is done much more uh

190
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,520
much more in public i would say what

191
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:29,680
everything what the

192
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,120
marietv foundation does right is of

193
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,720
course

194
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,720
completely in public but there could be

195
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,319
bits and pieces which are developed by

196
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,319
the third parties and then

197
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:40,080
kind of also drop shipped right so for

198
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:43,199
example if you look at

199
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:45,039
galera iv development right which was

200
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:46,800
developed a lot we heard about hey it's

201
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:47,840
coming in common but you could not see

202
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,879
any source

203
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:54,000
until it finally uh you know landed

204
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:56,960
much closer to the ga stage

205
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,039
now marietv corporation and

206
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:00,960
complications right i mentioned that the

207
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:03,599
relationship is complicated

208
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,799
right but first i want to say why do you

209
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:07,360
really care

210
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,720
right as a developer well if you look at

211
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:12,400
the history of

212
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:16,479
the marie db a lot of that was uh

213
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:20,479
uh based on well you know what

214
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:21,120
oracle bought mysql it's going to kill

215
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:24,479
it

216
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:26,400
right or at least screw it up a big deal

217
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:27,599
we don't want to happen that again right

218
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,679
so there is

219
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:30,800
mariju the foundation to prevent that

220
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:33,360
from happening

221
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,880
because in the end if you think in a in

222
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,519
a corporation

223
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:38,640
nothing prevents from oracle you know

224
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:42,719
theoretically

225
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:44,720
to uh to buy marietv corporation right

226
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:45,760
that is a company of investors and so on

227
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,080
and so forth right

228
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:49,360
i was in my school in the early days and

229
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,920
we never imagined

230
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:54,399
that my skill will end up in oracle

231
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:57,680
hands at that time right but that's

232
00:08:54,399 --> 00:09:00,959
exactly what uh what happens

233
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:03,040
so uh so why that is important is

234
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:04,880
if you are really looking at the maria

235
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:08,240
uh db from the

236
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:09,920
uh you know from an insurance standpoint

237
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,360
right you need to understand what is

238
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:14,560
provided by my edb

239
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:17,440
foundation versus not because

240
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:20,000
if uh marie db kind of corporation is

241
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,000
bought by

242
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:25,040
another oracle another company right you

243
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:28,480
want to know what's will

244
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:29,680
kind of remain uh maritime foundation is

245
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,959
really

246
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:35,120
uh responsible for marie db server right

247
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:38,399
many other companies such as

248
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,959
connectors max scale are owned by marie

249
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:41,040
db

250
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:42,640
corporation a lot of the stuff that

251
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:47,519
mariedb corporation does

252
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:47,519
is open source some things like

253
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:55,199
the max scale uh is not right it's uh

254
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,719
uh there's bsl now there are also some

255
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,080
things which i would find strange right

256
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:01,040
so for example

257
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:03,200
where you look at the majority of

258
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,079
repositories and packages for linux

259
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,959
distribution

260
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:08,000
are uh managed and provided by marietv

261
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:11,439
foundation

262
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:14,160
but then uh docker builds

263
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,880
are uh no no the docker bills are done

264
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,199
by

265
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,079
uh marietv corporation right so it can

266
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,959
be

267
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:23,279
really complicated from my opinion to

268
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:25,760
understand who is doing what

269
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:27,760
okay now let's look about the open so

270
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:30,560
what is open source

271
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:32,000
when it comes to the mysql like when you

272
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:35,040
hear what the mysql is an

273
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:38,079
open source database of course this is

274
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:39,599
not entirely the true right mysql is an

275
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:42,640
open core database

276
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,279
there is a mysql community server right

277
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:46,240
which is

278
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:47,040
open source as well as a lot of other

279
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,240
tools

280
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:53,279
which exists which are uh which

281
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,920
are open source i think what is

282
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:56,240
interesting

283
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:58,719
about the oracle mysql approach we keep

284
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,720
the whole

285
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,160
whole platform has an open source

286
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:04,640
version right so there is a

287
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:06,719
uh you know thing like a mysql router

288
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:10,160
there is open source version of a

289
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:12,399
uh uh you know my skill shell

290
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:14,640
and uh whatever right so their approach

291
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:17,680
has been here well you know what you

292
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:19,839
should be able to spin it up uh and do

293
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:23,199
everything with the open source version

294
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:23,200
right then um

295
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,720
there are some enterprise features which

296
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:30,480
is

297
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:31,279
uh part of a uh enterprise platform

298
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,680
right

299
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:35,920
uh enterprise is really focused on the

300
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,239
commercial license plugins and tools

301
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,719
right

302
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:40,560
and i would say even in this regard uh

303
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,959
oracle is actually

304
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,920
doing a good job for themselves but

305
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:47,439
actually for also for

306
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:50,399
third parties by uh not having kind of

307
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,680
another enterprise source code right

308
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:54,560
which is kind of

309
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:55,359
uh sparkled with enterprise features but

310
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,359
having

311
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:59,120
enterprise features as plugins which

312
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,360
allows third parties

313
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,399
to implement similar functionality as

314
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:06,800
they want

315
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:08,800
right uh purecorner has implemented

316
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,880
you know similar functionality for many

317
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,599
enterprise options and i know a number

318
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:14,639
of

319
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:16,079
uh people who has been doing that that

320
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:18,240
themselves it is uh

321
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:19,760
possible and i think what is also

322
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,279
interesting in this case is what the

323
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:25,200
mysql

324
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:27,920
only adds uh

325
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,639
add some new features some of them go to

326
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:31,760
enterprise

327
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:33,040
some of them they go to their uh to a

328
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,920
property or some fm

329
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,959
actually seems to be slated for oracle

330
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:39,199
cloud only

331
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:40,719
right some of us have heard about this

332
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,519
you know wonderful rapid engine for

333
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,160
example

334
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:44,959
but what i think is is great is oracle

335
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:47,360
uh

336
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:48,319
never took anything back like oh that

337
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,880
was

338
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,000
open source license and uh that's not

339
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:54,240
anymore

340
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,560
in my giveaway space we have a multidb

341
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,560
server is obviously open source

342
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:00,160
multidb connectors are open source

343
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:03,279
through many of them are managed by

344
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:06,480
uh by corporation

345
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:08,000
uh there are some other parts of the

346
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,839
sort of complete solution

347
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,519
and most importantly i would say max

348
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:14,160
scale is

349
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:15,680
not open source and i think what is also

350
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,680
interesting in this case is what very

351
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,959
easy history what max scale was open

352
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,959
source and later was a

353
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:22,000
real license proprietary right so that

354
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:23,920
is a question

355
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,279
to what exactly may follow that rule

356
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,519
depending on the

357
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:28,639
marie db corporation business needs and

358
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:31,760
business pressures

359
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:34,720
right of course we can be sure uh my

360
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:36,240
my edb server is going to remain open

361
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:39,360
source for two reasons

362
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:42,720
right a it's my edb foundation and b

363
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:45,920
because it uses a lot of original

364
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:47,120
code base from mysql and oracle right

365
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:50,319
they can't really

366
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,760
realize on that for marietv enterprise

367
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:54,639
server

368
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:56,399
right you can uh that is as a part of a

369
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:56,959
marijuana enterprise offer and you can

370
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:58,959
see

371
00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:00,239
what it is open source but an open

372
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:01,920
source

373
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,600
for customers right that means you don't

374
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:05,439
really find it on a github

375
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,959
but if you are the customers then you

376
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,839
will be provided access to the source

377
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:11,760
code

378
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:13,600
uh together with uh uh

379
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:15,040
you know the binaries and to be frank

380
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,760
that is something about

381
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:19,279
school one of the iterations in a my

382
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,079
school history that's what my school

383
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:23,279
used to do right

384
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:24,880
many years ago okay so

385
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:27,199
another thing is interesting is

386
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:29,839
relationship with the open source

387
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:31,760
and the community version where mysql

388
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:32,480
enterprise is a super set of mysql

389
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,560
community

390
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,760
wherever runs whatever you use in mysql

391
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:38,638
community

392
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:39,519
is included in mysql uh is mysql

393
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:42,399
enterprise

394
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:43,519
right and there they're also aligned on

395
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:46,000
a release schedule

396
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:47,279
right so when you have uh you know eight

397
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,880
zero goes ga

398
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:53,680
mysql and mariedb it is the same

399
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:55,439
in in a marietv case mysql enterprise

400
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,479
server is extended separate set of

401
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,880
community server

402
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:00,160
so that means there are some features

403
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,839
right which are

404
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,360
additional an enterprise plug-in for

405
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:06,160
example

406
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,760
it would have a you know enterprise

407
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:09,439
audio plugin which has some additional

408
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:11,040
functionality but there are some things

409
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:14,639
which is included

410
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:15,760
in a community edition of mysql which

411
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:19,040
which is not

412
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:22,720
included in the enterprise and also

413
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:25,279
mariadb platform right which is

414
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:27,279
how mariju enterprise version is called

415
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:30,000
uh works on a separate life cycle

416
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:30,480
right so marie ddb104 was released what

417
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,519
uh

418
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:37,199
last summer my maritime platform

419
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:40,800
x4 which is uh based on marietv 10 4

420
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:42,560
was released just in the last uh

421
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,800
last few weeks right so that is i think

422
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:48,079
is also um

423
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:49,599
interesting interesting difference

424
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:51,439
now another phoenix interview is

425
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:54,079
interesting is uh

426
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:55,279
about the cloud native right supporting

427
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:58,319
kubernetes

428
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:59,519
ecosystem right and in this case i would

429
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:02,000
frankly say what

430
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:03,199
both mysql and mariedb get thumbs down

431
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,639
for me

432
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:09,680
right i mean if you look at mysql

433
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:11,360
they have been uh doing heavy release of

434
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:13,359
my school kubernetes operator

435
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,880
when alpha was released was about like

436
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,079
two years ago they're very excited

437
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:18,079
saying yeah

438
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:19,599
that's cool mysql understands that

439
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:22,880
community is important

440
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:26,240
but that was not uh updated for uh

441
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:27,839
eight months and there was marijuana

442
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,759
separator which was actually

443
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:30,959
one of the launch operator of red hat's

444
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:33,759
operator hub

445
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:35,199
and it's kind of disappeared in public

446
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:36,959
right and

447
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:38,240
many pages which seems to be described

448
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:42,319
in uh

449
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:44,480
what uh you know the operator

450
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,920
uh you know resultant page not found

451
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:48,959
right so i don't

452
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:50,800
know really i wasn't able to find much

453
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:52,079
public information about fate of marie

454
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:55,839
dv

455
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:57,599
operator right and

456
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:59,600
the i thought party operators existed

457
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,199
mysql of course right there are

458
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,639
some i would say helm bills from

459
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:05,678
vietnamese there is a

460
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:09,120
press labs which does uh uh the

461
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:11,280
you know some uh operator right uh we do

462
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:12,958
at percona operator for berkonix review

463
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,000
cluster so there is some ways but not

464
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:19,199
from

465
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:21,599
the main vendors uh at this point okay

466
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:23,360
let's look at the focus now if you look

467
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:24,240
at mariedb it's initially competitive

468
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:26,240
mysql

469
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:28,400
completed mysql on features right and

470
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:31,440
there may many features

471
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,960
came in marie db first right but i think

472
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,440
what is uh

473
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,080
more recently uh focus has been really

474
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,559
is a

475
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:40,000
very good enterprise database as a

476
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:44,000
target migration from an

477
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,600
oracle microsoft sql server uh and so on

478
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,760
i think another thing that marietv does

479
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:49,199
very well is visibility versus admins

480
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:51,440
like if you think about the

481
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,880
you know startup scripts command line

482
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,919
experience right versus you kind of a

483
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,880
classical

484
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:57,840
old-timer sysadmins dbas uh that is very

485
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:00,640
good

486
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:02,639
mysql i think has been focused on the

487
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:04,080
traditional mysql use case right for a

488
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:07,520
lot of uh

489
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:08,480
you know large internet companies right

490
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:11,760
many of them

491
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:15,280
uh continue to run uh mysql uh

492
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:17,600
many years in right we also did

493
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:19,280
improving sql support like cte window

494
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,719
and function so on and so forth in many

495
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:23,760
cases that lagged

496
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:27,039
behind my edb but it's now there

497
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:28,720
dog store in json has been a huge focus

498
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:30,640
and i think mysql looked at the

499
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:33,360
usability a little bit uh

500
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:34,960
differently focused maybe on kind of

501
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:37,039
developers who don't know

502
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:38,799
off i'm doing right so my edb is

503
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:40,400
usability for smart people

504
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:43,120
my skill is his ability for stupid

505
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:45,360
people uh right if you

506
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:47,439
if you think it was fair right so you

507
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,840
can have a mysql shell which allows you

508
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:51,360
to

509
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:52,480
you know provision uh configure mysql

510
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:54,879
cluster in minutes

511
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:56,960
right there uh well it will probably

512
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,559
take you significantly longer time right

513
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:02,799
if you want to

514
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:06,160
set up a galera cluster with with mysql

515
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:09,280
okay in terms of architecture i think

516
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:12,640
mysql started this work of very painful

517
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:14,080
refactoring uh the old architecture

518
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:17,760
right which is uh

519
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:20,080
tough right and i think that is a very

520
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:22,000
tough days for mysql when they have uh

521
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:23,600
you know bite a bullet and change the

522
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,160
data dictionary for example

523
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:28,320
but it's not really as stable as a

524
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:31,679
mature right it actually sucks in places

525
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:34,559
all right but uh that

526
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:36,799
i think of a long term with a low to

527
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:40,480
solve

528
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:43,520
a lot of um a lot of problems

529
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:44,240
i think uh what uh another thing i will

530
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:46,879
highlight

531
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:48,799
uh is what there have been a tendency on

532
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,440
some needlessly complex decisions in

533
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:53,840
mysql

534
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:55,679
right for example mysql gtids

535
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:58,159
oh my gosh right i mean this is like

536
00:19:55,679 --> 00:20:00,480
well if you probably don't have two phds

537
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:03,039
you don't really uh understand what the

538
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:04,640
hell is going on right and how it works

539
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:05,840
uh right in this case and with that i

540
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:08,159
would say if you look at especially

541
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:10,320
initial versions they have been very

542
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:12,559
advanced gtids but you couldn't upgrade

543
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:14,879
them live when they first roll out

544
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:16,639
in uh mysql five six right so that's

545
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:19,120
kind of practical

546
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:20,480
use case was not really uh thought

547
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:23,280
through

548
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:24,240
my eb as i mentioned is pushing the old

549
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:27,039
code base

550
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:28,880
right much further it really prioritizes

551
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:30,640
choice and flexibility right and i think

552
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,960
that also comes from

553
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:35,039
accepting a lot of contributions has

554
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:37,200
supported multiple engines right and

555
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:39,520
i think my edb team is much more kind of

556
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:43,840
closer to practical operations

557
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:45,918
right than a lot of uh uh folks in the

558
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:48,559
uh oracle development team right well

559
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:49,360
which is easier if you know smaller more

560
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:52,720
agile flight

561
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:56,320
organizations okay uh you know

562
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:58,640
five minutes yes five minutes okay um

563
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:01,520
release frequency which you can see is

564
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:03,200
different marie db is much

565
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:04,639
faster but what i think is important

566
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:07,679
here is what

567
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:10,400
um uh mari uh

568
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:11,360
what we have uh uh the change in the

569
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,440
policy right

570
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:15,439
there marie dv continues to focus sort

571
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:18,080
of like a classical mysql policy

572
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:20,720
introducing features only in major

573
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:22,320
releases we have relatively frequent

574
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,760
major releases right once a year

575
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:26,158
recently we don't have any

576
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:27,840
minor changes in the minor releases

577
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:30,880
right and in mysql 8

578
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:32,799
is evergreen raid uh release right

579
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:34,559
mysql eight forever well at least

580
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:35,440
forever as an in in the next few years

581
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:37,120
it seems

582
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,960
uh where we have a lot of the cool

583
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:41,199
features introduced

584
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:42,799
in the minor releases like you know hash

585
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:46,000
join right for example was

586
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:46,559
added in the um you know a latest

587
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,400
release

588
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:50,799
but what that also means what there is a

589
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:52,480
potential breakage with a minor releases

590
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:54,559
and you can't even do the downgrades

591
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,280
between the minor releases right which i

592
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:58,000
know

593
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,799
freaks out a lot of a mysql old-timers

594
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,000
right let's say

595
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:02,960
oh my gosh that is you know just uh

596
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:07,200
horrible

597
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:09,360
horrible okay some uh

598
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,480
uh specifics right and i have now what

599
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:12,959
three minutes

600
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:13,840
so anyway uh you'll have a slide uh

601
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:16,480
there are

602
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:17,760
differences right in for example client

603
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:19,600
protocol

604
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:21,280
uh there is a difference in terms of

605
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:22,240
what kind of interface support i think

606
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:25,280
the most

607
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:27,840
important one here is marie db uh

608
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,960
doesn't do dog store right uh probably

609
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:32,080
doesn't

610
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:35,520
believe in uh dog store uh

611
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:37,678
jason support is uh is very different

612
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,840
i would say what at this point i think

613
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:42,320
the uh

614
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:45,039
mysql uh json support is

615
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:46,240
uh significantly more advanced than it

616
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:50,240
had in uh

617
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:52,400
in marietv uh right

618
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:54,320
uh replication again is that is another

619
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,919
place a very very different mysql has a

620
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:59,520
group replication

621
00:22:55,919 --> 00:23:02,240
mighty db has a gallery replication

622
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:03,440
in my opinion in places galera db

623
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:07,280
replication

624
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:08,880
replication is still more advanced than

625
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:10,960
group replication in places and more

626
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:14,480
mature in many places but

627
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:19,039
group replication is uh is moving faster

628
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:21,440
right at a faster rate sql standards

629
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:22,720
yeah i looked at this case and i don't

630
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:25,039
think mysql now

631
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:26,799
offers something that marie dvd doesn't

632
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:29,679
in the latest version

633
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:30,080
right and mariadb has done a lot of

634
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:32,640
stuff

635
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:34,480
uh especially focused on as i mentioned

636
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,760
migration from things like oracle it has

637
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:38,480
system version tables

638
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:38,960
sequences packages and actually a lot of

639
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:42,000
some

640
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:42,720
other stuff out there if you want to

641
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,760
have some

642
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:50,400
detailed feature comparison uh

643
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:52,879
i think this moresql.com we had a couple

644
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:56,080
of articles current mysql eight

645
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:57,760
and also marie db10 um

646
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:59,918
103 right we don't have an article for

647
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:02,480
10 10 4 which adds stuff

648
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:03,840
but that is fantastic compare compare

649
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:07,120
all those kind of

650
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:08,480
detailed sql features not only comparing

651
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:10,158
them to

652
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,679
between each era but also comparing to

653
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:13,279
postgres

654
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:14,880
you know and a bunch of commercial

655
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:17,679
databases

656
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:19,520
security that is another piece which is

657
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:21,520
a very different between mysql and

658
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:23,200
mariedb right so how you manage user

659
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:26,240
accounts especially if you use

660
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:28,080
advanced features like roles plugins

661
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:30,240
very different i'm not so don't have any

662
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:34,720
time to go in

663
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:36,640
in details yeah uh optimizer

664
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:38,480
optimizer is another piece which is a

665
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:40,880
very uh very different

666
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:42,720
right both teams can show you benchmarks

667
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:46,000
to show that their optimizer is

668
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:48,720
amazing and blows up a part out of water

669
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,400
right but the thing you need to know is

670
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:52,400
it is different you should expect

671
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:53,120
different execution plans especially for

672
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,600
more

673
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:56,639
uh more complicated queries which is

674
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:59,840
important right

675
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:00,799
from uh migration and that's exactly on

676
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:04,240
time

677
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:06,240
that's uh that's it thank you fred for

678
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:08,720
keeping me

679
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,720
on track

680
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:14,799
five minutes for questions for one or

681
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:15,440
two questions not five minutes oh not

682
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:17,760
five minutes

683
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,880
okay okay yeah yeah i have some time for

684
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:23,520

when you give somebody binaries

693
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:39,678

as well right

695
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:46,559
