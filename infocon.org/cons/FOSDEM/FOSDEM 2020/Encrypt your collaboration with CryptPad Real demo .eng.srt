1
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:11,840
welcome to the lightning room talks

2
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:14,880
uh lightning talks room um so please

3
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:16,079
uh welcome ludovic to bost i was going

4
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:19,680
to talk to you about

5
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:22,880
um crit crypt yes

6
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:24,480
so hello everybody so this is a talk

7
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:27,279
about quickpad actually

8
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,000
it's more a demo than a talk the idea is

9
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:31,439
to

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,640
show the product so i'm very glad that

11
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,719
there was a talk about

12
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,040
real-time editing before i won't talk

13
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:39,200
too much about real-time editing here

14
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:42,320
we basically built a real-time editing

15
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:45,680
module a few years ago

16
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:48,239
and we realized that we could encrypt

17
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,120
data uh using that real-time editing

18
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:52,078
module

19
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:53,680
and we decided to build a product that

20
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:56,719
would encrypt all the data

21
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:59,359
so i'm a ceo of ex-wikisis it's an open

22
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:59,840
source company 40 people and and we're

23
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:01,920
working

24
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,600
mainly on the x-wiki open source

25
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,439
software which is a collaboration

26
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,720
software it's a company owned by its

27
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:09,679
employees

28
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:11,600
we've been doing exclusively open source

29
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,200
the cryptpad project is a project that

30
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,240
was launched as part of a research

31
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,280
project

32
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,720
namely on real-time editing and uh we

33
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,960
realized we could encrypt

34
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,720
and so we decided to focus on encrypted

35
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,720
real-time collaboration

36
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,158
currently the cryptpad project is three

37
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,960
full-time engineer

38
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:31,119
inside the x-wiki ss company and

39
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:34,000
contributors outside

40
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:35,040
so why cryptpad so it this is a google

41
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,799
search of

42
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:41,520
we value your privacy and actually

43
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:42,159
now when i read we value your privacy i

44
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,600
say

45
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:47,520
i think not really and

46
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,039
when i think about the phrase we value

47
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:52,640
your privacy

48
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:54,159
is value yeah actually our privacy is

49
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,520
worth a lot because that's what's

50
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:58,960
actually happening

51
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:01,759
we're getting our privacy being sold

52
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:03,520
and so it's very indeed valuable but we

53
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:05,840
cannot trust today

54
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,759
when we see a website that tells us that

55
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,920
they value our privacy because

56
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:11,599
there's so many examples that it

57
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:14,958
actually didn't happen

58
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:15,679
and so when we think about it we don't

59
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:17,520
want to be

60
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,280
people that say that we value your

61
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:22,640
privacy we want to be

62
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,360
people that actually find a way to prove

63
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:26,958
it

64
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:29,760
or to guarantee it to you and so

65
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:30,400
we thought can we actually enforce users

66
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,799
privacy

67
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,920
using encryption instead of just saying

68
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,400
we do

69
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,040
and so we're trying to build that

70
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,280
pad

71
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:41,200
alternative collaborations tools to

72
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,440
google drive dropbox or

73
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:46,560
many other collaboration tools guided by

74
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:50,079
this privacy principle

75
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:52,480
and so i'll go now to the demo so how

76
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,640
how does scriptpad actually work and how

77
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:58,079
how can you use cryptpad

78
00:02:54,640 --> 00:03:00,079
to work and while uh well

79
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,319
having your data protected so actually

80
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,519
if you go to cryptpedefr or to any

81
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:05,599
cryptid instance

82
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:06,560
here i'm on the local instance on my

83
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:09,200
computer

84
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,400
didn't really trust the network that uh

85
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,399
that things would work in

86
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,159
well enough so i have a local crypt at

87
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,599
instance actually you can install it in

88
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:18,959
a couple of minutes

89
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:19,518
it's a node.js application and even not

90
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:21,280
logged in

91
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:23,519
i can start working on encrypted

92
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,920
documents so if i click here

93
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:28,560
i create a i create an encrypted

94
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:30,640
document based on ck editor here

95
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:34,000
and what happened here is that the

96
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:36,238
channel was created to our server

97
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,920
with a channel id and an encryption key

98
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:38,799
the encryption key never leaves the

99
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:42,399
computer

100
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:44,640
it's actually in this url here after the

101
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,879
after the dash and what is after the

102
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,000
dash is never sent to the server stays

103
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:50,879
on your computer

104
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,319
in the http protocol and so here we have

105
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:54,399
an encryption key

106
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:56,480
uh which encrypts everything that is

107
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:59,840
being sent to the server

108
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:01,760
here i can i can type so

109
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,760
i can type anything i want i can

110
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:06,959
actually take this url

111
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:09,760
i give it to somebody else securely

112
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:11,840
if i give this url out i give the access

113
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,560
to my content so there is some danger

114
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,280
here

115
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:17,759
and the other person can also type i can

116
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,759
see what the other person is doing

117
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:21,680
and so i have real-time editing it's

118
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,720
working similarly to what we've seen

119
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,759
just before

120
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:27,360
uh for ygs data is being sent of the

121
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,759
server the server is dumb

122
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:32,080
about the corroboration aspect it's just

123
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:34,400
storing the data that is encrypted

124
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,120
and the other users is is retrieving the

125
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,758
data

126
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,840
and then doing the the the

127
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,560
synchronization magic to make sure that

128
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,198
if there is

129
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,320
concurrent editing it works the next

130
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:46,639
thing i can do

131
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:48,479
is that since i received this pad here

132
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:48,800
on a session where i'm actually logged

133
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:51,199
in

134
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,520
i created an account on that session i

135
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:54,560
can actually store that pad in my in my

136
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,280
drive

137
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:59,040
so i say store here and say hello and

138
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,000
what happens here is that i have a

139
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,039
second

140
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,600
uh real time collaboration session with

141
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:07,120
my drive content with b and it's

142
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:10,000
basically a session

143
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:12,880
with a json document which represents

144
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,360
the list of pads that i have in my drive

145
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:17,360
so if i go to this drive now i can

146
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,160
actually see this document hello that

147
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,560
showed up

148
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:22,960
it happened in real time so i made the

149
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:26,560
change i changed the name of the pad

150
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:29,120
in in one browser window and the drive

151
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,160
received that uh that change and updated

152
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,479
the

153
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,560
the name of the pad and here i have a

154
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:38,080
drive i have folders there i can

155
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:42,880
actually create new folders

156
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:46,400
test i can uh i can move things around

157
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:48,479
in my drive i'm i'm and this all happens

158
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:51,359
in real time if i have another session

159
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:52,080
on the same on the same drive i will see

160
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,720
the changes

161
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:56,479
right away the next thing that happens

162
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:59,759
is that

163
00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:02,479
that i want to to show in my demo uh

164
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,520
is that i can i can subscribe here i'm

165
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:06,400
uh

166
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:07,039
i say sign up and i will create an

167
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,599
account

168
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:09,599
first them

169
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,759
for and

170
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:20,400
and i won't tell you my password what's

171
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:22,240
important on critpad here is that

172
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:25,280
neither the username neither the

173
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,800
password will ever leave my computer

174
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,719
at no moment and this is actually

175
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,880
something crazy when we think about

176
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,319
we're sending our username and passwords

177
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,639
to everybody

178
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:36,720
like every website we're registering on

179
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:39,360
we're giving our username and password

180
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,960
and on cryptpad we actually found ways

181
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,520
to have you do things and have an

182
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,638
account

183
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:48,318
without ever doing that so what happens

184
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:50,960
here is that a key is created

185
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:53,039
and my account is actually the set of

186
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,840
data that corresponds to that key on the

187
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:56,800
server

188
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:57,198
and i have an account so at this point

189
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,199
here

190
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:01,440
now i have an account and what's

191
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:03,520
interesting is that my user here

192
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,560
knows i have an account i'm first name

193
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,318
four now

194
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,919
i can click and i can say now we're

195
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:10,319
friends

196
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:12,479
and actually i received a notification i

197
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:14,960
want to be friends with you

198
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:16,080
except all this happens through

199
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,000
encryption

200
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:20,639
so there was a message sent to the

201
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,199
mailbox of the user using the private

202
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,720
the public key of the user it was sent

203
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:27,599
to the mailbox of the other person the

204
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:29,680
mailbox was retrieved in real time

205
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:31,280
and we i got informed on the other side

206
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,039
that i got

207
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:35,119
that i got an invitation i accept the

208
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:37,120
invitation and now we're connected

209
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,160
what's interesting is that when i'm

210
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,560
connected

211
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,840
so what can happen here is that i can

212
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,800
create a kanban

213
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:46,878
so let me take a kanban here this is

214
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,520
another type of pad that we have so we

215
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:49,599
have about

216
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,120
ten types of pad we have ten different

217
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:52,719
type of pads in it

218
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,960
in crypt pad because the real-time

219
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,440
engine we have actually works with kind

220
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,878
of

221
00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:00,560
almost any module and this this kanban

222
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:03,280
here which is real time too

223
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,720
so i can i can i can make changes to the

224
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:07,520
kanban

225
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,400
i can actually now share it and so i say

226
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,400
share

227
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,520
and so instead of giving the link to the

228
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:14,719
other person

229
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:16,560
and relying on another channel to uh to

230
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,680
transmit the information of the path to

231
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,879
the other user

232
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:24,080
i can actually do it securely and here

233
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:25,360
oops i say let me share this pad with

234
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,359
first then four

235
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,879
and first m4 here receives the

236
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,800
notification

237
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:34,080
and here we have transmitted the key of

238
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:37,360
the pad securely between the two users

239
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:42,399
and now we have a real-time pad which

240
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:44,800
we can play with okay i can

241
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:46,320
change the color here and we have the

242
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:50,240
pad working out

243
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:53,600
we have also a chat so next to the

244
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:56,240
next to this we can chat

245
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,800
okay so we have a few things like that

246
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:00,000
uh

247
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:01,760
we can have more pads so we have a

248
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,480
whiteboard we have

249
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:05,519
code pads with lots of features and we

250
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,880
have a

251
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:12,080
sheet so we can also actually

252
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,480
work with cheat before going slightly

253
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,360
more

254
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,959
uh showing more of of what we do with

255
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,519
office documents

256
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:21,680
uh so it's a bit hard with the user

257
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:25,040
interface here

258
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:29,439
we what uh what we did is um

259
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:32,319
oops if i find the crypt demo here

260
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,680
up uh we have had the chance to receive

261
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,760
a funding from nlnet

262
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,719
and for which we built the cryptpat

263
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,560
teams feature

264
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,760
so i wanted to thank annette for that

265
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,760
funding first

266
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:43,040
uh and show what that team's feature

267
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,959
here is here

268
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,399
and so the team's feature is that i can

269
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,800
go to teams

270
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:50,560
and here i can i can create a team i

271
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:53,120
already created the team

272
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:54,000
and a team has its own drive in its own

273
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,560
chat

274
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
and we can invite people in that team so

275
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:01,040
here for example

276
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,040
i can invite fosdem for

277
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,800
there is also a processing teams to

278
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,760
invite somebody that has no account

279
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,160
initially

280
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,600
so we're making a one-time link for him

281
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:13,040
and he can then come in

282
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:16,959
and accept the invitation uh and here

283
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:20,079
uh now i received a notification here

284
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:22,000
to be invited to first then team and now

285
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:24,800
i'm invited to the team

286
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,120
i can open the team and here i can see

287
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,560
that

288
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:31,839
i'm a read-only user of the team drive

289
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:36,000
but actually i can upgrade

290
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:39,279
here the credentials and my drive became

291
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:42,320
an editable drive it actually also

292
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:44,320
works the other way and any changes

293
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:47,839
in these drives everybody has them

294
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:51,040
because it's a team drive

295
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:54,079
to um to finish the demo the

296
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:57,519
last part of the demo i want to show

297
00:10:54,079 --> 00:11:01,439
is some things around uh excel

298
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:04,880
and future things that we're building so

299
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,880
the first thing is cheats

300
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,240
here i have a cheat

301
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:12,800
which actually i will start here i will

302
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:15,199
use this one

303
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,399
and we have integrated only office

304
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:20,640
javascript code

305
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:22,959
inside cryptpad onlyoffice is the only

306
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,760
tool that exists today that supports a

307
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:26,800
large set

308
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:28,720
of all the office formats all in

309
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:30,959
javascript so without

310
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,959
relying on anything on the server and

311
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:35,439
having this in javascript allowed us to

312
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:38,479
build it inside cryptpad and connect it

313
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:42,640
to our encryption engine uh

314
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:45,040
and uh we have also so we have a a

315
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:46,399
an excel sheet here with graphs for

316
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:49,279
example so

317
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:51,839
if i say this i have my graph this is

318
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:54,959
also connected to real time

319
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:58,000
so if i have this sheet on another tab

320
00:11:54,959 --> 00:12:01,279
i can also see the changes in real time

321
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,839
and since since last week we also

322
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:05,839
support

323
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:06,800
importing importing and exporting excel

324
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:11,680
files

325
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:15,439
so here i can take a file here

326
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:19,040
up actually

327
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:22,240
ah that's good being cool

328
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:25,439
up so i take an excel file

329
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:28,160
i need to close the other one

330
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,480
so that's the complexity of the demo so

331
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:32,000
we

332
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:35,200
we need to be alone in the session to

333
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,120
to do an import and so this

334
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,959
is actually working in webassembly

335
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:41,440
because in only office

336
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:42,479
the import export code was actually c

337
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:45,680
code

338
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:49,040
uh the the the conversion tool was in c

339
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:50,079
and we did work uh where we ported the

340
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,079
whole thing to

341
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:53,279
to webassembly so that we have a

342
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:55,839
conversion tool

343
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:58,079
in web assembly so here so this is not

344
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:59,519
yet working in firefox for technical

345
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:02,160
reason but normally

346
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:04,240
starting mid-february it in the next

347
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:06,880
version of firefox it should work

348
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:08,880
it should work because firefox will have

349
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:12,160
finished its implementation of

350
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:15,760
shared buffers in webassembly so here

351
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,760
i have my my pad

352
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:22,800
and i have my my graph with scriptpad

353
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:27,359
and my excel file that was loaded i can

354
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,920
also export it

355
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,920
in excel

356
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:39,040
up

357
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:39,040
and this is a demo effect

358
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:45,599
oh it worked this was another one so

359
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:50,399
here we have my file exported from

360
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:53,440
uh to excel and open in excel to finish

361
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:55,440
this is a prototype yet because uh

362
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:57,279
as part of the same work we also

363
00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:00,720
supported adding images

364
00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:04,480
inside in inside office pad

365
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:07,360
inside excel and this is actually

366
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,360
a pad

367
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:16,560
okay let me reload just to have it so

368
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:18,959
this is also a pad which is a

369
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:20,160
working with a powerpoint document so a

370
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:22,479
a slideshare

371
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:24,639
a slide tool uh which is not yet

372
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:27,519
currently supported in cryptpad

373
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:29,680
uh but is is uh is something we work on

374
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:32,560
so we plan to release this this year

375
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:33,279
and we needed support of images here and

376
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,760
actually

377
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:36,800
the support of images is that actually i

378
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,800
can hear

379
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:40,240
ask for an image it will go to my crib

380
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:43,439
drive to get the image

381
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:47,360
so i get the images from my crib drive

382
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:49,760
that i can add in my in my uh

383
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:51,279
in my only office presentation documents

384
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:54,560
and same thing here

385
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:57,040
uh well i cannot do it with firefox here

386
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:59,359
but we also have powerpoint export that

387
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:01,839
also works in this specific case

388
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:03,519
and the latest thing i gonna show you

389
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:04,480
that we're also working on mobile

390
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:06,480
application

391
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,600
and this is a prototype of a mobile

392
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,519
application

393
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,920
uh that would be similar to google

394
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:12,800
photos so you have your photos on your

395
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:15,839
mobile phone

396
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:18,639
and you're automatically uploading them

397
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:19,519
to your to your critpad instance and so

398
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:24,160
here

399
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:24,160
uh i can see up

400
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:29,199
my these are actually the images i have

401
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:32,480
inside my crib drive

402
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:33,359
and that uh contains my photos actually

403
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:37,440
it didn't work

404
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:40,320
in the demo but if people want to see it

405
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,839
i can show it to them so thank you i

406
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,519
think we are out of time unfortunately

407
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:45,440
yeah if you have questions and want to

408
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:50,079
see more i will be very happy

409
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:50,079
to uh to show it outside thank you very

410
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:55,839
much

411
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,800
you
