and the better you are in the center the

5
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:21,600

so people can that early can join um

7
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:27,039
kadir is going to talk to us about

8
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,640
frustrations for web designers and web

9
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:31,760
developers

10
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:35,120
cadier the show is yours all right

11
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:37,280
can you hear me all right cool

12
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:39,199
so can i see a show of hands who here

13
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:42,320
thinks

14
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,200
uh chocolatine when they see this

15
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,320
picture

16
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:49,760
well can we

17
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:52,800
there let's see show fans

18
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:56,879
and who here thinks that is clearly

19
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:58,718
a proud chocolate all right okay

20
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:00,480
so now now that we have so very

21
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:02,399
obviously separated the heathens from

22
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,559
the civilized ones we can move on to

23
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:07,840
less controversial topics

24
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:08,158
um hi i'm kadir i'm the product manager

25
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,840
at

26
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,560
mdn mdm web docs and we started all of

27
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:16,320
this

28
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:17,200
with one question what are the biggest

29
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,199
frustrations

30
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,200
of developers and designers on the web

31
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,640
today and i wish answering a question

32
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,280
was as easy as

33
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:27,439
the survey that we just did but before

34
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:32,960
we jump into that

35
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:35,119
a quick intro so this is css grid

36
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:37,360
and css grid is a web platform feature

37
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:40,479
that finally allows web developers

38
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:41,600
to layout a page in more than one

39
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:44,799
dimension

40
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:46,240
in two dimensions actually um that was

41
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:49,360
not the case with

42
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,479
floats and flexbox and this

43
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,960
this project that i'm going to talk

44
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:54,320
about it started in 2017 shortly after

45
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:57,360
css

46
00:01:54,320 --> 00:02:01,360
rates was was released

47
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,360
and css great was a massive success

48
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,840
okay

49
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,799
so yeah css grid was a massive success

50
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,799
it was shipped in um most of the major

51
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,440
browsers at the same time

52
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,239
um and it was shipped with tooling uh

53
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,560
firefox

54
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:24,480
the firefox grid inspector in this case

55
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:27,680
and it was seriously awesome

56
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:29,359
um that said css grid was years in the

57
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,200
making

58
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,879
and we've known that layout has been an

59
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,440
issue for web developers at least since

60
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:40,079
the late 90s when we abused tables

61
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:41,280
to develop our uis for the web

62
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,720
so looking at this we had a few

63
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:46,959
questions why did it take until 2012

64
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:50,000
to even start working on this and why

65
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:51,760
did it take until 2017 to ship this and

66
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,840
we've known for so long that this was an

67
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:56,239
issue for web developers

68
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,840
and how was this uh coordinated to ship

69
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:59,519
at roughly the same time because that's

70
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,440
not a very common thing

71
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:04,159
like that most major browser vendors

72
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:06,560
shifted at roughly the same time

73
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:08,000
and what were the roadblocks uh and what

74
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:11,120
were the pivotal elements that actually

75
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,120
helped to move this forward

76
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,359
so we took a step back to see what the

77
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,879
whole process looked like from mozilla's

78
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,519
perspective

79
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:20,879
and um after interviewing numerous

80
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:23,599
people who were involved in the process

81
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:27,200
we identified three distinct phases

82
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:29,760
first phase is uh research second one is

83
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,879
standardization and implementation and

84
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,840
the third phase

85
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:33,840
is adoption

86
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:38,238
now as you can probably tell immediately

87
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:40,959
this is a very simplified

88
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:41,599
view of the process that really smoothes

89
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:44,879
out over

90
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:46,319
many things and it looks like a pipeline

91
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:49,120
when it's actually more

92
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:49,920
a loop or loop of loops that look back

93
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,040
on themselves

94
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:55,599
i mean you get the idea that was good

95
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:58,560
enough for us to get started

96
00:03:55,599 --> 00:04:00,238
so most of us on my team had a pretty

97
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,920
good idea about the adoption

98
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:04,239
phase because that's really where mdn

99
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,839
shines and we also had a pretty good

100
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:07,200
understanding of the standardization and

101
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,360
implementation phase

102
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,958
but what we were really interested in

103
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:14,080
was research

104
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:15,599
um so we wanted to know more about was

105
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,440
how do we learn about

106
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:18,959
web developers what web developers needs

107
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,560
what their pain points are

108
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,240
and how do we decide what to work on

109
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:25,040
next um

110
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,479
how how do we prioritize what we should

111
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:29,919
add to the web platform

112
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:31,440
or change about it

113
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:34,400
so we interviewed more than 10 people

114
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:37,040
involved in the process

115
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,960
and people who were involved in

116
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:42,320
different stages of the process

117
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:44,400
and all of them

118
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:46,000
essentially so it became clear that uh

119
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,239
there was no formal research at mosul

120
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,919
at first so we have a great ux uh team

121
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,840
at mozilla that works on firefox

122
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:53,758
they're doing an amazing job there

123
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,479
wasn't much of a formal research when it

124
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:57,919
comes to web

125
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:59,280
platform to the web platform and um

126
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:01,520
that's important because at a place like

127
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:05,359
mozilla we have

128
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:08,400
limited resources so every time

129
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:10,000
we decide to ship something we incur

130
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:12,080
serious opportunity cost because it

131
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,840
means that we cannot ship something else

132
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,359
so this is really important for a place

133
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,799
like mozilla to to have a good

134
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,919
understanding of

135
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,160
why are we doing the things that we're

136
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:20,159
doing

137
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,000
and this is what we heard from people

138
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,440
about how things are prioritized

139
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,320
and there's one thing that really stood

140
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:29,360
out every single person said the same

141
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:32,400
thing

142
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:35,440
we need to hear more from developers

143
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,440
it makes so much sense

144
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,359
i mean none of us can be successful

145
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:43,440
really without that part

146
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:45,440
um it's hard to prioritize

147
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,600
uh what to ship and and the right thing

148
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,360
if you don't know what pain points are

149
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,520
and you can't get people to use

150
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:54,800
something unless it actually

151
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:56,719
solves one of their problems

152
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,560
so for all of those reasons we propose

153
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,880
the developer needs assessment so what

154
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,479
is that exactly

155
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,080
it's a prioritized list of developer and

156
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:05,520
designer needs

157
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,199
and it's a simple tool for harsh

158
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:10,080
prioritization

159
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:11,600
that's representing a diverse audience

160
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:15,039
and a pretty massive

161
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:16,800
feature space it's published on mdn

162
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:18,318
and it's not owned by a single browser

163
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:22,160
vendor

164
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:25,199
we initially proposed this on the mdn um

165
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,600
product advisory board uh because there

166
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:28,160
we have representation from

167
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,840
[Music]

168
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:33,360
major browser vendors but also from the

169
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:34,960
industry and from the w3c

170
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,560
because as a community we at least have

171
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,359
to have a common understanding of the

172
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,639
facts

173
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:43,360
even if you then decide to prioritize

174
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:43,360
different things

175
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,720
and finally it's reproduced annually and

176
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,000
this is really important because as an

177
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,039
industry we need to know whether we're

178
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,599
addressing

179
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:54,240
pain points of developers and whether we

180
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:55,919
are having

181
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,759
impact with the things that we're

182
00:06:55,919 --> 00:07:00,080
actually doing

183
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:01,120
so we so we need to track pain points

184
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,400
over time to see

185
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:05,120
where things are actually going and

186
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:08,560
whether we are really moving things in a

187
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:10,240
in the right direction and if you do as

188
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,599
well we think the mdn web developer

189
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,919
needs assessment or

190
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:15,120
mdm web dna for short it can be the

191
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:17,359
voice of developers and designers

192
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:19,599
working on the web today

193
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,120
and asking web developers and designers

194
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:24,159
about the frustrations is not

195
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:25,199
trivial uh because the the problem space

196
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,880
is just so vast

197
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:32,400
and the audience is very

198
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:33,680
diverse so let me tell you a little bit

199
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,560
about the process we went through for

200
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,240
that

201
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,160
and i apologize up front because i'm not

202
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,080
a user researcher we worked with a very

203
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,039
talented allison mckee from pinpoint

204
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,479
research on this

205
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:44,800
so i'm going to do my best to channel

206
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:47,199
her here

207
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:49,120
in january last year we started the

208
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,479
process by fielding a survey to our

209
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,720
product advisory board members

210
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:55,919
and we asked them for data that they

211
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:57,680
would use for decision making

212
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:59,198
we then had almost 20 in-depth

213
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,400
interviews with web developers and

214
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:02,560
designers

215
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:04,239
before we put the uh final survey

216
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,080
together and that is because we wanted

217
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,400
the survey to be rooted to be rooted in

218
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,878
the

219
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:10,239
in the voices of web developers if he

220
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:11,840
had started

221
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,800
from the questions that that browser

222
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:16,400
vendors had um

223
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,560
we would have been it would have been

224
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:21,120
based on the internal perspective

225
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,680
of browser vendors instead of instead of

226
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,840
really

227
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:27,840
being rooted in the everyday life of web

228
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,840
developers

229
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,880
so by conducting those interviews up

230
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,719
front we made sure

231
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,479
that we derived the questions from the

232
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:39,200
stories of developers and designers

233
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:40,479
about what is important to them

234
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,519
in their work on the web but also what's

235
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:43,519
frustrating for them

236
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:46,719
so to go from the interview findings to

237
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:49,600
the survey we followed pinpoint's

238
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:51,600
research process we went from

239
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:55,279
observations what we saw and heard

240
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,920
from web developers to insights what it

241
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:58,080
means

242
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,760
and then to critical themes why why

243
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:02,240
those actually matter

244
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:04,080
and we continue that process by

245
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,399
incorporating those survey findings into

246
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,680
the

247
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:09,360
survey results as well and in practice

248
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,719
that means we transcribed 16 hours of

249
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,440
interviews

250
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,160
we then coded them and finally bucketed

251
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,959
them to derive

252
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:18,480
insights for the items in our research

253
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:20,000
and that's a very hands-on approach as

254
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,000
you can see here

255
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,839
and based on these themes we constructed

256
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,519
the central survey questions around

257
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:26,959
uh the frustrations of web developers

258
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:28,720
and designers

259
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:30,640
and then we continued to work with our

260
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:33,920
product advisory board

261
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:37,120
um on the overall survey

262
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:38,399
we pilot we ran pilot um interviews

263
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,399
where we watched multiple people take

264
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:42,640
the survey just to make sure that it was

265
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:44,720
really uh understandable there was

266
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:47,040
nothing that people would misunderstand

267
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:51,120
um and to ensure that the story would be

268
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:52,800
as unambiguous as possible

269
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:55,120
and with the help of more than 30

270
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,000
stakeholders from our product advisory

271
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:59,279
board members

272
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,440
at um we

273
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:03,680
we put the final version version of the

274
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:06,640
survey together in july of last year

275
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:07,839
and we put it on mdn but it was also

276
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:11,279
fielded through

277
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:16,399
all product advisory members that's

278
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:18,720
the w3c google samsung goku microsoft

279
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:21,839
and not just in english we uh localize

280
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:24,399
the survey into eight languages

281
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:26,480
uh that's arabic simplified chinese

282
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:28,000
english french japanese korean brazilian

283
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,680
portuguese russian and spanish because

284
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,440
again it's a very diverse audience that

285
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,640
we're trying to address here

286
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,839
and i'm very happy to announce that

287
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,279
after fielding this review for four

288
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:38,880
weeks um

289
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:41,200
more than 76 000 people took us up on it

290
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:44,160
and more than 28 000 people took the

291
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:46,000
20 minutes to complete the full survey

292
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:48,240
and that's from 173

293
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,360
countries and just the complete

294
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,600
responses alone

295
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,200
that's more than 10 000 hours that the

296
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,480
communities essentially contributed to

297
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,680
let us know about

298
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,760
what their biggest pain points and

299
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,439
frustrations are

300
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,800
we believe that makes the mdm web dna

301
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,200
the biggest

302
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,160
web developer focused survey ever

303
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,480
conducted

304
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:08,480
and with that scale come benefits

305
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,399
because now we can segment the data by

306
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,320
experience level

307
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:13,519
by developer role country satisfaction

308
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,600
and we can still

309
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:16,959
retain very high confidence for the

310
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:20,000
results that we get from that

311
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:21,439
because the sample size is so large so

312
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,120
after this intro

313
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,760
uh you might be interested in actually

314
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,760
seeing results

315
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:31,120
so top countries uh as i mentioned we

316
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:33,200
had participation from 173 countries

317
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,800
across the globe but that's not

318
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:37,519
uniformly distributed

319
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:39,199
uh just six countries uh make up more

320
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:40,480
than half of the participants as you can

321
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,839
see here that's the

322
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:45,040
u.s china russia india germany and

323
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:46,800
france

324
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:48,079
and germany is a bit of a surprise

325
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,800
because we didn't even translate the

326
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:52,160
survey into

327
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:53,760
german that said

328
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:56,719
we still have pretty good representation

329
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:59,760
from europe asia and north america

330
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:02,000
um but we can do better

331
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,920
to reach developers in africa where we

332
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,320
had just two percent of the responses

333
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,319
this year

334
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:12,719
and one segmentation we were interested

335
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:14,560
in uh was developer type

336
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,720
and there is of course the classic

337
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:18,239
front-end back-end split

338
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,720
but recently people started talking

339
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:24,000
about the front of the front end

340
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,800
and the back of the front end there are

341
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,959
no

342
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:29,040
generally recognized terms for this uh

343
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:30,719
so if you ask people

344
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,319
are you on the back of the front end or

345
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,240
from the front of the back end they

346
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:37,680
don't really know what that means

347
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:39,760
uh so uh we asked whether people use

348
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:42,160
primarily javascript on the front end or

349
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:44,319
css and html and that's a bit of a proxy

350
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:46,560
for that

351
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:48,399
and respect and as expected given our

352
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,638
audience um

353
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:51,680
only a small number of participants saw

354
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:54,720
themselves as pure

355
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:56,638
back-end developers and we had to

356
00:12:54,720 --> 00:13:00,880
somewhat even split between javascript

357
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:02,399
and html css developers

358
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,920
but interestingly way more people

359
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:07,839
consider themselves

360
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:09,439
full stack developers

361
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:10,880
in terms of experience of course our

362
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:13,120
industry is growing

363
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:15,519
and it's growing at an incredible pace

364
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:17,360
so it shouldn't be too surprising

365
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:20,079
that one third of all participants had

366
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:23,279
less than three years of experience

367
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:26,239
and uh almost two-thirds of all the

368
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:29,920
participants in the survey had less than

369
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,920
five years or less experience

370
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:38,000
speaking about representation

371
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:40,800
so from previous surveys we are aware

372
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,120
um that we have to make a specific

373
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:47,519
effort

374
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:50,800
to get better general representation

375
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:51,839
um and we did uh we reached out

376
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,479
specifically to

377
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:56,320
uh to to groups to to get that but

378
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,600
unfortunately we didn't really succeed

379
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:00,959
with that goal

380
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:03,279
um women particip so

381
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:04,959
the participation of women uh you can

382
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:06,639
see here is

383
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:08,239
has a rate of about eight to twelve

384
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:09,600
percent

385
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,760
uh depending on which country you look

386
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:14,240
at and unfortunately

387
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:16,480
there are no global and general

388
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:19,360
population numbers but we know

389
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:20,800
that in the us at least the

390
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,160
participation rate of women

391
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,920
in software development is about 20

392
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,800
percent so that's what we're shooting

393
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:28,240
for

394
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,880
and um that is a clear bias of our

395
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,079
survey

396
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:32,000
and it's one that we want to better

397
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:33,359
account for in future interviews so for

398
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,079
now we want to at least acknowledge the

399
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,160
bias

400
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:37,199
and we want to ask everyone that they

401
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:39,519
consider

402
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:40,959
this bias when they make use of the

403
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:43,199
results when they interpret the results

404
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:43,199
here

405
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,560
all right that was the demographic

406
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:47,518
breakdown but what about the actual

407
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:50,959
results so

408
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:54,959
without further ado um here they are

409
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:58,800
all 28 uh from biggest frustration

410
00:14:54,959 --> 00:15:00,560
to the least frustrating thing

411
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:03,359
and i want to draw your attention to the

412
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:04,560
top five and the bottom five

413
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,560
and i'll go into a little bit more

414
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:09,599
detail in a moment about the top

415
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,599
five or top ten

416
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:14,320
but there are some surprises at first

417
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:17,360
glance when you look at the bottom five

418
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:19,920
here uh in particular making sites

419
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,920
accessible

420
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:25,040
so that's really important as we've just

421
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:28,560
heard about from iana

422
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:30,000
um but people who have worked on this

423
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:32,560
know that there are

424
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,560
many frustrations involved with actually

425
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:37,439
doing that work

426
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:38,560
so why is it ranked so low and this is

427
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,000
where the interviews really come in

428
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,959
handy because from our interviews we

429
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,600
know that people

430
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:46,000
a lot of people don't get to do that so

431
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:48,000
accessibility is often de-prioritized

432
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,839
so they might rank this low because not

433
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,839
because it's easy to do

434
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:53,440
but because most of the time they just

435
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:55,199
don't have the time to actually do it so

436
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:58,720
they never really encounter

437
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:58,719
the issues involved in that

438
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:02,399
and that example should make it clear

439
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,519
that context for this is really super

440
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:06,160
important

441
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:08,480
um this is a quantitative study you can

442
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:11,120
answer the question of

443
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,920
what and how many but it can't answer

444
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:15,040
the question

445
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:18,719
why and that's why we did the in-depth

446
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:21,120
interviews to really add that context

447
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,639
let's focus on the top 10 a bit more so

448
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:25,839
one thing you might have noticed

449
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:28,959
uh is that four out of the top five

450
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:30,240
items are in a similar bucket

451
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:32,959
it's web compatibility and

452
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:34,240
interoperability

453
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:36,319
uh one of the biggest strengths of the

454
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:38,880
web is that there is no single vendor

455
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:41,040
that controls the platform but that

456
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:42,399
doesn't come for free

457
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:44,240
web developers and designers are

458
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:44,959
frustrated by not being able to use

459
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,120
features

460
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:49,439
or by having to find workarounds

461
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:51,759
fiddling with browser differences

462
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:53,759
and by the difficulty to verify that

463
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:57,839
something that works in one browser

464
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:57,839
will also work in another browser

465
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:04,240
there is another bucket though it's less

466
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:06,000
clear-cut

467
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:08,640
but it also shouldn't be too surprising

468
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,520
because the web doesn't just consist of

469
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,480
javascript html and css it's the

470
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:15,119
ecosystem of

471
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:17,679
libraries and frameworks as well and

472
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:20,958
there is no

473
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:24,160
standard web library there is no one way

474
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:25,679
to build a web application that again

475
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:27,600
comes with upsides and some very

476
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:30,320
specific drawbacks

477
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:31,439
and those really manifest here in these

478
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,200
frustrations

479
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:36,559
documentation and sample code is almost

480
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:39,840
always the top priority for developers

481
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:41,918
and you can see that here it's in the

482
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:43,360
second position really

483
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:44,960
but handling multiple frameworks and

484
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:46,159
keeping up with the ever-changing

485
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,880
landscape

486
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:52,320
is also something that developers find

487
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,320
frustrating at a very high rate

488
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:57,039
i mentioned before that one of the big

489
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,479
benefit of having big numbers is that

490
00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:00,480
you can segment

491
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,760
uh and you can slice the data and still

492
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,960
get useful results

493
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:07,120
so here's one such segmentation

494
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:09,840
the top five frustrations between some

495
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:10,959
of the top countries in the survey

496
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:13,280
you'll notice that there is actually

497
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,400
very little variation between those

498
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,320
countries

499
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,440
and that's somewhat surprising because

500
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:20,639
these are

501
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:21,760
really different markets when you ask

502
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:25,520
web developers

503
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:25,520
yeah they're they have very similar

504
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:30,959
frustrations

505
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:33,120
and as you know the pace of change on

506
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,960
the web is incredible so we

507
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:36,719
asked people what the biggest barrier

508
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:39,760
for entry was

509
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:42,000
um when new tech when new technologies

510
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:44,160
become available

511
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,679
the results very much match the

512
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:48,799
frustrations we talked about earlier

513
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:52,000
it's interoperability

514
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:53,840
and documentation those are the leading

515
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,559
issues when it comes to why people

516
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:57,918
might not jump on some new tech so when

517
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:58,960
you're working on some new technology

518
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:02,400
and you want

519
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:04,480
developers to adopt it look at this it's

520
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,640
interoperability and documentation of

521
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,640
that

522
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:11,918
so far we've talked about what is

523
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:14,000
available and causing issues

524
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:15,520
but we were equally interested in uh

525
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,880
what it is that people felt was missing

526
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:18,639
from the web platform

527
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:20,080
so we asked the question what are the

528
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,200
things that you would like to be able to

529
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:23,600
do on the web

530
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,960
but like what web platform features to

531
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:28,000
do

532
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:29,520
and we had a massive long tail massive

533
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,760
long tail for wish list that you can see

534
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,760
here

535
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:37,360
that's represented by the other category

536
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:41,918
of things that have

537
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:41,918
less than two percent mentioned each

538
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:45,280
and on the other hand the biggest

539
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:48,720
category

540
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:51,760
by far is access to the underlying

541
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:54,880
devices so that's

542
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:56,640
usb bluetooth camera sms and all kinds

543
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:58,160
of sensors

544
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,919
and we broke out access to the file

545
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:02,159
system as its own category

546
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:04,400
as it's the biggest request within that

547
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:07,919
category and in a similar way

548
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:11,039
people uh want access to native apis

549
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:13,120
so that's contact lists calendars

550
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:15,679
and other features that the operating

551
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:17,280
system provides

552
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:18,720
and you will notice once again browser

553
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:21,360
compatibility

554
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:22,880
is very high on the wish list because

555
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:25,280
what good is a feature

556
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,799
if it's only implemented in one browser

557
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:30,240
and it doesn't reach that threshold of

558
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:30,240
availability and you cannot use it

559
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:37,120
so now this was a little bit bleak

560
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:38,640
so before we finish this i have some

561
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:40,080
good news

562
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,679
we wanted to have one measure that would

563
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:44,399
help us understand what the current

564
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:46,080
sentiment is among web developers

565
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,679
so we asked how would you rate your

566
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,960
overall satisfaction with the web as a

567
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:52,400
platform

568
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:55,440
and a set of tools to enable you

569
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:59,200
to build what you need or want

570
00:20:55,440 --> 00:21:02,000
and a full 76 percent

571
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:03,600
are either satisfied or very satisfied

572
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,640
and only nine percent

573
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:08,399
are dissatisfied or very dissatisfied so

574
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:13,200
while there is room to grow

575
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:15,039
the web is an amazing platform indeed

576
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,559
and by understanding what web developers

577
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:18,080
spend their time on

578
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:19,678
and identifying what their biggest

579
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:21,600
frustrations are

580
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:22,799
we can focus our intention on on those

581
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:25,280
and help make things

582
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:27,200
even better so next year when we do this

583
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:29,760
again hopefully the numbers will be up

584
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:31,360
which is i'm very happy that uh to share

585
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:33,120
that some

586
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:35,439
of the uh i'm very happy to share some

587
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:37,678
of the responses we got from

588
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:39,919
the browser vendors who were involved in

589
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:39,919
this

590
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:44,080
so google came out with a very strong

591
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,039
endorsement and i want to thank them for

592
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:47,199
that

593
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:48,559
they said the google web platform team

594
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,640
is now using developer satisfaction

595
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:52,799
that's one of our top level metrics

596
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:54,640
we're excited to be using the mdn dna as

597
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:56,240
one of the main sources of data

598
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:58,080
to help us understand and prioritize the

599
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,799
key areas of developer frustration and

600
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,559
they follow

601
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:02,320
they follow through the developer

602
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:03,440
satisfaction question that you've seen

603
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:05,360
before

604
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,559
it's really now a top level kpi that

605
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,678
they're using for this year and we're

606
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:10,480
looking into

607
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:12,559
how can we actually make this actionable

608
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:14,559
so we can move the needle on that

609
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:17,678
and we are looking at the top

610
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:19,120
frustrations for that one

611
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:23,600
we shared an earlier version of this

612
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:26,799
report at tpec in september

613
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:29,840
and it was very well received by the w3c

614
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:31,039
uh which makes me very hopeful so they

615
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,480
said that earlier reports from the

616
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:33,440
survey provide

617
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,799
valuable input to several

618
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,640
standardization and pre-standardization

619
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:38,879
discussions at w3c

620
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:40,480
beginning meeting that's the tpec and we

621
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,240
anticipate the published report will

622
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,200
continue to support senate's progress it

623
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,360
makes very helpful

624
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:47,600
hopeful to hear that from them not

625
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:49,120
surprisingly muslim is on board as well

626
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:51,039
on the firefox team we're always

627
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,760
listening to our community needs in

628
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:54,240
order to make

629
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:55,919
product decisions the comprehensive

630
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:58,159
overview of the developer community's

631
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:59,280
needs provided by the mdn web dna report

632
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:01,440
is therefore

633
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:03,360
essential to us and we're already

634
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:06,720
incorporating the findings in our plans

635
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:08,399
and you really are so

636
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,919
what i just presented and much more is

637
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,840
in the full report that was published at

638
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:13,280
the end of last year

639
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:16,240
and i want to thank all of the product

640
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:19,200
advisory board members for their support

641
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:21,679
and we really invite everyone here to

642
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:24,720
use the results to shape the

643
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:25,679
and to do that to better reflect what

644
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,960
developers

645
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:29,760
really need what their biggest pain

646
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:32,159
points are what their frustrations are

647
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:33,440
but as i said we want this to be an

648
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:36,159
annual

649
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:37,919
thing so the next iteration will

650
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:39,919
hopefully start in march

651
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:42,320
and we will feel to survey in may and

652
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:46,080
then publish the results in september

653
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:51,840
just in time for the next tpec and um

654
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:51,840
the 2021 planning season

655
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:56,240
and if you want to see see the full

656
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:59,520
report you can now download it

657
00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:01,600
from insights.developer.mozilla.com

658
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:03,279
and it's free it's very comprehensive

659
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:06,240
and you can pick the things that are

660
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:06,240
really important to you

661
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:11,279
that is it i'll just leave this up

662
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:15,919
and now we can take questions

663
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:17,679
[Applause]

664
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:19,120
we're quite early so 10 times for

665
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:20,880
questions yeah exactly

666
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:22,320
um so we have a plenty of time for

667
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:24,480
questions if you have questions you

668
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:27,360
raise your hand i'll give you the mic

669
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:28,159
so you can ask questions and it's

670
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,678
recorded

671
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:31,360
i'm going to start by the first stairs

672
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:33,279
so i don't have to walk too much

673
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:36,158
and then i'll go to the person that's on

674
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:36,159
the top afterwards

675
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:41,840
i was wondering if you've done anything

676
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,799
on a similar scale with actual users

677
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:44,799
because

678
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:46,158
for one of one of the things in there

679
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:47,679
from the results was developers want

680
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:49,919
more and more access to like hardware

681
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:51,440
can you speak up a little bit is that

682
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:53,440
better oh yeah

683
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:55,760
so i was wondering if you had done a

684
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:57,600
similar thing on a similar scale with

685
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,799
like end users who just use the browser

686
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,279
rather than developers because one of

687
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:01,039
the things

688
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:02,799
there was the developers want more

689
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:04,240
access to like hardware and user

690
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:05,918
computer information and things but that

691
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:07,039
could be totally opposite to what the

692
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:10,159
users want

693
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:12,000
yeah that's a really good question uh so

694
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:13,440
it's actually one of the verbatim quotes

695
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,080
that we have from a developer

696
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:17,360
who says as a developer i want access to

697
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:19,600
the hardware

698
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:20,479
and i want access to the sensors but as

699
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,399
a user

700
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:24,240
that sounds like a nightmare and i don't

701
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:26,080
want that at all so it's interesting

702
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:27,440
because even developers who really want

703
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:30,080
access to the hardware

704
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:31,200
are still horrified by the implications

705
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:34,559
of that

706
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,880
and um so yeah we know on the on the on

707
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:37,039
the

708
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:38,960
on the user side uh privacy is a big

709
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:39,679
concern there's a lot of research going

710
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,679
into that

711
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:43,440
uh met mozilla but also at other browser

712
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:45,760
vendors but when we look at

713
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:47,679
developers this is what they want to

714
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:49,120
actually build more things on the web

715
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:51,039
so i think it's on us to figure out how

716
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:52,158
to do that while still respecting the

717
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:54,559
privacy

718
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:56,000
of uh users i think there is there's

719
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:58,240
movement in that area

720
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,320
i think uh web media is one of the next

721
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:03,120
things that's that's coming in

722
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:03,678
web bluetooth web usb uh we're working

723
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,279
on that

724
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:07,840
there are still big barriers to it but

725
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:09,360
yeah it's something that

726
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:11,039
we know there is a there is an issue

727
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:14,000
with that there is a reason why we don't

728
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:16,879
have access to all of that yet

729
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,880
any other questions

730
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:27,600
no thank you

731
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:29,520
so i'll say it again if you're sitting

732
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:37,360
on the is please try to move to the

733
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:37,360
center so people
