1
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:17,840
so

2
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:18,960
hi i am sebastian rochette and i will

3
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,279
talk about you about

4
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,680
transforming scholar analysis into

5
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:27,599
documented reproducible and shareable

6
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:31,198
workflow this is um

7
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:33,760
feedback from uh conference that i

8
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:35,440
i did a few months ago so i will explain

9
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:38,800
what we did during this uh this

10
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:42,079
hackathon together to do that

11
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:44,239
so yeah i i'm working at the think r i

12
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:47,520
am a data scientist and

13
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:50,559
our expert and our trainer and you can

14
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,800
follow us if you want if you need and

15
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:53,760
everything is there also what i didn't

16
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,000
say is

17
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,920
this presentation is already on my

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,520
github so if you want to follow the pdf

19
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:03,039
you can you can find them

20
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:05,519
on my on my github account

21
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:07,439
so this collaboration fest was about the

22
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:10,240
air software so i'm not sure

23
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:11,279
that everybody knows air software but

24
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:14,000
it's a

25
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,360
software for doing data science and this

26
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,960
was in concarno

27
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:22,159
in france in brittany this nice

28
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,919
nice place and it was with different

29
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:27,439
researchers

30
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:29,439
in ecology mainly the aim of this

31
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:32,479
collaboration fest was to speak about

32
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:35,600
air so we were all here because of this

33
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:37,840
software and we had

34
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,960
three days together and the first part

35
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,280
was to

36
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,158
do some presentations about good

37
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,520
practices with

38
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:47,600
r so how to do packages and how to use

39
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:50,399
the git to work together

40
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:52,720
how to put all your packages and work

41
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:53,360
inside the docker container and to share

42
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,158
it

43
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,640
in a reproducible way and at the end you

44
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,280
could

45
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:01,680
also put that and learn how to work with

46
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,360
the galaxy

47
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,119
user interface which is a graphical

48
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:08,560
interface to to share your

49
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:11,840
your research work in uh to

50
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,480
to to the planet if you want um so we

51
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,680
had this

52
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:19,679
uh steps from the writing scripts

53
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:23,040
uh in the in a reproducible way

54
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:26,160
to the to sharing this packet

55
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:29,760
and to share it into a

56
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:33,920
a ui like like a docker and galaxy

57
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:36,560
and what we learned around that it was

58
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,518
about how to efficiently share your your

59
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,800
work

60
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:43,920
so base principles were made for data so

61
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,800
we already spoke this a few hours ago by

62
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,839
materials about

63
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:51,040
the fair principles which is findable

64
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:54,879
accessible interpretable and reusable

65
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:56,400
it's applied to data sets so findable it

66
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:58,879
means that you can find

67
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,680
where the data is or a computer can find

68
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:02,079
it

69
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,519
accessible is to say when you found the

70
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,080
data you know

71
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:06,640
how you can access the data this data

72
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,080
and

73
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:10,319
if you have to put a password on it it

74
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:14,400
should be written somewhere

75
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:17,040
interoperable it means that you can

76
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,400
use the data inside different workflows

77
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:21,599
so the

78
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,400
the the format of the the data can be

79
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:26,159
used

80
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:29,200
in uh in other in softwares or

81
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:32,319
some somewhere else and reusable

82
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:34,238
is more linked to reproducible is is

83
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:34,720
like you can use the data to combine

84
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:36,959
with

85
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:39,280
other data set but also you can

86
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:41,280
reproduce the data because you know how

87
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:44,000
the data was was built before

88
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,640
and if you want to add some new data to

89
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,440
do a

90
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,159
meta analysis for instance you have the

91
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:51,920
clues

92
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:53,280
of how to to go on on the field and to

93
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,879
add some new data to this and to

94
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,120
continue to work with this data

95
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:58,480
so this are the fair principle for

96
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,599
sharing data

97
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:03,518
and i think that to share the code and

98
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:06,399
to share the software that you have

99
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:06,879
you have we can use the same ideas

100
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,400
around

101
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:13,439
around fair for that so

102
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,560
i divided that in five categories not

103
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:17,599
only four

104
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:21,040
about uh accessibility so the same here

105
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:23,440
uh reproducibility documentation

106
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,800
readability and communication so i will

107
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:28,160
explain

108
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:31,280
uh in the different uh other slides um

109
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:35,199
what is what are these five steps

110
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:38,638
but uh we tried to to apply that

111
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:41,520
inside our um our group

112
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:42,400
in the hackathon to to to go from this

113
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:45,680
coding

114
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:49,359
to to share the work that you

115
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:52,880
you do but for researchers who only work

116
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:56,160
alone in their uh or with two people

117
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:58,080
in their in the research lab they are

118
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,800
only doing some coding you have

119
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:02,880
plenty of codes stored in your computer

120
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,600
and how do you share this plenty of

121
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,960
codes

122
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:09,600
math to to the community and how can you

123
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,960
do this in a in a way that the other can

124
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:14,000
use it again

125
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,479
so this is a big step and for for for

126
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,120
that

127
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:17,680
uh i would recommend to not stay alone

128
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,240
in front

129
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,520
of this big step and try to to go with

130
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:25,120
some friends because

131
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:27,520
alone is quite difficult so during this

132
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:30,240
hackathon we decided to work together

133
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:32,159
on a common project so one researcher

134
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,479
was here

135
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,680
with the project which is called vg kiro

136
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:39,360
it's a project

137
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:43,440
that look at the distribution of

138
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:46,160
this bats in in france so we have

139
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:48,080
some data about the distribution on the

140
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,880
observation of bats we have some data

141
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:52,400
about

142
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:56,479
environmental distribution temperature

143
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:59,599
whatever weather on in france and

144
00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:00,318
with this data they do some modeling to

145
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,440
try to

146
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:06,560
to model the distribution in france

147
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:07,360
so they have a workflow about about this

148
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,880
work

149
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,800
that they wanted to to share and

150
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,120
continue to work on it and for that they

151
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,560
have

152
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:16,479
a lot of uh r scripts so of course i

153
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:19,440
thought it was about war so if

154
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:20,240
this is about or so we decided to to

155
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:23,360
work

156
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:26,880
together um with the different uh

157
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:30,080
developers who were there to try to

158
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:33,759
to know how to share this kind of

159
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:34,240
work and how to apply the good practices

160
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:38,479
that we

161
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,479
that we presented the the day before

162
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:43,758
going back to these five steps um about

163
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:46,000
the accessibility

164
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:47,280
the work was already available on github

165
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,440
so the researchers

166
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:52,000
put all the script on github so you have

167
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:53,520
here on your part of the r script that

168
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,720
were available at the root

169
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:59,120
of the of the repository and

170
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,960
the big part is hidden inside the folder

171
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:04,400
that we wanted to hide because

172
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:06,239
it was too much for for us but at least

173
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,120
we had something to to work on and

174
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,199
everybody could

175
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,240
clone the github repository to have

176
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:11,919
access to this

177
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,000
r script and to to be able to work

178
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:17,520
together on that on that project so

179
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:21,199
the first point was already already okay

180
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:23,680
the main part of of this work

181
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:26,560
i mean the difficult part of this work

182
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:30,639
was maybe the management of the project

183
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:31,520
which means that um how to to teach to

184
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:34,160
people who never

185
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:36,240
use this kind of of tools and together

186
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:40,080
i'm into working in collaboration

187
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:43,680
to to go from this script to a a well uh

188
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:46,960
well usable uh piece of software

189
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:49,919
so first we had to dissect the work

190
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,878
so maybe you don't see it but here we

191
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:53,758
would take we took

192
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:55,120
a whiteboard to wrote all the functions

193
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:57,599
all the different parts of the

194
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:59,759
of the project and what this script does

195
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:01,840
what this script does and what this one

196
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:03,360
can we link them together is there

197
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:05,599
something that comes

198
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,400
at first that something had come at the

199
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:08,479
end

200
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,599
and what do we have between these

201
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:12,400
different steps

202
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:13,120
so here we we identified that between

203
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,840
the different

204
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:17,599
steps we could have some input data and

205
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,000
output data that can be used for the

206
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:22,000
next

207
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:25,360
the next step so um

208
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:29,520
the researcher had to to to show

209
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:32,560
us all his script and all the

210
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:36,079
and to to to be able to also give a an

211
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:39,039
image like this about his work

212
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:41,039
and it seemed to be easy for him to do

213
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:43,279
it but at the end when we asked him

214
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:45,279
how was it for him he said i felt

215
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:47,519
totally naked

216
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:50,240
to to present all my call to some

217
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:52,320
stranger some people i don't know i mean

218
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,680
it was easy for me to to share the code

219
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,000
on github because you don't know if

220
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,319
somebody

221
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,680
will see it or if they see it is on at

222
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,440
the other side of the planet so you

223
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:02,079
don't care but here you had

224
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,920
10 people looking at you say okay tell

225
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,720
me what you did and why do you put that

226
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:07,680
in there so

227
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,240
it's it's really difficult part but i

228
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,519
think that

229
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,080
um the the the people who were there

230
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:15,200
were

231
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:18,720
really welcoming and uh

232
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:21,760
and uh friendly uh which is kind of a

233
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:25,279
a particularly of the our community it

234
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:27,040
the our community is is made

235
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:28,640
i mean there are a lot of work that is

236
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:31,920
made into our community to

237
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:34,240
to be able to welcome anybody

238
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,439
uh whatever is your origin whatever is

239
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,519
your gender

240
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:40,080
there are maybe you heard about the old

241
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:43,200
ladies that inspired the pie ladies

242
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:45,920
it's some groups that uh help

243
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:47,360
putting in front of the of the of the

244
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:50,240
screen uh people

245
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,920
who are not usually seen like a white

246
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,440
men with a beard you know

247
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:55,199
you are not only white men doing some

248
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:58,160
code so there are other people so

249
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,560
the art community is very inclusive for

250
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:01,839
that

251
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:04,319
and i think that this this

252
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:06,399
thing that we have in mind uh helped us

253
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:09,040
also to to be uh friendly with

254
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:11,839
with this research on to to share the

255
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:14,079
work and to to work together

256
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,880
so we separated the work into small

257
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:18,079
pieces

258
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:20,320
and we opened issues on the

259
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:21,680
github repository to say this part of

260
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,079
the code does that

261
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:26,000
and i would like you or somebody to to

262
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:28,399
work on it to make it uh

263
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,279
to make it uh nicer or to to work on

264
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:31,600
this part

265
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:32,399
we dispatch the different issues between

266
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,920
one or

267
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:37,360
two developers and and so that anyone

268
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,199
could work on

269
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,720
his little part because here the

270
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:44,160
workflow was kind uh

271
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:47,440
quite easy as soon as we had some

272
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:48,800
data sets that were available to to do

273
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,800
the different parts

274
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,160
it was quite easy to say yeah you can

275
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,160
work on this small part because you have

276
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,279
some input data and you have some output

277
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:57,040
data you know

278
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:59,040
how to go from this point to the other

279
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:01,279
point

280
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,719
so this this section parts and then of

281
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:06,320
course you have to manage a re

282
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:08,800
repository on how you to present how

283
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:10,399
you cover collaborate on site inside a

284
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,640
git repository

285
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:13,839
how do you do you deal with a pull

286
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:16,000
request and

287
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:18,160
everything like this but i took this

288
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:22,959
part for the for this time

289
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:25,439
um so the the recipe i mean for this uh

290
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:26,160
work and how to to share this work is

291
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,680
first to

292
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:33,199
carefully peel back the code so we had

293
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:35,439
to identify uh inside the code

294
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,560
uh if there were some user specific

295
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,800
pieces i mean

296
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:41,680
if if inside your code you say yes this

297
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:43,359
data is on my computer at c dot dot my

298
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:46,560
document and settings on my name

299
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:48,720
nobody will be able to use it again so

300
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:50,399
you have to to go inside it and to find

301
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:53,200
all this part that could be

302
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:55,440
removed or at least be parameterized to

303
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:57,839
put it on the top of your script saying

304
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,720
this part you let the user define where

305
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:02,399
is the data

306
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:06,160
on his own computer and you can also cut

307
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:08,320
the different bit code into small pieces

308
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:10,240
so that it's easier to to to maintain or

309
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:13,040
to see the goal of the different

310
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:15,360
the different parts with the r software

311
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:17,279
everything is about functions so a

312
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,480
function is you take something in input

313
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:21,680
and you have one thing and

314
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:23,519
as output so the parameterization

315
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,719
is like the parameters of of the

316
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:27,760
function

317
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:30,720
so we had to put a different

318
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,760
script as a function or a smaller

319
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,760
function

320
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,839
and we use what we call replex

321
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,720
reproducible example this is the word

322
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:39,920
that

323
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:41,839
would use to use in in aura is

324
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:44,719
you have one function so you have to

325
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:47,440
show a small data set that can enter it

326
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,720
and show what is the output of that and

327
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:51,040
anyone

328
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,399
that that use this small data set and

329
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:55,439
use the same function

330
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:57,279
should have the same output

331
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,680
without having to have the big data set

332
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:01,839
that you use for the entire analysis

333
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,959
and if you are comfortable enough of

334
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:06,240
course you can add some

335
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:08,079
unit tests on these functions but maybe

336
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:11,200
it can be later if you just start to

337
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:13,120
learn how to breathe a function

338
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,880
so the first part of the recipe the

339
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:18,000
second part is document

340
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:21,839
generously we already spoke about

341
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:24,160
notebooks so in r we have this

342
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:26,079
notebooks that we call vignettes it's

343
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,760
done with markdown 2.

344
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:30,479
it's like the jupiter notebook but for

345
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:33,760
for art or or macdon

346
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:36,959
and it it allows to to

347
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:37,760
mix some uh plain text documentation

348
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:40,800
with some

349
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:42,639
r code that will be executed during the

350
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:46,160
process of of building the

351
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:49,360
of building the the package here and and

352
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:51,680
um so that it's also reproducible if you

353
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:54,000
give the same notebook and gives to

354
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:57,199
somebody else to compile this notebook

355
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,600
it should be self-contained and anyone

356
00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:00,160
can

357
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,760
reproduce the different example on it so

358
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:03,680
in this notebook you put some also

359
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:05,279
reproducible examples but

360
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,800
because you did some reproducible

361
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:08,800
examples for the functions

362
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:10,800
you can reuse them to show how this

363
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,079
function works and why they work this

364
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:15,199
way

365
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:17,279
and in r as soon as you build a function

366
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:19,599
you have to document the function too so

367
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:20,399
say what does this function what are the

368
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,040
parameters and

369
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:25,199
what do you put in this parameter is it

370
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:28,719
numeric is it text whatever

371
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:32,639
and what are the dependencies needed

372
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:35,839
to to to use this uh this function

373
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:36,160
so indeed when we do that we transform

374
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:39,680
the

375
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:40,800
the the package of the lots of scripts

376
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:43,519
in into

377
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:44,079
our package because the structure of

378
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:46,639
having

379
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:47,920
vignettes of having documentation for

380
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:50,480
function and putting

381
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:51,279
the function in in a specific directory

382
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,839
inside your

383
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:54,320
your big directory is called the package

384
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:57,360
and this

385
00:14:54,320 --> 00:15:02,880
is uh forced by the art community to

386
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:02,880
to to document completely this package

387
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:10,399
so from there we had built

388
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:12,000
a small package and of course we had to

389
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:14,079
each others continue to develop the

390
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,720
different parts

391
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:18,560
after that you have to add you can add

392
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:21,839
the right amount of readability

393
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:24,239
um for me or is a

394
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:26,720
is not a minified language so it's not

395
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,600
like javascript you can put a lot of air

396
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:30,000
inside and

397
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:32,240
when you put some air you can breathe

398
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,560
when you read your code and

399
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,279
you have to think about future you in

400
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,959
six months

401
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:38,480
will totally have forgot what you put

402
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:39,359
inside your code and if you can read

403
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:42,079
your code

404
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,880
like you read a book it's easier to to

405
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:45,439
go back

406
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:46,320
inside there are in there or community

407
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,800
some

408
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,920
some packages like the in the thai

409
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:53,519
diverse

410
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:55,920
who who also give some

411
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:56,800
functions that are readable and the code

412
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:59,439
can be

413
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:00,079
read by anyone even if you don't

414
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,160
understand

415
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:04,880
the oracle you can unders i mean if even

416
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,880
if you did never

417
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:08,239
developed in or you can understand the

418
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:10,000
code because the names of

419
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:12,000
the function and the way you you write

420
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,480
it is readable

421
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,480
by anyone like an english text of course

422
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:19,279
you need to speak english once

423
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:21,120
and so think about future you and think

424
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:21,920
about also about the other developers

425
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,360
will

426
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,800
will help you because if you want to

427
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:27,759
share to the community of course people

428
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:30,800
will give you some feedbacks on it

429
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:33,519
and the last part is communicate

430
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:35,680
abundantly about your work there are

431
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:37,519
many different ways to communicate about

432
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:39,279
it you know social media i'm sure

433
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:40,720
everybody of you have a smartphone or

434
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:43,759
almost some

435
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:46,320
you can do some blog posts about the

436
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:47,360
about what you did and indeed at the end

437
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,839
of this uh

438
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:51,279
of this acaton i i wrote a blog post

439
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:54,560
this one is in french

440
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:57,199
but the blog post what was to present

441
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,599
what i present here today so what we did

442
00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:00,319
to

443
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,880
to to go from this small script to a

444
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:04,240
shared

445
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:05,439
sharable package and it was also a way

446
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,599
for me to add

447
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:08,480
um a little more information for the

448
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:10,159
developers

449
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,559
because at the end of these days they

450
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:15,600
are let alone with their code and then

451
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:18,799
nobody's here to help them anymore so

452
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:21,119
at least i add some some clues inside

453
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:24,559
this blog plus to help them continue and

454
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:25,599
the the the work alone and you can also

455
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:28,720
build the website

456
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:29,199
and uh um something that is interesting

457
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:32,000
in the

458
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:33,440
with the r and the r package is this

459
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,640
package is plugin which is called

460
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:37,039
package down

461
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:39,280
and with this package done with one line

462
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:39,919
of code you can build a website from

463
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:43,280
your

464
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:45,520
or package so it uses all the

465
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:47,520
the different documentation parts you

466
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,240
haven't you have put inside the package

467
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:51,760
to show it

468
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:52,799
as a web page and if you combine your

469
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:55,760
github with

470
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:56,160
ci with a continuous integration this

471
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,000
this

472
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:00,080
website is built each time you put a

473
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:03,360
comment on git

474
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:05,360
so this is the website that is built

475
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:06,879
from the repositories that we built so

476
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:08,959
we have the first

477
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,559
page which is the readme that you have

478
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,840
in the github repository

479
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:13,918
you have a second page which is the

480
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,360
references which is the list of all

481
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:16,960
functions that are available

482
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,799
inside the the package and with the

483
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,200
documentation of the function how to use

484
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:22,720
them

485
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:26,720
with examples inside and you have

486
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:29,120
the articles you have the article part

487
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:30,000
which is the part where you have the

488
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:34,000
vignettes so

489
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,000
all the notebooks uh inside

490
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:38,559
so the feedback i have from from this

491
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:41,918
experience

492
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:42,639
is that for this kind of researcher who

493
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:45,840
only

494
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:48,559
worked alone in the lab um

495
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:49,678
the mentoring of this project was a good

496
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:52,320
start for them because

497
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:53,200
they would never go alone in this in in

498
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:55,520
this project

499
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,880
i mean at first when i presented what

500
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,799
they could do with the script and go

501
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,160
into the to the package and to to show

502
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:02,240
the website they were

503
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:04,320
okay but where do i start i will never

504
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:06,240
do that alone that's why we decided to

505
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,639
to choose one of their project to say

506
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,640
okay

507
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:10,000
let's do it together and let's see how

508
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:13,520
it works and how you could do

509
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:16,320
it as a researcher who present the work

510
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:19,840
you have to accept the exposure i mean

511
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:23,200
as i said it's not easy to to present to

512
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:25,199
to um to to people you don't know

513
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:27,360
your work and what is really inside your

514
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:29,840
code and to have to explain to people

515
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:31,439
in front of them yes here i did this

516
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:33,678
because i thought that this was

517
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:37,679
interesting but yes you have another

518
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:39,600
another way of doing it so let's go so

519
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:41,440
you also need a welcoming community

520
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:43,280
because you don't you cannot say yeah i

521
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,840
do not cut the same way that you could

522
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:46,000
so

523
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:48,320
let's break it everything that you did

524
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,640
and i will record it my way but then the

525
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,039
the

526
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:52,000
the researcher will be alone in front of

527
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:53,280
the escape that he doesn't

528
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,760
understand and cannot continue to

529
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:59,678
maintain so you also have to be

530
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:59,679
um to be um

531
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:04,559
welcoming to to to accept uh as the

532
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,480
helper that you can help but

533
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:08,240
help the way the other researchers

534
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,960
understand so

535
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,919
this is important to be in such a kind

536
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:15,520
of a

537
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:17,919
group so at the end the researcher will

538
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:19,600
change his practices and this is for

539
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:21,440
good because

540
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:23,678
as soon as you know the entire process

541
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:27,039
and you did it together

542
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:29,280
you can you can you can apply this

543
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:31,280
every time you do a new code you say

544
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:32,879
okay i have to think when i do my code

545
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:34,480
that i will do it this way because the

546
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,000
documentation is important and at the

547
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,480
end i would like this website that is

548
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,039
nice

549
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:40,400
to share to everybody so so this is

550
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:43,760
important but

551
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:44,640
the the thing that was almost missing is

552
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:47,600
the follow-up

553
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:48,559
because i only wrote this small blog

554
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:51,760
post and then

555
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:54,000
i just go back home and i continue to

556
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:55,280
to to speak to with them by email but

557
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,520
it's not the same than being here and

558
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:59,440
helping them on their own code so

559
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:01,120
maybe we can find some other way to to

560
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:04,240
collaborate

561
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:06,639
so transforming scatter analysis to

562
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,360
a shareable workflow is accessible to

563
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,600
people

564
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:11,120
with a little uh help to start but as

565
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,520
soon as you know how it works you can do

566
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:14,559
it

567
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:16,000
alone and continue as you wish and i

568
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:19,360
would recommend for

569
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:21,360
anyone either it's for or or any

570
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:22,719
any other language start with the

571
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,959
documentation

572
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:26,640
because you have the thing in mind you

573
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,400
know what this function or what this

574
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,559
part will do so write it

575
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:32,400
not keep it in your mind and as soon as

576
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:33,918
is it's if it's written

577
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:36,080
you can say oh yes my function is

578
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:36,559
written and i can share directly it

579
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:39,039
because

580
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:39,840
i already wrote the documentation so so

581
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:42,879
it will be

582
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:44,360
easier for you for the for your future

583
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:52,000
thank you very much

584
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:54,879
[Applause]

585
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,400
so two questions that are maybe linked

586
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,200
can you say a few more words about

587
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:00,240
reprax

588
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:02,400
which i don't know and

589
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:04,400
the following question is you don't

590
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:08,320
mention in your

591
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:12,799
guidelines for reproducibility

592
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:14,720
test driven documentation

593
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:15,840
yeah so the first question about what is

594
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:17,840
a replace

595
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:20,080
uh it's it's a construction of

596
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:22,639
reproducible example

597
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:23,760
okay there is a package in r which is

598
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,360
called replex which

599
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:27,520
helps you to do some reproducible

600
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:29,199
examples so the reproducible example is

601
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:31,760
that

602
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:33,039
you have a data set and you do i don't

603
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,480
know a model on it

604
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:36,720
and you have some outputs but the data

605
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:38,640
set is very big and

606
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,840
you need to spend two hours to have the

607
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,760
the outputs

608
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:43,678
if you want to somebody to help you to

609
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:46,559
debug this function you will not give

610
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:48,720
the big data set so the reproducible

611
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:49,840
example is like the smallest example you

612
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,799
can

613
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:54,000
prepare so that the people can reproduce

614
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:57,280
the output from the small

615
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,240
input and can reproduce also the the

616
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,520
errors

617
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:01,520
and the warnings that you have in your

618
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,960
function so that you can also yeah i can

619
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:04,639
reproduce it in few seconds

620
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:06,640
you give me this small power of code and

621
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:09,840
then i can help you to debug this

622
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,840
this is a reproducible example

623
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:16,720
i didn't spoke about

624
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:17,280
test driven development i think test

625
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:21,440
different

626
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:23,678
development is can be problematic

627
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:25,120
it's you have to be very careful about

628
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:27,600
that because

629
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:28,239
you can think okay um before writing my

630
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:32,158
function

631
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:34,559
i write what should look like the output

632
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:35,200
this is this part is interesting but if

633
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:38,639
you

634
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:42,000
put a lot of tests you will um

635
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:42,799
you will write your function as you want

636
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,720
the test

637
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:48,960
uh to be passed but maybe not i mean

638
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:50,640
i'm not sure i can really explain it in

639
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:53,039
a few words but

640
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,919
it's quite dangerous to do that it's

641
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:56,960
like

642
00:23:53,919 --> 00:24:00,080
it's like you go in at school and say

643
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:00,400
i would like my students to be very good

644
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,080
at

645
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:03,679
addition because they will be tested in

646
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,879
addition so you don't teach

647
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:06,559
multiplication and you don't teach

648
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,919
division you spend a lot of time on

649
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:10,879
additions and then the end

650
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:12,000
yes they have 100 percent of success but

651
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,440
what about the rest

652
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,279
was it also important that you didn't

653
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:17,440
think about that so this different

654
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:20,080
development can be

655
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,080
trippy like this

656
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:27,279
yeah just one comment on the student

657
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:29,600
development

658
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:31,200
there is a really good book about it and

659
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,799
it's

660
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,400
it's part of the development process

661
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:36,000
that you adjust your tests

662
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:37,840
continuously so it's an interactive

663
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,240
process you write the first version

664
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:41,918
implement the function and go to the

665
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:45,039
next level so

666
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:46,000
um coming up front with a really complex

667
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:48,640
test

668
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:51,520
is first of all really hard i would say

669
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:54,960
and not necessarily

670
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:55,600
straightforward so um a little bit

671
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,679
disagree

672
00:24:55,600 --> 00:25:00,639
what you said and kind of agree that

673
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:00,640
it's a good process

674
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:05,279
yeah so you think that you say that the

675
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:08,240
test driven development is

676
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:08,240
iterative process

677
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:12,320
when i i imagine test different

678
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:14,400
development is like

679
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:15,918
you write the tests you want to have and

680
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,559
then you write the function to to be

681
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:18,880
able to

682
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:19,918
to success in this test but the

683
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:22,000
iterative process

684
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:23,760
of course exists because you use the

685
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,440
function and at some point

686
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:27,520
you will have some new data sets and the

687
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:29,520
function will not work

688
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,559
so the the test you will you will say

689
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:33,120
okay this

690
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:34,158
should work so you write the test like i

691
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:36,559
would like

692
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:37,360
the output of this uh this process to

693
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:39,120
work

694
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:41,199
and then you add the new test in your

695
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:42,479
code so that the next time you see this

696
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:44,240
function so you correct the code of

697
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:46,640
course and the next time you

698
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,679
you you use this function you make sure

699
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:50,640
that it will work

700
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:51,279
so the test is also here to verify that

701
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,799
when you

702
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:55,039
change the versions of your code when

703
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:57,520
you modify different parts

704
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:58,158
in other places of your software that

705
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:01,039
the test

706
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:02,640
still pass because you you you are you

707
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:05,200
verify that

708
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:06,159
all the different kind of data you used

709
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,240
continue to work

710
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:09,600
this is the iterative part but for me

711
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:11,200
it's not what i i call

712
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:25,840
just driven development but maybe it's

713
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:25,840
just a semantic thing

714
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,600
you
