1
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:09,040
all right

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:12,160
thanks everybody for coming to the legal

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:14,799
and policy dev room

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:16,240
we look at all the hardcore fans that

5
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:17,919
are stayed in the audience because like

6
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:18,380
we filled up yeah thank you for being

7
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,520
here

8
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:23,519
[Applause]

9
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:24,720
like the van talk was the only thing we

10
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:26,959
were full for today

11
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,919
but i actually had to flip the sign uh

12
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,560
to the full

13
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,920
setting uh but we're not full now i

14
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,320
think that's obvious but we are

15
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:37,920
so thankful for those of you that stayed

16
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,920
just to hear us at the final session

17
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:41,760
so i think we should we did a lot of new

18
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,399
things that were one

19
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,599
major new thing this year um and so if

20
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:47,920
it's okay by everybody

21
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,039
i think we should start out with

22
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,640
feedback on that

23
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:54,399
so debates did you like them did you

24
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,640
let's start with let's start wait let's

25
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:59,840
start with hands so raise your hand

26
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,840
if you really liked them

27
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,680
it's not it's like three quarters okay

28
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:07,518
well at least it'd be easier to do this

29
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:07,519
raise your hand if you really hated them

30
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,560
okay so two people really hated them you

31
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,640
didn't even have to do

32
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,680
any fun times not sure whether you like

33
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,920
raise your hand you're not sure if

34
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,360
you're like him or not

35
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,280
okay then if you're not for people are

36
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:23,280
not sure it's about a quarter um and

37
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:26,560
then raise your hand if you really liked

38
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:30,159
some but you really disliked others

39
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:32,159
okay okay so so uh i think

40
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:33,439
in full disclosure we this was a real

41
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,200
experiment so

42
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:37,679
we didn't know exactly how to organize

43
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:40,159
them i think we learned a lot

44
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,600
um and we can see what works i spent the

45
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:42,880
entire day yesterday studying debate

46
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:46,399
theory

47
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:48,798
so so i think with the

48
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:50,720
with the assertion that the vast

49
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:54,479
majority of the people in the room

50
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:57,280
really liked them a lot or

51
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:58,960
really like some of them um maybe we

52
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,799
could go to the negative and have people

53
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,759
give constructive feedback on what they

54
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:03,119
would do

55
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:06,000
sure and then why don't we trade mike's

56
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:08,399
and i'll let people ask questions

57
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,840
is that what you're asking for now yeah

58
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,200
yeah that sounds great then i don't have

59
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,440
to run around with it okay i

60
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,720
see a raised hand and i have something

61
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,959
that um

62
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,319
a comment that was made on social media

63
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:23,840
that i can read as well

64
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:23,839
that was in the negative so

65
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,440
i i like the format but there were

66
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,800
possibly too many of them

67
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,640
so it sort of got a little repetitive

68
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,080
because the format was the same again

69
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,839
and again and again so

70
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:37,840
uh yeah i wouldn't run as many again but

71
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,840
i'd definitely do them again

72
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:46,160
i feel like this sort of scratched an

73
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:46,959
itch for a lot of people because a lot

74
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,760
of people

75
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:52,000
want to debate after talk often and so

76
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:54,079
this kind of solved that in a part

77
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,800
but i think yeah probably went a bit too

78
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:59,440
much in the other direction so a mix of

79
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,879
a few debates and a few talks and and

80
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,000
kind of on different subjects that would

81
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:04,640
be great but i love

82
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,599
the concept of some debate happening

83
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,879
here and not

84
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:12,000
like in the hallway okay you

85
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:12,000
you then

86
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,239
so i i think the debates were very

87
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,560
entertaining but

88
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:19,840
um there was i think there's kind of a

89
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:23,599
problem that

90
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:26,080
uh since the folks who participated

91
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:27,200
are more on one side of the debate

92
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,159
actually

93
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:32,000
than the when when there's a need to

94
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:35,120
represent the other side it sort of

95
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,720
becomes a caricature so it would be

96
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:39,680
maybe useful to

97
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,400
have actual proponents of the other side

98
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,640
participate

99
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,640
although it's kind of also a problem to

100
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,159
sort of invite them to the lion's den to

101
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,319
be like

102
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:49,760
yeah we really appreciate that uh to be

103
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:51,280
very frank about it uh

104
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,200
there was a tremendous amount of effort

105
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,879
done primarily by tom i actually uh want

106
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,359
to take a moment to ask will somebody

107
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:58,560
else

108
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,439
mike run for us for this session so tom

109
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,680
can

110
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:02,959
be up here with us okay he's he said i'm

111
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,480
just going to act but uh

112
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:06,640
but just give me a second kate i'll

113
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,399
finish that other point so so yeah we we

114
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,359
spent a tremendous amount of effort

115
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,439
emailing people

116
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,959
begging them to be in the baits begging

117
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:14,799
them to be on various sides we reached

118
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:16,399
out to people who are on various sides

119
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:18,478
and we had we had a hard time filling

120
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:20,638
some of them uh on certain sides

121
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:22,320
just a quick question raise your hand if

122
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:24,880
you didn't participate in a debate but

123
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:28,639
you totally would in the future

124
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:32,639
so like two four six seven

125
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:32,639
eight okay nine

126
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,960
um yeah i just wanted to um echo the

127
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,919
prior point

128
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,599
it would have been better if there was

129
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:40,240
something more sincerely debating each

130
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,400
side

131
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,600
as opposed to people putting on a

132
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,120
persona and then putting these big

133
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,040
disclaimers up

134
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,800
we'll probably learn more i want to read

135
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,240
the negative feedback that we got on

136
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,080
uh social media just because i think it

137
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,320
dovetails with it which is just dislike

138
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:57,599
new debate format of the legal policy

139
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:59,440
room at fosdem informative sessions uh

140
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,240
with respect to less sensational things

141
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,000
going on

142
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,680
in legal and policy and foss were placed

143
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,360
with rehashed conversations we've been

144
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,720
having for months for entertainment

145
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,960
glad my legal team isn't here would

146
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:12,320
waste their time so can i

147
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:14,080
say something um so i i happen i don't

148
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:16,080
agree with that comment but i do think

149
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:18,240
that that um

150
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,680
i felt that there was too much you know

151
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,080
this was good entertainment

152
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,600
but i um what i originally loved about

153
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:26,000
this dev room was the

154
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,520
more serious discussion of legal and

155
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,759
policy issues

156
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,599
and um this was as someone said you know

157
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:34,000
it kind of at times verged on

158
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,720
caricature and i see how it's sort of

159
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,039
fun

160
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:41,600
but um to me um i mean i'll just like

161
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:42,400
state some some other problems i had um

162
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,919
i thought that

163
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,840
um i think the format is somewhat

164
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:47,359
exclusionary because i think only

165
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,198
certain types of personalities are going

166
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,360
to be likely to enjoy

167
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:53,120
doing this kind of thing and be good at

168
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,479
it and so i think it's kind of much more

169
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,639
exclusionary than

170
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:58,719
than general um presentations are which

171
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:00,400
are exclusionary enough already and i

172
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:03,600
think that's something that should be

173
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:05,679
born in mind and one of the reasons we

174
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,880
did this is because we looked at the

175
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,919
last few years

176
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:13,520
of the uh of the dev room

177
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:16,000
talks and we get the we get

178
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,880
rehashed recycled submissions of the

179
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,600
same

180
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:21,680
thing every single year from the usual

181
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,560
suspects and we do a lot of effort to

182
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,840
get the cfp

183
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:27,199
to new places and cfp has like way too

184
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,799
much text because i wrote it

185
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:30,400
like paragraphs saying like we want

186
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,400
people who haven't talked about policy

187
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,679
before please submit et cetera et cetera

188
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,758
but we haven't been getting that the

189
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,520
last few years and so we didn't want to

190
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:39,520
just run the usual suspects giving all

191
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:42,719
the same talks for yet another year and

192
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,719
that's why we did it this way

193
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:47,599
that's true but i wrote the i i did not

194
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:50,319
write that alone but i wrote the

195
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,360
uh the i wrote the the the two verbros

196
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:53,120
stuff that's what i did

197
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,639
one point um i think a lot of the

198
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,240
participants were what we would call

199
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:57,919
usual suspects that's one of the

200
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,599
problems so i'm glad that there are some

201
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:02,639
people who are willing to

202
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:05,199
um maybe do debates debates um in

203
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:06,880
you know future years um so if we get

204
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:07,440
you know additional people to do it who

205
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,800
haven't

206
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,319
spoken in the dev room before i think

207
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,520
that'd be great but i think that there

208
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:13,280
were a lot of i mean

209
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,719
uh speakers that we really like but but

210
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:17,119
they're as bradley would

211
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,000
say usual suspects yeah i mean i think

212
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,759
that

213
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,680
it's being a first year proposition that

214
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:23,039
might happen but go ahead pam yeah so i

215
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,720
was going to say and i'm saying this

216
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:25,840
with my open source initiative board

217
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,160
member hat on

218
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,960
that um as we shared privately i'll say

219
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:32,639
publicly

220
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:34,318
that it was very um difficult it was

221
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:34,720
very difficult for the osi to sort of

222
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:37,919
see

223
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,400
our see our our mission sort of up for

224
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:40,400
vote

225
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,479
first off with with a very click-baity

226
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:44,799
title that was negative towards us

227
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:46,080
and then and then as first conveyed to

228
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,840
us that there was going to be sort of a

229
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,800
vote on whether or not the open source

230
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,719
definition

231
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,160
is appropriate or not which i i just

232
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,400
can't tell you how much angst

233
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,840
that that created at the osi that that

234
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,280
so it's maybe less

235
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,719
clickbait i appreciate that you didn't

236
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,520
ask those questions i appreciate very

237
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,319
much that if

238
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:04,159
and i did like the questions you did ask

239
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:06,639
was did you learn something did you

240
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:08,560
i think those were appropriate but um

241
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:11,440
less click-baity titles or or

242
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,800
sort of hanging people out to dry less

243
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:15,199
on the titles would

244
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:17,440
uh we would have appreciated that yeah

245
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:21,039
so what we had this year was like a

246
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:23,280
mix of some we did the general call

247
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:24,479
like cfp for folks that would want to

248
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:27,119
submit the debates

249
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:27,919
and then we also created some of them

250
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,240
and i think

251
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:30,960
um i think we would have a heavier hand

252
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,680
in

253
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,559
um in constructing those in the future

254
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:37,838
and

255
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:40,079
for many reasons including that um

256
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:41,760
so just actually building on kate's

257
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,399
comment from before that

258
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:45,600
it's maybe preferable to have people who

259
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:48,480
are actually taking

260
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:50,480
not sorry not just taking an opinion for

261
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:53,040
the sake of having a debate but

262
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,560
actually hold that opinion as well um i

263
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,719
think the advantage of

264
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,640
having it this way and actually putting

265
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:01,680
or forcing people to take

266
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:04,160
a specific um position

267
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:05,680
makes the debate less heated because

268
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,040
sometimes it feels like if you have

269
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:09,839
someone on the

270
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:11,839
on the panel who's actually holding an a

271
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:13,200
very controversial opinion

272
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:15,920
they will get attacked and it will

273
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,800
really go to go into that and you you

274
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:19,599
lose focus

275
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,959
of the topic as such so yes i understand

276
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:24,000
this is kind of a you know

277
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:26,319
it turns into a caricature maybe

278
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,360
but it also has the advantage of

279
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,120
allowing a debate

280
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,120
about it what if the topics were more

281
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:34,320
subtle

282
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,200
um yes i would have preferred that as

283
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,640
well

284
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,480
for some of them i think i would have

285
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:41,760
preferred them to be

286
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:43,040
clearer um on what you know what you're

287
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,080
actually talking about and what the

288
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:47,519
debate

289
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:48,480
is going to be about but yeah that's not

290
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,560
that's not

291
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,640
a format issue that's more of a like a

292
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:54,640
phrasing issue

293
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:56,000
yeah we actually originally wanted to

294
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:58,160
structure it going even further

295
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,240
in a very traditional way that they do

296
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:02,640
debates where you don't know what

297
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,079
side you have to take it's a coin flip

298
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:06,560
which is how debate tournaments usually

299
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:07,920
run you're given a policy issue and

300
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,359
you're told what the policies you had

301
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,560
but not which side you have to take and

302
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,680
then the coin is flipped at the

303
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:14,640
beginning and

304
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:16,239
that's how you end up on either side um

305
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:18,319
basically we couldn't get anybody to

306
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:21,200
agree to that who was willing to space

307
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,480
so if if people could pass the mic

308
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,920
around and tom you could come up because

309
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,279
i feel like so you can keep the mic

310
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,279
where it is and we'll pass it around but

311
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:33,040
tommy you're not participating in the

312
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:35,200
this is yeah so you can keep

313
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:37,279
um so this kind of relates to what

314
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,079
miriam was saying and probably also outs

315
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:40,800
me as

316
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:41,439
being my first time in the legal dev

317
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,599
room

318
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,720
um but what i was thinking about was

319
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,959
there seems to be

320
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,160
um too much of an assumption of a base

321
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:51,920
level of knowledge

322
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:54,079
on in two different ways one is

323
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,920
i had no idea what people were debating

324
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:57,920
about at times because the debate topic

325
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,680
wasn't clearly well defined and that i

326
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,000
would click on the description and the

327
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,479
page

328
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,839
and i'm like this doesn't sound right it

329
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,120
sounds like people are actually talking

330
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:07,360
about two different things

331
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,480
but something else is that the people in

332
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,560
the audience

333
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,760
i got this impression earlier when

334
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,079
somebody said you know

335
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,439
what are the four freedoms for example

336
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:18,319
and i'm lucky that

337
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:19,760
i know some of this stuff but being

338
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,440
somebody who has been out

339
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,959
of the open source movement for a long

340
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,360
time and coming back

341
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:26,399
you know i'm like oh i actually haven't

342
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,279
thought about a lot of this stuff for a

343
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:28,880
long time and

344
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:31,600
all this really assumes a very high

345
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:34,320
level of knowledge and it prevents

346
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:36,320
a lot of audience members i think i i

347
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:39,920
can speak for a lot of other people

348
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:41,519
i'm assuming um it prevents us from

349
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:43,680
being able to engage really

350
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:45,279
because i have no idea what you're

351
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:48,479
talking about sometimes

352
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:51,839
i think it's a really fair criticism we

353
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:54,160
have kind of

354
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:54,959
maybe enjoyed a lot of success in the

355
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,920
dev room and

356
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:58,959
by having a lot of legal geeks and

357
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:02,000
policy

358
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:03,839
people involved that you know

359
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,200
really go deep on this but what we

360
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:07,760
missed i think and

361
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,120
very much to your point is that it's all

362
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:11,200
we kind of

363
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,959
make out we have especially today i can

364
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,760
tell from not just your question but

365
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:15,920
many questions

366
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:18,399
uh that we're we have made a whole bunch

367
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:21,599
of assumptions about

368
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:22,320
uh a lot of things not just how

369
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,800
copyright

370
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,000
law in particular works but also some of

371
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,920
the

372
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,040
the decisions that have been happening

373
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:31,120
that are influential

374
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,639
and kind of how it will affect us and

375
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,760
some of us you know think about this a

376
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:37,200
lot and

377
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:38,399
um and some of us don't but and and i

378
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,760
think that that's it's sort of like

379
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:41,040
having an open source project that's

380
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,560
newbie friendly you know where we have

381
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,079
starter bugs and we have

382
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:46,319
a way of getting involved we need to

383
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:48,719
have a better on ramps to

384
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,360
to this and not just assume that

385
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:53,040
everything is

386
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:55,760
uh easy yeah and and another thing that

387
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,160
that that i've noticed happening uh and

388
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,360
i really

389
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:00,000
it really didn't make i'm clear to me

390
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:01,440
until today uh

391
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,200
or maybe maybe yesterday when i was

392
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,120
talking to some people um

393
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,480
we in this dev room are kind of a victim

394
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:09,279
of our own success

395
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:10,880
in certain types of ways we were the

396
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:11,920
first historically we were the first dev

397
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,600
room to not be

398
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:15,199
about software development which we're

399
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,880
very proud of this was

400
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,959
you know tom's idea basically was like

401
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:20,720
hey we could have a dev room about this

402
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:22,800
stuff and it's never been done before

403
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,560
uh that was we're excited and now there

404
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,359
are more than just us we're not the only

405
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:28,160
dev room now

406
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,560
uh uh one of the reasons we always give

407
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,079
up our

408
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,518
we don't do try to do two days anymore

409
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:33,120
is because community devroom has a lot

410
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,480
of the talks now that we would usually

411
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,279
have to do here because they weren't

412
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,760
welcome

413
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:38,480
in any other dev room uh and i got i get

414
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,319
the impression

415
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,920
and actually i've heard this from speak

416
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,560
from speakers and potential speakers

417
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:45,279
that there's

418
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:46,479
like a a career need to speak in this

419
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:47,680
dev room like people

420
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,680
need to speak in the stab room for their

421
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:52,160
own career development i mean i was

422
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:53,680
surprised by this and a little bit i

423
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,439
think probably all flattered as

424
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,800
organizers that that's that it's so

425
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,000
important to be in this dev room

426
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,359
speaking but on the other hand it kind

427
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,839
of changes the nature to a certain

428
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:04,399
extent

429
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:06,320
but i don't know if that's really true

430
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:08,160
but i know that definitely we know of a

431
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,760
person who believes that to be the case

432
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,360
i don't think it's true i don't i think

433
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:13,040
i think you can have you can have a very

434
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:16,959
successful career without ever speaking

435
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:19,040
in this

436
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:20,479
yeah so from the very beginning we we

437
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,160
conceived of this dev room as being an

438
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:24,160
advanced one and that was because

439
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:25,439
uh you know nine eight nine years ago

440
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,279
there were conferences

441
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,480
uh free software open source software

442
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:30,639
conferences that had

443
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:32,560
legal presentations and they tended to

444
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:33,360
be very kind of introductory and we

445
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,638
thought well there's

446
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,480
there's already conferences like

447
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:38,240
commercially kind of conferences

448
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,519
around open source and free software not

449
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,760
really free software open source

450
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:42,959
that are doing very introductory level

451
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,560
legal stuff

452
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:45,839
why don't we be the one that talks about

453
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,839
things at a more advanced level and

454
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:49,440
we're not the only one now

455
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:51,279
that does that although like we may be

456
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,399
the the only one that's kind of really

457
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:56,959
open to the public

458
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:59,279
which is something okay

459
00:14:56,959 --> 00:15:00,800
um one challenge i faced with some of

460
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:02,000
the talk with some of the debates was

461
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,760
remembering

462
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,120
what role people were supposed to have

463
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,399
because i knew a few of them and you'd

464
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,199
ask them to play a different role to

465
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:08,880
normal

466
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:11,439
i don't know whether we could have had

467
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:12,079
hats or personas up or color coding to

468
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,079
help us

469
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:15,519
and maybe also them remember which

470
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:18,079
position they were trying to take in

471
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:18,079
that debate

472
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:21,839
i thought about you know creating a web

473
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:24,399
app or something that would show you

474
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:26,000
where you were in the process and you

475
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:41,839
know what position people were taking

476
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:41,839
and you know the dog ate my homework

477
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,600
more questions

478
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:55,040
okay

479
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:03,439
thank you first um it's really cool to

480
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,959
see us experimenting with the dev room i

481
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,880
think this is my

482
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:08,239
fourth or fifth time here and this was

483
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:10,560
definitely way different than

484
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:12,720
the experience i've had other times so

485
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:15,439
um i like that we're trying to iterate

486
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:17,199
and improve and give new voices and give

487
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:20,800
other people a chance to

488
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:20,800
experiment with these positions

489
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:26,639
i think first uh i like it

490
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:28,399
i think we could do a little bit less of

491
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:29,839
it that would be like my first one

492
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:31,759
would be like have a few more

493
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:36,000
traditional talks mixed with it

494
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:38,560
but you know putting my advocacy hat on

495
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,199
we're in the midst of like a very fud

496
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,719
ridden

497
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:43,680
cycle right now and there's a lot of

498
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:45,839
misinformation going around and

499
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:47,359
i actually felt more confused about the

500
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:50,480
issues by the end of it

501
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:51,040
because it was i i don't know and i'm

502
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,040
like

503
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:55,040
i would consider myself a sophisticated

504
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:57,839
you know person who studies these things

505
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:59,120
and it was there were moments when i

506
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:01,680
forgot like

507
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:03,920
whether or not the speaker was you know

508
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,639
there was a lot of context switching so

509
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,639
maybe like

510
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,880
sticking to the guns a little more would

511
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,959
be helpful um

512
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,880
and it would be it's hard to me imagine

513
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:14,559
like a brand new person to the dev room

514
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,199
but again like this is an advanced dev

515
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:17,678
room in the

516
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:19,360
assumption so i am thankful that we do

517
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:20,640
it i think it'd be cool to do a more of

518
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:22,719
a balance of traditional

519
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,000
in the mix and have the roles better

520
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:26,000
delegated to

521
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,199
um and just you know i don't want to be

522
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,400
the guy that says we shouldn't have fun

523
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:29,840
in here like it was cool to see

524
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,440
everybody laughing

525
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,520
we need to laugh and we need to have

526
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,160
some joy in the dark times too so thank

527
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,760
you for

528
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:38,240
bringing a little bit of levity to these

529
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,240
times too

530
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,559
i also want to we we can continue to

531
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:44,320
talk about

532
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:46,000
uh the debates but i also want to just

533
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:49,360
make a shout out to our two

534
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:52,240
collaboration sessions we i mean i had

535
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:53,120
the idea that you know because there are

536
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:55,760
a lot of really

537
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:57,520
smart people in this room that we could

538
00:17:55,760 --> 00:18:00,000
brainstorm

539
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:01,120
ways of addressing some some issues and

540
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,080
i'm really glad that

541
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:04,639
attello and nate came to talk about that

542
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:07,039
i

543
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:08,880
apologize that you know the timing is

544
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:11,600
short 25 minutes is really

545
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:13,120
short to to address these things and i

546
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:15,039
really applaud them for

547
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:16,239
introducing these issues and you know

548
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:18,640
and um and

549
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:19,919
nate proactively you know setting up a a

550
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,760
link for people to continue the

551
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:26,559
discussion afterwards so

552
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:29,120
um just a uh a question on that

553
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:32,879
do people think that the idea of doing a

554
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,879
collaboration session was a good idea

555
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:38,559
okay let me ask a different question um

556
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:46,399
well yeah they were just the idea was

557
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,679
for them to be more discussion sessions

558
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,919
to you know

559
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:51,120
put put it forth a a problem statement

560
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:52,000
of something that was happening in our

561
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,840
community and maybe

562
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,120
you know really just have an interactive

563
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:58,240
session about how to

564
00:18:55,120 --> 00:19:00,239
address it um and if you

565
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:01,440
i you know i i guess i you know instead

566
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,039
of asking a question i'll just

567
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,400
maybe pass the mic around and have

568
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:05,919
people share their thoughts about that

569
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,039
what that we could do differently what

570
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:09,120
you liked what you didn't like

571
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:10,240
that sort of thing so kevin you can say

572
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,678
whatever it was that you were going to

573
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:13,520
see i just wanted to make a last comment

574
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:14,480
on the debate topic this is mostly for

575
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:17,440
bradley because he just

576
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:19,039
said he did all this research um when

577
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:20,320
these kinds of debates are held what is

578
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:23,039
the expectation for the

579
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:24,240
audience knowledge level that might be

580
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:25,840
an issue here is if

581
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,440
people didn't already have the

582
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:29,280
background knowledge of the topic that

583
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,799
was being discussed then you just jumped

584
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:33,760
right into the debate

585
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:35,600
maybe you need two minutes from an

586
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:37,120
introduction to just say this is a

587
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,799
current topic of discussion

588
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:40,399
here are some situations that are going

589
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:41,440
to be deleted or something like that so

590
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,400
i think there might be something around

591
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,000
the mic because it sounds like you're

592
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,200
not mic'd so i just wanted to make sure

593
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,559
i i heard the question i'm going to

594
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,520
repeat it just in case so the question

595
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:49,678
was like why

596
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:51,280
like how is this normally handled in

597
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:52,720
other places that have debates

598
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:54,480
um the thing is is the base structure

599
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:57,440
we're using is used for debate

600
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,919
tournaments um where to be quite frank

601
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,520
about it

602
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:01,120
it looks like from my research again i

603
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,918
just did a crash course like on this

604
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,760
myself i

605
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:05,520
i'm not an expert at all john sullivan

606
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,960
who i don't think is in the room

607
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:08,559
actually did both high school and

608
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,840
college and at graduate level he did

609
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:11,280
judging at these debate tournaments so

610
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,559
he knows a lot about it

611
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,799
but i was talking to him about it at

612
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:17,520
lunch as well and it was

613
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:19,520
they the policy position is all almost

614
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:22,080
moot right you just

615
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:23,918
you're graded and you're judged on how

616
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:26,320
well you construct your argument

617
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:27,360
and that's who wins is not necessarily

618
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:29,678
who

619
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,959
the right side and so and so i i don't

620
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:32,240
know if that format is right for us

621
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,919
because we're not trying to do that but

622
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,240
that's the format that is typically used

623
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:37,600
for

624
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:38,240
formal debates what if instead what we

625
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,480
do

626
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,280
next if we do it again and there are a

627
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,039
lot of ifs

628
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:45,520
contained in that but if we do it again

629
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:47,520
what if we have a presentation

630
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:49,840
on a certain topic and follow with a

631
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,960
debate related to that presentation

632
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:54,158
raise your hand if you think that would

633
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:54,159
be a good idea okay

634
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:01,200
you may also have situations where in

635
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:02,720
tournaments

636
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,400
the members of the audience are not

637
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:06,559
going to have strongly held personal

638
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:11,440
opinions about the thing being debated

639
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:11,440
in this room almost everyone will so

640
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:19,280
so on the collab sessions

641
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:20,959
i think that any of the anything that we

642
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:24,158
bring up that is going to be

643
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:27,520
meaningfully advanced within

644
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:30,080
within 25 or 40 or 50 minutes

645
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,639
is going to be too simple for this group

646
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,320
and any

647
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:34,240
and anything else is not going to be

648
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:37,039
meaningfully advanced within that time

649
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:38,159
time frame um i think that the co-lab

650
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:41,760
sessions would be

651
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:45,840
better used in better used in

652
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:45,840
in other ways okay sure

653
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,960
karen were you thinking like a fishbowl

654
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:56,719
type format

655
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:57,520
when you were asking well you're getting

656
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:00,559
close to it

657
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:03,600
not necessarily fishbowl directly but

658
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:05,840
more of sort of an unconference thing so

659
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,639
yeah so i mean i guess that's one idea

660
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:08,799
the other idea

661
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:09,679
going going van at what you were saying

662
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:12,799
is

663
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:14,240
i mean honestly it you remember the the

664
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:17,520
open source think tanks

665
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:19,120
where we would go and you you could

666
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:20,960
spend a couple hours

667
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:22,320
break up into groups work on some

668
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,280
problems and then everybody comes back

669
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:25,439
and present stuff

670
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:27,120
that would be another format which is a

671
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,080
huge deviation from anything we've ever

672
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,918
done here

673
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:32,000
but which people might be interested in

674
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:34,720
if we have problem statements

675
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,200
that are of the right magnitude i i

676
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,640
think

677
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:41,840
jim you're kind of agreeing with van

678
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:41,840
that it needs more time

679
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:46,000
raise your hand if you have burning

680
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:47,439
feedback on today that you

681
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,360
absolutely really want to give us

682
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:51,679
because i also want to give us a second

683
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:53,039
if anyone wants us to address any topics

684
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:55,039
of the day which this

685
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:56,400
has traditionally been the purpose of

686
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:57,919
the panel and i'm cognizant that some

687
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,559
people may have stayed for that

688
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:02,400
i don't know but we want to hear

689
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:04,799
important feedback

690
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:06,240
um if folks feel like there are points

691
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:08,000
that haven't been shared

692
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,760
but we're also very happy to get

693
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:13,600
feedback by email

694
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:15,360
um or we're in more public

695
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:22,030
places too with whatever you feel

696
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:22,750
comfortable with

697
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:30,480
[Music]

698
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:33,200
[Applause]

699
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:34,320
so we have so we have 20 minutes left

700
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:37,360
and

701
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:39,439
i turned to richard fontana because uh i

702
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:41,120
think he's a good person to decide what

703
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:43,919
things we might talk about for the

704
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:45,360
remaining uh 20 minutes of this panel

705
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:47,200
oh i don't know why you think that i

706
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:49,199
mean there's so much that we could talk

707
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:51,679
about so many so many exciting

708
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,480
issues well not so difficult yeah we can

709
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:56,559
ask

710
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:56,559
questions pam chustick

711
00:23:59,090 --> 00:24:05,840
[Laughter]

712
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,840
i have no exercise today this is great

713
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:13,760
if you also moved in closer yeah

714
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:15,919
it's way way too much trouble to move as

715
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:18,960
as four highly experienced

716
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:20,960
um people people involved in uh open

717
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:23,120
source for many many many years

718
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:25,039
i'm curious what your perspective is on

719
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:27,279
two things in particular the ethical

720
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:28,480
the ethical licenses and commercial open

721
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:30,320
source and whether

722
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,919
you see this as something that is very

723
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:33,439
different and groundbreaking or whether

724
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:35,760
this is same old same old we've been

725
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:39,760
here before

726
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:42,879
oh um i guess i i can start um

727
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:45,520
so it's not new um

728
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:46,880
neither thing is new we've had um

729
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:48,480
ethical

730
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:50,640
licenses that are sort of aimed at kind

731
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:53,520
of ethical or social policy problems

732
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:54,720
that kind of are that look a little bit

733
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:56,000
like free software like what we've

734
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,640
thought of as free software open source

735
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,960
licenses

736
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:00,559
um those of the debates over those have

737
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,200
happened at various times in the past i

738
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:05,039
think

739
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:06,960
the what's different now it to me is um

740
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:08,640
it just feels like a louder kind of

741
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:10,400
thing like there's more and and i think

742
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:12,400
it's less marginal so so it's

743
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:14,000
less marginalized so it's it's being

744
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:16,960
treated seriously

745
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,720
by people who i wouldn't see as being on

746
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:20,320
the fringes but rather are kind of like

747
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:22,480
very much within the

748
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:24,158
the the central part of what i think of

749
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,919
as the the kind of foss

750
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:28,080
um community and as for the the

751
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:30,559
commercial open source

752
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:31,520
um i mean that doesn't seem new either

753
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:32,960
what i

754
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:34,879
what kind of annoys me and i think i

755
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:37,600
actually got this maybe originally from

756
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:38,640
from um from josh uh something that i

757
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,879
heard josh say

758
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:42,559
once is that that um the people who are

759
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:43,760
advocating for what's called

760
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:46,158
what i think you mean by commercial open

761
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:46,480
source are kind of trying to piggyback

762
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:49,919
on

763
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:52,400
the the ethical uh source people

764
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:53,360
you know it's sort of trying to to um

765
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:56,480
appropriate

766
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:57,120
their uh you know their political

767
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,600
viewpoint

768
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:01,039
for basically making a kind of business

769
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:03,039
argument or a business model

770
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:05,200
kind of argument so that's very

771
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:08,720
disturbing

772
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:12,000
well i'm not a lawyer and i'm not your

773
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:15,039
lawyer and this is not legal advice

774
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,400
but i don't think a license is the right

775
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:18,960
place to try and

776
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:20,480
promote ethics i think that it's a

777
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:23,679
license

778
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:25,200
software license needs to be as simple

779
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:28,480
as possible and no simpler

780
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:30,159
really um i think that what makes open

781
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,440
source great is the ability for us to

782
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:32,799
collaborate without having to ask

783
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:36,720
permission

784
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:38,960
and um well many of these ethical

785
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:40,960
aims are completely laudable i think

786
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:43,840
that

787
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:45,520
the potential for proliferation of

788
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:47,760
ethical licenses

789
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,639
will only cause problems for us and that

790
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:51,520
was one thing that i

791
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:53,840
learned or really stood out in my mind

792
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:56,960
from the debates today is that

793
00:26:53,840 --> 00:27:00,240
we could have a variety of

794
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:02,000
ethical licenses

795
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:03,360
and then there will all be incompatible

796
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,200
with each other and our compatibility

797
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:06,399
will be excruciatingly painful so i

798
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,000
don't think that that

799
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,760
i don't think that that works i don't i

800
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,679
don't think it's the right way to do it

801
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:13,039
um and i'm going to ask pam to clarify

802
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:14,240
what did you mean by commercial open

803
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:16,320
source because i don't understand the

804
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:21,039
question

805
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:21,039
yeah so yeah like i think

806
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:33,520
yeah okay well yeah so i

807
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:34,639
i think you know the short the shorthand

808
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:36,799
version of commons

809
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:37,919
clause in particular is that if you

810
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:40,559
sprinkle that in your open source

811
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:45,760
license it's no longer open source

812
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:49,840
um i think that the idea of

813
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:54,000
restricting licenses use

814
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:56,000
for well i think let's be honest

815
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,840
to really to discriminate against cloud

816
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,559
providers or software as a service

817
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:01,678
providers

818
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:02,000
is defeating freedom zero which is the

819
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:04,159
the

820
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,360
freedom to run the program i i think

821
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:08,960
that it's really

822
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:10,959
not uh it's not

823
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:12,799
it's a goal that's not really an open

824
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:14,159
source goal it's more of a

825
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:16,240
it's more of a business goal and if you

826
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:17,440
really want to have a license like that

827
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:19,360
that's completely fine

828
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:20,960
and you can have a proprietary license

829
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:22,240
just please don't try to call it open

830
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:24,880
source or try to

831
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:27,520
come to me and redefine what the word

832
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:29,600
open source should mean

833
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:30,960
right i think we need public processes

834
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,279
around it i mean i think this is one of

835
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,760
the

836
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:35,200
the the things that i really like about

837
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:36,559
licenses that have been drafted in a

838
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,520
community process it's one of the things

839
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:40,000
i like actually

840
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:41,679
i really like about the osi review

841
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,320
license review process is that that's

842
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:44,880
done

843
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:45,760
in a public way with with input i think

844
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:48,799
that the drop

845
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:50,399
i i i think that having more

846
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:52,480
drafting processes that are groups i

847
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:54,320
mean so to for my view on the

848
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,600
ethical licensing and i'm leading a

849
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:59,520
discussion on

850
00:28:55,600 --> 00:29:01,360
monday at copyleft conf a little plug in

851
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,720
case you don't know about it it's a it's

852
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:06,479
a one day conference

853
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:10,480
uh on monday copylefconf.org um

854
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:11,440
and uh my my my view on it which i'll be

855
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:13,200
more coy about

856
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:16,159
there because i'm more leading a

857
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:18,640
discussion is that i think it reflects

858
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:19,279
our utter failure as a movement to be

859
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:22,320
leaders

860
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:24,399
in like for ethical technology

861
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:25,760
like i think that we identified that

862
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:26,639
there is something special about

863
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:28,158
software freedom

864
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:30,240
that there's something special about the

865
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:32,799
ethics of technology

866
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:34,320
and we got on board early right we were

867
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:35,918
like some of the first people to start

868
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:37,918
talking about it and then

869
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:40,000
you start seeing tv shows like silicon

870
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:42,640
valley spoofing companies

871
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,360
using our rhetoric and so much of that

872
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:47,279
is that we

873
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:49,600
fail to really draw a a a clear line

874
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:51,120
and we fail to lead and there's this

875
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,918
idea that while there are all these

876
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,840
problems

877
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:56,480
and we have the sense that licensing may

878
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:59,039
be able to take care of some of that

879
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:00,480
and so why can't we use this and embrace

880
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:02,879
it and go to the next level

881
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:04,240
and i think that we as a software

882
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:08,159
freedom community both

883
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:09,679
the existing old guard and um and

884
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:10,559
everyone knew who's expressing an

885
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:12,159
interest now

886
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:14,080
can come together and take the best

887
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:15,120
ideas of some of these these things and

888
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:17,120
start thinking from

889
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:19,120
from scratch and not throwing away

890
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:22,320
anything that we have before

891
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:24,158
certainly but um but you know

892
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:25,678
seeing if any of those ideas are good

893
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:28,399
for any other initiatives that aren't

894
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:30,159
necessarily licensing

895
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:32,320
yeah to the first part of your question

896
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:34,240
pam which was is this new

897
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:37,039
i agree with fontana it is it is so

898
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:40,240
unknew that it's ridiculously old

899
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:41,279
the first time i saw a modification of

900
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:45,360
gpl to say

901
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:48,240
not for military use i think was 1996

902
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:49,360
but it was no later than 1998 of people

903
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:51,279
trying to do that

904
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:54,240
and the first time i saw you know

905
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:56,880
basically non-commercial use only

906
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:57,760
source available licenses was when i was

907
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:00,880
an undergraduate

908
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:02,240
in like 92-93 i was very common in

909
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:04,080
academic communities they would put

910
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:05,600
software out non-commercial use only and

911
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:07,600
hope to get some sort of

912
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:09,279
contractual funding for the commercial

913
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:10,639
use so those things have been around for

914
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:14,320
a while i think the difference

915
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:15,600
now um is really a failure

916
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:17,678
like karen was saying a failure of

917
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:19,039
leadership but i have a

918
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:22,640
slightly different way of looking at it

919
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:26,399
i think the community that understood

920
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:28,240
why clear licensing was important and

921
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:29,518
definitions of what licensure should do

922
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:31,840
was important

923
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:33,600
um was not very connected with a

924
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:36,080
generation of software developers that

925
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:37,760
kind of came up in the late 2000s

926
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:39,039
and yeah i mean i think how many people

927
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:42,320
in the room are would consider yourself

928
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:43,919
primarily a javascript developer

929
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:45,519
there's actually two in the room i i was

930
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:46,640
expecting to get three i was expecting

931
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:48,559
to get zero

932
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:50,240
um because there's really because we

933
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:51,200
never connected with that community in

934
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:54,000
the way that we should have

935
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:54,880
as as like free software activists uh

936
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,080
and there's a

937
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,760
ton of different things that went wrong

938
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:59,360
because of that because we didn't take

939
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:01,120
them seriously and that was our fault

940
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,678
and that was another way the leadership

941
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:05,600
was bad

942
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:05,600
uh historically in fuss

943
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:10,159
hi i think they're another thing oh yeah

944
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:14,000
go ahead

945
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:17,679
so one question related here is that

946
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:19,919
the ethical licenses seem to be

947
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:21,919
following a code of conduct kind of

948
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:22,559
behavior trying to enforce a code of

949
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:26,399
conduct

950
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:30,639
for the corporate user community or

951
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:33,279
provide a community if you want it while

952
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:34,320
trying to defend against abusive for

953
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:37,840
some reason

954
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:41,120
behavior by these corporations against

955
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:44,240
others or in the community or as

956
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:46,719
isolationists so

957
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:48,880
how have we been able to enforce our

958
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:52,480
codes of conduct in

959
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:52,480
user communities in the past

960
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:58,559
well codes of so so project codes of

961
00:32:55,600 --> 00:33:00,080
conduct haven't been

962
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:02,000
as i understand them haven't been

963
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:05,279
targeted

964
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:07,679
against participation outside of a

965
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:08,960
project itself so there's been this

966
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:12,159
assumption that you

967
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:13,919
you can you can if you're a copyright

968
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:16,240
owner you can police

969
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:17,279
um behavior that falls outside the scope

970
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:21,679
of the license

971
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:24,480
um but but codes of conduct are are

972
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:26,159
things that only apply to in activity

973
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:28,559
within a project or activity

974
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:30,799
at a projects uh event for example at a

975
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:33,760
conference like this one

976
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:34,320
um so i think that that maybe that that

977
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:38,000
kind of

978
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:40,720
distinction may frustrate some

979
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,440
some people who um you know they they

980
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:43,440
see this

981
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:44,960
i would say the success of the adoption

982
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:46,799
of codes of conduct by projects

983
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:48,399
but they see a gap between you know what

984
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:50,879
those cover and

985
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:52,158
the way the software is being used um in

986
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:54,880
a much larger

987
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:56,080
sphere outside of the project itself so

988
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:59,120
i'm i mean i'm

989
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:59,918
i'm pretty sympathetic actually to um a

990
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:02,879
lot of the

991
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:05,200
the people who are talking about you

992
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:06,000
know ethical licenses i i agree with

993
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:08,000
what others have

994
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,520
said that that you know i don't feel

995
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,879
that licenses are a good

996
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:15,199
mechanism um i i don't currently believe

997
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:16,399
that um that these kinds of licenses

998
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:17,598
should be considered free software

999
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:20,719
licenses

1000
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:21,839
um but but i i do i think that i have a

1001
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:24,480
lot of sympathy and

1002
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:25,520
and um i feel that what i don't know

1003
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:27,199
what what others

1004
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:28,480
here think but i as i said before i

1005
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:29,359
think that what's different now is that

1006
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:31,440
this is not

1007
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:32,639
um this is not a fringe thing this is

1008
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,839
like

1009
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:35,919
there are people who are speaking out

1010
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:37,599
about this issue who are really at the

1011
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:41,040
very center of

1012
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:41,040
of this this movement

1013
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:47,118
um this question is for you karen

1014
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:50,239
because you sort of mentioned

1015
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:52,720
better yes cool uh you sort of mentioned

1016
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:54,399
the sort of the the ethical core of the

1017
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:56,000
free software movement that got a lot of

1018
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:57,759
people interested and how it feels like

1019
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,760
maybe in some ways it's failed or it's

1020
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:01,440
moved away from that

1021
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:03,359
and this is a big issue that we are

1022
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:06,720
seeing in the software industry

1023
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:09,040
i i'd like to hear more about you know

1024
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:10,720
do you do you feel like this issue still

1025
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:12,960
sits within the free software community

1026
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:15,439
and the organizations advocating for it

1027
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:16,240
and if so what sort of role do you

1028
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:18,960
envision

1029
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:20,078
these organizations playing yeah i mean

1030
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:22,560
it's funny because saying

1031
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:25,040
this issue is tough there are so many

1032
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:28,240
issues that are being raised and i

1033
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:31,680
don't know but the intersection from

1034
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:34,560
between um our software and our lives

1035
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:35,440
is the critical part of where we operate

1036
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:38,960
and

1037
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:40,320
you know for and you ask me so i assume

1038
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:42,320
it's in part because

1039
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:43,680
i work at software freedom conservancy

1040
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:48,160
and i advocate for

1041
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:51,520
suffer freedom as a you know public good

1042
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:56,240
um so i'll i'll say in that like if

1043
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:58,400
in if in conservancy's judgment that

1044
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:59,839
we're not talking about um critical

1045
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:01,839
issues that affect

1046
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:03,359
people's lives and that are essential

1047
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:06,400
for us to have

1048
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:08,000
a better you know

1049
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:10,160
situation with our technology then i

1050
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,400
don't then i assume that

1051
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:13,920
we and conservancies board would decide

1052
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:16,320
not to work on those issues

1053
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:17,280
so to me i think where software touches

1054
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,720
all these issues i think they're

1055
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:20,320
critically important and i think we need

1056
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:22,399
to think about them and that's why

1057
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:23,839
you know i've tried to work on things

1058
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:25,440
like contract patch and

1059
00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:26,880
getting people to talk about their

1060
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:28,560
employment agreements and

1061
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:30,000
thinking creatively about all the

1062
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:31,839
different ways that we can

1063
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,640
the the main thing about what i try to

1064
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:38,720
do and we try to do is to think about

1065
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:41,279
like what pragmatic activities can we do

1066
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:44,799
to address the issue at hand

1067
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:46,720
um and you know that's been sort of our

1068
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:48,480
our role in our niche and so we're we're

1069
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:50,480
kind of like project based

1070
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:51,839
you know like and i think that's true of

1071
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:53,280
some of our member projects too and we

1072
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:55,040
have very close relationship with like

1073
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:57,920
outreachy for example because

1074
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:58,400
where we see in equity that's a project

1075
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:01,760
that

1076
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:03,280
um that we you know we we're we're

1077
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:05,440
a little more involved in than even just

1078
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:07,200
our normal member project so

1079
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:08,880
um you know and have a real partnership

1080
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:10,480
there so i you know this is a very

1081
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:13,040
blathering non-answer actually

1082
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:13,599
as i listen to myself talk um but i

1083
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:15,440
would say

1084
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:23,839
we have to be active here because

1085
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:23,839
otherwise what are we doing

1086
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,040
yeah hello so following back on today

1087
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,319
and

1088
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:40,160
you've been participating in a lot of

1089
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:42,720
things um just

1090
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:43,520
ask a question about like the the

1091
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:45,040
politics

1092
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:47,040
of open source that we've seen today

1093
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:48,640
right and uh first i

1094
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:50,079
highly respect i discover more and more

1095
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:51,680
about your background and what you've

1096
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:53,119
done over the last years and and i

1097
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:54,960
totally respect that

1098
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:56,720
uh but let's say from a lot of the

1099
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:59,920
people people who spoke like

1100
00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:02,078
there is a big let's say india direct or

1101
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:03,119
indirect link to big corporation funding

1102
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:05,680
right at some point

1103
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:07,040
and and we we can state that they've

1104
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:08,879
done great things also

1105
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:10,400
to contribute to open source but my

1106
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:12,480
question as you are

1107
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:14,000
leaders leaders in this space and for

1108
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:16,160
all the leaders in that space say what

1109
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,720
are the guarantees the community takes

1110
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:19,759
to be sure to always be independent in

1111
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:22,640
ethics

1112
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:23,520
with this i'm sure i think we can keep

1113
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:26,319
our ethics

1114
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:27,119
we even we are funded with uh whatever

1115
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,320
funds the thing

1116
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:30,240
but what are the guarantees the

1117
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:33,119
community has taken over time and what

1118
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:36,240
are the current ones today if i'm

1119
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:37,760
understood well well i'll i'll take a

1120
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:40,799
stab at that i

1121
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:44,720
i i think that it's a

1122
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:47,520
it's a really tough question i for me

1123
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:50,560
in my experience you know when i first

1124
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:52,960
got involved with free software it was

1125
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:55,359
almost exclusively volunteers and now

1126
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:58,320
there are a lot of people that are

1127
00:38:55,359 --> 00:39:00,240
you know that do open source as their

1128
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:02,960
day job and i think that's great

1129
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:04,720
um and you know you bring up a question

1130
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:08,480
of what what does that influence mean

1131
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:09,839
you know for the movement and

1132
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:11,599
you know i think that it's it's a tough

1133
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:15,040
question but i i actually think that

1134
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:17,200
you know stepping back we're at a moment

1135
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:18,720
in our in our movement where we're being

1136
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:21,919
challenged by

1137
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:23,598
the definition of our movement at all

1138
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:25,359
what is it that priests what does free

1139
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:28,720
software mean what does

1140
00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:30,319
open source mean and you know one of the

1141
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:31,598
things that we heard earlier today is

1142
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:33,920
that

1143
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:34,720
our original notions of this that we got

1144
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:38,000
written down

1145
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:38,399
are you know quite quite all 20 years

1146
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,920
old

1147
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:43,440
and so answering your question about

1148
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:46,480
ethics i think has to

1149
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:48,560
we even have to you know think of what

1150
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:52,160
is the evolution of our movement

1151
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:56,160
and what does it mean i i i think that

1152
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:58,720
that can answer your question i

1153
00:39:56,160 --> 00:40:00,399
for me i'm really motivated by the idea

1154
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:01,439
of collaboration and not having to ask

1155
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:04,960
permission

1156
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:06,319
and uh maybe some classic notions of

1157
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:09,359
software freedom

1158
00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:11,119
um and i think that

1159
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:13,040
it's tricky to see how that's going to

1160
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:14,480
evolve with all the things that have

1161
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:17,599
put pressure on us like network

1162
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:19,520
computing and um

1163
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:20,640
and such things so it's it's a it's a

1164
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:22,880
tough question but i think that we even

1165
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:24,879
have a bigger question which is

1166
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:26,800
how are we defining what we're doing and

1167
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:29,760
how are we educating people that are

1168
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:31,760
that are new into caring about what it

1169
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:33,200
is that we care about

1170
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:35,359
yeah i appreciate you mentioning

1171
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:37,520
politics committee karen

1172
00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:38,400
often tells me to stop saying that

1173
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:40,560
fundamentally

1174
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,599
the work that at least i do not too much

1175
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:44,880
as she does is

1176
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:46,880
is basically being a politician but

1177
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:48,720
free software and open source has become

1178
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:50,880
a political process

1179
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:52,720
it's the worst kind of political process

1180
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:53,920
in a lot of ways because we as you

1181
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:55,598
mentioned we have all these companies

1182
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:56,079
that have this influence nobody elected

1183
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:58,960
them

1184
00:40:56,079 --> 00:41:00,880
that they don't represent the community

1185
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:01,920
and nobody elected me either it would be

1186
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:03,520
a conservancy we have a

1187
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:05,119
self-perpetuating board

1188
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:07,359
the osi deserves credit for being

1189
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:08,800
basically the only organization in our

1190
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:09,598
community that actually holds an

1191
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:12,640
election

1192
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:14,400
and goes to the people you know um

1193
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:16,160
but let's let's put that aside for a

1194
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:18,240
moment um i think it's great that they

1195
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:20,160
run an election they actually get votes

1196
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:21,359
and respect the votes of of their

1197
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:24,399
constituency

1198
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:27,920
um and and we need more of that kind of

1199
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:29,520
republic uh small our republic kind of

1200
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:31,280
representation debian is another great

1201
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:32,319
example that's a constitutes the only

1202
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:34,480
free software project that's

1203
00:41:32,319 --> 00:41:35,759
constitutional republic um and

1204
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:37,599
and so and so we have this weird

1205
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:38,720
political structure which is just right

1206
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:40,480
for corruption

1207
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:42,240
because there's corporations floating

1208
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:43,359
around hiring people and people go to

1209
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:45,118
work for companies even though they're

1210
00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:47,200
technically working on a project

1211
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:48,400
and we have not solved any of that

1212
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:50,879
political complication

1213
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:51,680
and i work on it every day and i really

1214
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:53,520
don't even

1215
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:55,919
know if i understand how it works and

1216
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:58,640
how to fix it and how to make it better

1217
00:41:55,920 --> 00:42:00,000
so so i it's it's really tough i i don't

1218
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:01,680
know what to do about it but i i

1219
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
recognize this is what you're raising a

1220
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:04,319
huge

1221
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,319
problem

1222
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:08,560
so first thank you for this session

1223
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:10,720
because i think it's the most

1224
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:14,640
interesting session of the day

1225
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:16,000
um one point on my side as a european

1226
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:19,520
person

1227
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:20,880
i'm a bit not finding

1228
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:22,960
everything i would like to find in this

1229
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:26,240
type of session because i like the

1230
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:29,359
european vision as well in addition to

1231
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:30,959
a more u.s centric vision of the law so

1232
00:42:29,359 --> 00:42:32,240
i would like for example the google

1233
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:34,960
versus oracle

1234
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:37,598
case i would love to see what does the

1235
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:38,480
supreme court result means for us in

1236
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:40,400
europe

1237
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:41,760
what does it mean for us what would be

1238
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:45,040
the consequences

1239
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:47,119
is there any impact for us as well and

1240
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:48,079
for all the rest of the day i would also

1241
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:50,079
like to have

1242
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:51,760
in the board with you some european

1243
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:54,800
lawyers that could bring

1244
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:55,280
an additional uh set of information

1245
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:57,119
around

1246
00:42:55,280 --> 00:43:00,960
what what you are bringing which is

1247
00:42:57,119 --> 00:43:00,960
already great don't take me wrong

1248
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:09,599
so a couple of points um

1249
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:10,879
your your question is very very apropos

1250
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:13,040
i think it would be really great to have

1251
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:14,880
an analysis of what

1252
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:16,240
oracle v google would mean specifically

1253
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:18,000
to the european union that's a it's a

1254
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:20,240
fabulous question

1255
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,040
we have throughout the history of the

1256
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:23,118
dev room we've

1257
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:24,319
really tried hard to represent a

1258
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:27,599
diversity of views

1259
00:43:24,319 --> 00:43:31,359
and diversity not just of

1260
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:32,720
europeans uh and

1261
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:35,119
people from all around the world but

1262
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:35,598
also from women and underrepresented

1263
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:38,800
people

1264
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:39,520
so uh and you you saw european lawyers

1265
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:42,400
up today you

1266
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:42,960
heard miriam's cross-examination she's

1267
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:46,000
brilliant

1268
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:46,480
that was great um and we've had you know

1269
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,720
other

1270
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:48,720
um

1271
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:54,640
like six or seven yeah so we had a

1272
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:56,960
variety it could be better

1273
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:58,000
and i i take that i take that point and

1274
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:00,880
i do want to go

1275
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:03,359
further and acknowledge that one of the

1276
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:06,560
the campaigns that i most admire

1277
00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:08,560
in europe is uh public you know code

1278
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:09,920
you know public money public code i

1279
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:10,400
think that this is a great message and

1280
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:13,119
this is

1281
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:15,040
uh something that can articulate what we

1282
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:17,119
care about to a broader audience and

1283
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:18,319
and i think that that that message and

1284
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:20,800
talking to my

1285
00:44:18,319 --> 00:44:22,160
fellow europeans has has been well

1286
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:24,079
received i think people

1287
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:25,598
in the general population get that

1288
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:27,599
message more

1289
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:28,720
readily than the equivalent of americans

1290
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:30,800
so

1291
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:32,399
i love the like cross jurisdictional

1292
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:34,000
aspect of your question and i

1293
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:36,800
i think if we do this again we should

1294
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:38,640
absolutely see because we we do a cfp

1295
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:40,720
but we wind up not getting as many

1296
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:42,000
submissions or all along the things that

1297
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:43,759
we think should be addressed so we'll

1298
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,240
work hard to encourage people to submit

1299
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:46,880
on

1300
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:48,839
topics that evaluate these cases and

1301
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:50,800
across jurisdictional way i really like

1302
00:44:48,839 --> 00:44:52,960
that there's an event

1303
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:55,200
and i just want to say as i often do

1304
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:56,960
when i travel outside the us

1305
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:58,480
i apologize for my country and the

1306
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:00,160
policies that it exports around the

1307
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:05,839
world

1308
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:05,839
i was born there it wasn't my fault to

1309
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:19,839
oh

1310
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:24,799
okay we'll pass philippe the microphone

1311
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:26,720
a little bit later for him to make his

1312
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:29,440
point there's a question here

1313
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:30,560
it's not a question i i'd like to to

1314
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:32,720
answer what

1315
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:33,839
does oracle the google mean in the

1316
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:36,399
european union

1317
00:45:33,839 --> 00:45:38,000
so the european copyright directive on

1318
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:41,359
computer programs

1319
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:42,880
explicitly excludes interfaces from

1320
00:45:41,359 --> 00:45:46,319
being copyrightable

1321
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:49,599
to to foster interoperability

1322
00:45:46,319 --> 00:45:50,079
so at least from my view there wouldn't

1323
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:52,480
be

1324
00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:55,920
such a case in europe google could just

1325
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:55,920
have taken the interface

1326
00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:01,839
right can you take the mic

1327
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:09,920
thank you so much

1328
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:16,160
[Applause]

1329
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:16,960
yeah i i just there is a case the sas

1330
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:19,839
case

1331
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:20,400
the in the ecj i think that is directly

1332
00:46:19,839 --> 00:46:23,440
on point

1333
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:26,800
on with your comment

1334
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:28,480
it's interesting to imagine if the ecj

1335
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:30,400
rules one way and the supreme court

1336
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:31,920
rules a different way

1337
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:33,680
that's going to make our life even more

1338
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:36,319
complicated

1339
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:37,040
okay philippe wanted to say something

1340
00:46:36,319 --> 00:46:40,720
okay

1341
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:42,960
okay so my question following up on

1342
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:46,399
what you said about what could be new

1343
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:50,000
ways for the free software movement to

1344
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:52,720
uh not really reinvent itself but like

1345
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,839
find an identity that matters now you

1346
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:56,078
mentioned just now

1347
00:46:53,839 --> 00:46:59,040
public money public code but in general

1348
00:46:56,079 --> 00:47:01,680
the starting from the free for freedoms

1349
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:03,040
or the open source definition all the

1350
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:03,759
definitions of the free software

1351
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:07,680
movement

1352
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:07,680
have been very much focused on what

1353
00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:14,880
could be appealing to developers

1354
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:16,879
uh do you think that we miss missed an

1355
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:18,880
opportunity to involve the users

1356
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:20,319
yes yes yes i agree with you i agree

1357
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:22,559
with everything you're about to say

1358
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:24,000
yes no no i was going to say when and

1359
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:25,920
how and what could we do

1360
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:27,760
now it's only questions you cannot agree

1361
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:31,040
with them well i

1362
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:32,720
well this is you know kind of a subject

1363
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:36,000
that's close to my heart which is

1364
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:38,959
how can we give users standing in

1365
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,920
free software culture and hardware and

1366
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:42,880
one you know one of the

1367
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:44,880
challenges that we have especially in

1368
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:49,119
considering open hardware licenses

1369
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:50,720
is that the end user that receives a

1370
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:54,000
product

1371
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:57,118
doesn't have standing to insist on the

1372
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:58,319
source and i i think we need to

1373
00:47:57,119 --> 00:48:00,559
you know i think we need to involve

1374
00:47:58,319 --> 00:48:02,319
users i like that this might be a good

1375
00:48:00,559 --> 00:48:04,000
thing to discuss next year if we have a

1376
00:48:02,319 --> 00:48:06,480

1377
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:07,040
