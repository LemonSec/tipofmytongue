1
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:13,360
okay

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:15,599
hi first of all thank you for the open

3
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:17,359
research tools and technology team

4
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:19,680
i'm honored to be part of this fantastic

5
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:23,359
game my name is antoine fuschi

6
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:24,160
i'm an all-new phd student because i'm

7
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:27,920
36

8
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:30,080
and i'm from montreal but i'm french

9
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,599
you have already figured it with my

10
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:34,640
beautiful accent

11
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:37,520
i'm going to talk about writing tools

12
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,399
publication tuition and freedom my

13
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,960
presentation

14
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,440
is already available online as you can

15
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,320
see

16
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:46,000
and i'm uv i'm using reveal.js so you

17
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:50,719
can watch my notes

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,800
with the sk so the plan

19
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:54,559
so you can understand the team starting

20
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,000
point i have to explain at further

21
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:57,919
context

22
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,520
then i will press on the tools that are

23
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,920
used by the majority

24
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,719
in the scientific community and i call

25
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,840
them

26
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:08,000
tools of pain not that i'm not going to

27
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,280
say burn all the word processors but a

28
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,360
little bit

29
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,479
the third part is about what we need for

30
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:15,119
doing our job

31
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:16,799
our researchers such as comfort i like

32
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:17,600
the new buzzword in the development

33
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:22,080
community

34
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:24,399
dx like uwex for developer experience

35
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,200
and finally i will present about great

36
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,000
beautiful

37
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,320
but powerful and free tools and of

38
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,640
course i'm going to introduce tilo

39
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:35,679
a gorgeous user-friendly text editor for

40
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:38,720
humanities scholars

41
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:40,560
ok so first context with academic

42
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:44,000
publishing humanities scholars

43
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:46,880
and digital world publishing

44
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,520
ecosystem is not uniform and academic

45
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:52,399
publishing have specific requirements

46
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,960
first of all it's all about cementing

47
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:54,960
texts

48
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:58,000
with current footnotes as you know

49
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:01,759
citation and bibliographic data

50
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,399
in the publishing ecosystem we love pdf

51
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:05,840
but we need the web it's a fact even if

52
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:08,639
sometimes you would like

53
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,039
to see the frozen pdf format disappear

54
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:11,839
and

55
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:13,279
it's all about xml in academic

56
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,000
publishing xml is

57
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,319
everywhere it's the source of all joy

58
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,120
and

59
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:20,720
depression joy because we can do

60
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,280
everything with xml

61
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,840
depression because mostly we create a

62
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,120
big

63
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:30,640
big technical depth never forget that

64
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:33,599
docx is actually xml

65
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,640
the context with humanity scholars it's

66
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:37,839
all about text

67
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:39,200
i'm aware that we all come from a wide

68
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:42,000
variety of fields

69
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:44,000
here so i need to clarify specificities

70
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,280
for the humanities it's about text

71
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,879
and sometimes data if the text is the

72
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:52,319
horizon of the research

73
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:54,879
we must handle it with care

74
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:55,359
the context with the digital world

75
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:58,640
saying

76
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,680
as an evidence or world is now a digital

77
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:02,799
one

78
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:05,599
even if you don't want to be connected

79
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:07,440
or don't have an academia profile a

80
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:10,720
twitter dependency

81
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:12,079
or your own website as researchers we

82
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,640
can't write a paper

83
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:16,319
without metadata to create content

84
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:19,679
bibliographic database or

85
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:20,799
collaborative tools and in the future as

86
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,560
we know

87
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,959
we will we will have to transform our

88
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:28,000
research into available data

89
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:30,799
if we haven't already done so

90
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,360
second part the tool of paint with world

91
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:36,319
latex

92
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:36,319
duality and google docs limitation

93
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:42,480
microsoft word it's a realistic and

94
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,959
depressing domination

95
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,238
it's appropriate software as you know

96
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:48,640
and the major

97
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:50,959
issue with word and with liberofist

98
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:53,040
writer is the confusion between content

99
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:54,400
and form or structure and graphing

100
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,640
rendering

101
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,480
most of the time microsoft word users

102
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:01,679
think that graphing wondering

103
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:04,238
is a structure but a word in bold

104
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:07,599
is not objectively an emphasis although

105
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:09,680
an emphasis can be involved

106
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:11,679
when a publisher requires establish it

107
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,280
or give some structure gun lights

108
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:16,560
it's not easy for the writer to

109
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:18,639
understand and apply it

110
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,918
those are the files that constitute a

111
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:23,440
word document

112
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:26,479
when you typed hello and saved

113
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,800
it's quite tricky just for one word it's

114
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:29,520
a

115
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:31,199
picture from the information architect

116
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:34,159
agency

117
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:35,199
uh latex it's very powerful but too

118
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,440
complicated

119
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,479
waterline tools like overleaf reduce the

120
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,880
complexity

121
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:42,080
of latex but it's still a very

122
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,560
restrictive tool

123
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:46,159
we cannot ask the writer to not forget

124
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:49,680
to close a bracket for example

125
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:51,280
or to learn a new syntax google docs is

126
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,280
becoming very common

127
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:55,198
with a lot of constraints it's

128
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,599
connection dependency

129
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:59,360
proprietary crude so bad for your

130
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:02,639
privacy as we know

131
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:06,080
and semantically limited

132
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:06,080
it's the new microsoft word

133
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:12,880
what we want now semantic content data

134
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,758
meaningful artifacts single source

135
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:18,080
publishing

136
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:21,840
and easy interfaces cementing content

137
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:25,120
as researchers we want to write

138
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:27,520
texts and to both inscribe and structure

139
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:30,800
we need tools that allow to do that both

140
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:34,639
it's not just about bolt and italic

141
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:38,479
manifold artifacts like pdf xml

142
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:40,800
html web epub and other formats like

143
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:43,199
your docx if you want

144
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,639
and single source publishing researchers

145
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,720
and editors

146
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:49,280
can't work on the same version of a

147
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:52,080
document

148
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,638
manifold artifacts one source like word

149
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,039
version

150
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:55,759
for an author in design version xml

151
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:58,159
version

152
00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:01,520
it's hard to maintain free phrase

153
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,520
version of one document

154
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:07,039
what we want usable and efficient

155
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:10,080
interfaces

156
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:10,880
easy and powerful interfaces like google

157
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,280
docs introduce

158
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:15,280
an attempt of efficient interfaces we

159
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:18,840
need different level of editing

160
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:20,239
for the author the editor and data

161
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:22,000
manager

162
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,520
just a quick view of three tools that

163
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,080
allows through curation

164
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:27,120
dynamic bibliographic data and manifold

165
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:30,318
artifacts with

166
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,440
one and unique source like mardon csl

167
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:33,759
and pandoc

168
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:36,560
markdown is a great compromise between

169
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:38,960
interpretability and simple markup

170
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,880
and magdalen is extensive with html

171
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:43,599
classes

172
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,800
here an example of the markup and the

173
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:49,520
rendering

174
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:51,840
as you can see is very simple

175
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,919
csl for structural citation and

176
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,880
bibliographies with any bibliography

177
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:58,719
styles

178
00:06:54,880 --> 00:07:01,280
there is many many bibliographic styles

179
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,080
and panox for transform and convert from

180
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,479
any source

181
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,680
to a lot of formats but you have to use

182
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:10,639
a damn terminal

183
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:13,680
it's hard for a common user

184
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:16,160
now still it's time to show you a tool

185
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:19,120
as an answer of what researchers and

186
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:21,520
editors want in human sciences field

187
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,720
stillo is a modular and whizzy whim what

188
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:25,359
you see is what you mean

189
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:27,360
and not what you see is what you get

190
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:30,560
text editor for scientific writing

191
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:33,280
and publishing

192
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,720
first of all stillow is a modular

193
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:37,119
solution for scientific

194
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,120
writing

195
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:42,880
we brings mcdonald's cesel pandunk and

196
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:46,878
the usable interface together

197
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:49,120
and we use hypothesis for reviving

198
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:50,479
the text editor with markup markdown

199
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,840
bibliographic data

200
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:56,800
in bibtex are using the zotero api

201
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,280
metadata management with yaml and we

202
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,319
have

203
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:01,280
many other former and platform the

204
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:04,800
platform of

205
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:07,599
stillow is a in mongodb graphql

206
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,599
and react.js

207
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,479
here as you can see stillway is composed

208
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:26,479
of three areas

209
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:30,080
it's not very nice

210
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:31,039
um in the center you can see the content

211
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:35,519
uh

212
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:38,080
manager it's just modern

213
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:38,640
on the left you have the versioning

214
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:42,000
preview

215
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:44,720
export bibliography and information and

216
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:48,160
on the right we have the metadata with

217
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,160
three levels of management

218
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:57,199
here's the version on your

219
00:08:53,360 --> 00:09:00,640
left table of contents

220
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:02,959
bibliography imported for bibtex files

221
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:04,959
or from a collection of a zotero shared

222
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:07,359
group

223
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:08,560
editor mod for the media metadata on the

224
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:11,680
right

225
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:14,319
and an other mode as a war mode

226
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:15,199
you can move you can add new fields as

227
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:19,519
you want

228
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:21,040
here the preview is just an html export

229
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:24,560
with a default still sheet

230
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:26,640
on the preview it's possible to unattach

231
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,760
the preview for reviewing a paper for

232
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,920
example

233
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,200
we use hypothesis a great web annotation

234
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:34,000
service and the

235
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:37,839
hypothesis allows you allow to use

236
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,839
private group for private annotations

237
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,040
and it's possible to export in many

238
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:43,359
formats

239
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:45,040
the file exports use three sorts of

240
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,600
documents

241
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:50,240
the markdown of course a bibtex file for

242
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:53,440
the bibliographic references and

243
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:57,440
yaml for the metadata we can use

244
00:09:53,440 --> 00:10:04,000
a xslt stylesheet for the xml

245
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:06,160
based on the schema of the orchestra

246
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,279
stillow changed the entire digital

247
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:12,480
editorial chain of square journal

248
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:14,560
and here as you can see an example for

249
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:17,600
the new value

250
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:22,719
journal with the

251
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:22,720
stillo html and pdf

252
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,800
for the end still lives in three acts a

253
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,640
proof of concept

254
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:34,719
a unique tool to help scientific

255
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:38,240
publishing and now a piece of

256
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:39,680
other tools like nacala or is there that

257
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:42,959
science

258
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:46,000
to french project

259
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:49,199
if you want some resources you can

260
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:52,480
find here

261
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:53,200
and of course a team with matelo arturo

262
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:57,680
margot

263
00:10:53,200 --> 00:11:01,839
me and many people who work on stero

264
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:01,839
thank you

265
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:17,680
good um journals use a format called

266
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:20,800
jazz do you work with that uh not now

267
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:24,560
it's a it's an option

268
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:29,839
we don't like very much jets but

269
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:29,839
we have to do that yeah

270
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,399
the question is real time collaboration

271
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:41,440
not now

272
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:44,640
it's asynchron okay

273
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:48,560
because it's a very low tech

274
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:48,560
and we don't want to manage

275
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:56,800
too much complexity so it's uh

276
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:59,279
for this year i think we have to

277
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:01,920
for me the real-time collaboration is

278
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:05,680
one of the main reasons why

279
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:05,680
for us too yeah

280
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:11,839
okay thank you

281
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:20,320
what
