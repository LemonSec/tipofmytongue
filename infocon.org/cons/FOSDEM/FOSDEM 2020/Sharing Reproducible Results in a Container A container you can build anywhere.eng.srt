1
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:09,760
it's time for the

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,639
next lightning talk airframe is talking

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:13,519
about

4
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:14,799
reproducible containers in the hpc

5
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:17,920
context

6
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:21,520
thank you okay

7
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:24,080
uh so yes um i came into this really

8
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:27,540
more from the sysadmin side i

9
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:28,839
you know i like making things build i

10
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:31,840
[Music]

11
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:34,559
um i guess i work with the scientists

12
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:36,000
and so they have their you know they

13
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:37,919
have their software and

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,200
need to put it out there for the for the

15
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,879
papers for

16
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,320
other things that they can go and say

17
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:43,280
point would say here it is here you can

18
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,840
see my

19
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,840
my results

20
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,719
okay so i was it was homeworking and so

21
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,280
we got a

22
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:56,719
new app that we were going to go and

23
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,120
host on the website it was being moved

24
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:00,160
from

25
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:03,599
old one to new one so the old website

26
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:06,798
was running on centos 5 with php 5.3

27
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,240
with python 2.7 and another python from

28
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:11,200
the user's home directory

29
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:12,798
and octave also from 2010 and just

30
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:17,600
everything was from

31
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:20,720
2010 just looking and thinking

32
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,720
well tested of course

33
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:27,439
and it also accepts arbitrary files

34
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:30,079
upload whatever you want to it clearly

35
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:33,360
exactly what we want running

36
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:33,919
so i actually went about it using using

37
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,040
geeks

38
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:39,200
so so with geeks yes

39
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:41,439
you tell it exactly what packages go

40
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:44,640
into building each package

41
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:47,679
so you get the reproducibility in that

42
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,479
it works also when you have a collection

43
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,560
of packages

44
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:52,479
every time you install it you get the

45
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,799
exact same packages you don't have cruft

46
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:57,439
from installing and removing packages

47
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:59,200
and it also extends into a whole

48
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:00,398
operating system or in this case into a

49
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,320
container

50
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:04,320
you tell the container i want we tell

51
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,279
geeks i want exactly this inside the

52
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,798
container

53
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,360
and that's it that's exactly what you

54
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:11,680
have inside

55
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,160
so for the web app we have all of our

56
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,000
old software here

57
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,520
and i guess you know going back to the

58
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,959
container uh

59
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,560
what are the scripts i hadn't actually

60
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:23,920
patched all the way

61
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:26,800
you know just missing remove armed or

62
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:28,160
just you know what i didn't tell it uh

63
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,680
where to find it i didn't put it in the

64
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,680
container it just wasn't there

65
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,239
uh so so yeah so had old versions of

66
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,800
graphis of octave

67
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:40,000
all of this coming down to the our final

68
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,239
package

69
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,440
uh so with geeks it was it was easy to

70
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:46,000
go ahead and

71
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,120
to just to create the old versions of

72
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
the packages

73
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:52,319
we started with the version of graphics

74
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,640
that was already

75
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:56,879
already in geeks we changed a couple of

76
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:59,359
things mostly

77
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:01,280
downgrading the inputs to older versions

78
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,120
of them

79
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,879
octave was basically the same thing we

80
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,599
took octave

81
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:08,720
uh you know cue hull had moved around

82
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:10,959
since then

83
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:13,040
gnu lib had moved around since then so

84
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:14,959
just some changes here and there to make

85
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:18,079
everything actually build

86
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:21,120
with older versions of everything

87
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:23,519
and then for the actual container

88
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,599
in pretty much this was the entire

89
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:28,400
config file for the container

90
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:29,599
to find the operating system uh

91
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,879
bootloader doesn't matter it's a

92
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:34,238
container there's

93
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:35,359
no firmware no packages just the actual

94
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:37,680
service itself

95
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:40,959
and the dhcp client so it can actually

96
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,959
find the network that you give it

97
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:46,480
so the service gets fed

98
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:49,518
a service type as a service

99
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:51,518
configuration which in our case was

100
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:54,080
oh you can't see the mouse so here we

101
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:56,400
just have the actual package

102
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:58,400
that i built at the end i told it that

103
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:01,519
it was going to be in the

104
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:04,720
serv http directory with that port

105
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:07,200
uh our little activation script here

106
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,840
really just says uh before you start go

107
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,238
ahead and

108
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,080
run these actions so it was you know if

109
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:15,680
the directory exists delete it

110
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:17,919
then recreate it copy the stuff over and

111
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:21,600
uh it wants to write to the directory so

112
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:21,599
go ahead and make that available

113
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:25,360
and the whole thing was just behind

114
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:28,400
nginx so

115
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:30,240
with the system management

116
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:32,080
uh with the config for nginx it was

117
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,960
really just you know listen on the port

118
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,039
that we

119
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,719
had on the previous slide using the

120
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,880
route that we had on the previous slide

121
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:41,120
from the configuration

122
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:43,360
then uh the service type down here is

123
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:45,360
the one that we actually passed to the

124
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,400
to the operating system config to make

125
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,560
the container

126
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,479
we said you know when you activation

127
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:53,280
service type when you start

128
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:54,639
run the script you're using nginx with

129
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,919
the config that we have

130
00:04:54,639 --> 00:05:02,400
and you know by the way don't

131
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:02,400
make sure that php fpm is running

132
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:10,080
uh building the container was uh

133
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:11,520
you just was the system container

134
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:14,880
command you feed it the

135
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:18,880
actual container file and same

136
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:21,360
serve http folder

137
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,240
directory that we had from before was

138
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,800
actually mounted

139
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,160
in the home directory but we pulled the

140
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:29,360
container you know

141
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:33,120
put it in that spot i wanted the logs

142
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:34,880
and give it the networking and then

143
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,199
uh actually we're running on top of

144
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,479
debian so it was we just used systemd to

145
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:40,479
launch it

146
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:42,719
so we have the same command as before

147
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:43,359
with full path to geeks but geek system

148
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,080
container

149
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,960
full path to the container itself the

150
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,599
same

151
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:51,120
two shares you need the path and give it

152
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,199
the networking

153
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,960
and then just go ahead and launch it the

154
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:58,240
whole thing runs under the

155
00:05:54,960 --> 00:06:01,359
uh bmw user so every so

156
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,560
uh went and you know all the random

157
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,680
files being uploaded were

158
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,240
also owned by it and as far as updating

159
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,000
this

160
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,080
you know every now and then just ran

161
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,759
geeks pull which pulled in new versions

162
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:15,280
of you know not of uh of say graphiz or

163
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:20,080
octave but new versions

164
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:23,198
of of uh php new versions of nginx

165
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:24,719
all the other packages that

166
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:26,240
i didn't have to go and downgrade and

167
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,280
then restarting the service just goes

168
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,160
and rebuilds the

169
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:31,119
the container itself and it's there and

170
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,840
available

171
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:35,039
from the debian uh from the debian host

172
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,359
that the stall was running on we just

173
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:38,719
went

174
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:43,280
and said you know point engine x at

175
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:47,199
you know at port uh was it it was 88.80

176
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:48,960
and we got it from the from the outside

177
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:51,520
so then you know at a certain point in

178
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:53,359
the future when it does go and crash

179
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,639
and i have to go and rebuild the

180
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,919
software

181
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:58,800
uh we have another command i haven't

182
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:00,960
listed here

183
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,240
geeks list generate system list

184
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:05,039
generations

185
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,440
that system you can list the generations

186
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:06,880
from

187
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,400
geeks pulse with geeks polish

188
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:10,319
generations you go back to the previous

189
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:12,560
generation when it did work

190
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:13,840
uh restart the container again and

191
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,120
you're back up and running while you

192
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:19,520
figure out

193
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:19,520
you know just what changed this time

194
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:27,440
so yeah so with that we went and uh

195
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:28,560
we're hosting the old web app using new

196
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:31,360
technology

197
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,639
our new wear technology newer versions

198
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:44,080
of everything

199
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:59,840
and everything seems to be working

200
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:59,840
you again we have time for one question

201
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:09,919
so thank you what's uh

202
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:10,960
the outlook for you uh how will you go

203
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:15,039
about

204
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:17,919
updating now that you have it under a

205
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:18,318
known state so that you can move ahead

206
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:20,960
what

207
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:23,039
are you planning right okay i'd have to

208
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:25,680
repeat the question

209
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:27,599
okay um i'll do it anyway just in case

210
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:30,800
so the question was how do we

211
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:33,919
um how do we update the state

212
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,719
um the actual uh package that we were

213
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:37,838
given

214
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:39,680
um doesn't really get updated

215
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:41,599
it was more of uh making sure that there

216
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:44,800
weren't anything left behind from

217
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:45,120
previous times we restarted it as far as

218
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:48,000
the

219
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:50,240
actual packages that we used to to build

220
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,360
everything

221
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:55,279
we said i had to downgrade gcc to gcc5

222
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:58,080
so that was one of the things that

223
00:08:55,279 --> 00:09:01,600
as we move forward i had to add that in

224
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,600
to make sure that it worked again

225
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:10,720
um

226
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,880
yeah i guess the rest of the dependency

227
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:15,279
graph of everything that was running

228
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:17,200
um more or less uh because it's on top

229
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:19,760
of geeks geeks keeps everything else

230
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:23,839
up to date and then i'm just locking

231
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,839
these versions in at their old versions

232
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:30,800
all right thank you ephraim that

233
