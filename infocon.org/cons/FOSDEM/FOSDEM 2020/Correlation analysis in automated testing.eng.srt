1
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:09,599
thank you very much for coming

2
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:11,679
my name is lukas chiswa i'm here to talk

3
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:12,400
about collation analysis in automated

4
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:15,200
testing

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,200
as you can read

6
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:19,759
at the beginning i want to introduce

7
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:20,080
myself uh tell us something about who i

8
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:24,240
am

9
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:27,038
and uh how the history of my education

10
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,240
moved me to uh such a speck of this

11
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:30,560
presentation

12
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:32,000
formerly i thought about something

13
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:35,280
slightly different but

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,399
uh it evolved in into this then

15
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:40,879
i will tell uh what was the

16
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,160
problem and what the purpose of this

17
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:46,079
research

18
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:48,319
uh i will tell you about some map that

19
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:51,840
stands behind all this thing

20
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:54,879
uh and i will go to the

21
00:00:51,840 --> 00:01:00,559
use cases and some conclusions

22
00:00:54,879 --> 00:01:00,559
uh maybe some anecdote so first of all

23
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:08,640
what was my main purpose

24
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:12,240
i was a former computational biologist

25
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:16,080
bioinformatic i was a person who used

26
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:18,640
very strong supercomputers to simulate

27
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,759
biological biological processes like

28
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:23,200
protein folding

29
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:26,080
in example the

30
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,439
most problematic issue with such

31
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:30,880
research is that

32
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:34,880
very pronounced to any performance

33
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:38,960
issues because there are

34
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:42,158
millions of billions of billions of

35
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:45,039
particles that can be

36
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:46,799
connected to each other in many ways and

37
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,600
can have influence one or two in

38
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:49,600
each other so

39
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:59,439
this is the the performance was crucial

40
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:59,439
and as i started as i moved to

41
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:05,200
informatics to it i started to be a

42
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,800
tester

43
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,280
in 3md app in poland i started to work

44
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,560
with

45
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:16,800
big test suits not

46
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:22,000
very big but big enough to considerate

47
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:25,200
that uh

48
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,560
the the speed of the test the

49
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:32,720
the time that it would be done and the

50
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:38,560
resources consumed are

51
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:38,560
important so i thought about

52
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:46,480
making it some more reasonable to

53
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,840
do some

54
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,359
optimization of these tests

55
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:08,720
and i think that nowadays it's uh

56
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,120
a big team uh machine learning so why

57
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,680
don't

58
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,480
uh have the match that all the tests

59
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,120
learn one

60
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,159
from each other you know if from the

61
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,519
history

62
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:22,799
one test will know that other tests was

63
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:26,959
uh run and almost this

64
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:30,480
exact uh time if some other test failed

65
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:32,879
these days also also failed or if

66
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,560
some other test was run several

67
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:37,760
iterations

68
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,400
and it couldn't reach its expected

69
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,760
outcome

70
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:43,040
the other test would be all either

71
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:46,399
shortened or

72
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:49,200
not done then i realized it was

73
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,640
uh better from the beginning because if

74
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:54,000
tests are correlated

75
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:58,238
in such way the test suit

76
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:01,439
is badly uh created it has some

77
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:01,439
wrong assumptions and

78
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:10,720
the the tests conditions are

79
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:10,720
badly formulated so

80
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:20,400
this is uh my assumption uh

81
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,400
i don't want to read it again

82
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:28,320
i want to make death suits more elegant

83
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:30,160
and save some time and resources

84
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,719
because for the perfect test suit should

85
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,400
be no correlation between the tests

86
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,479
if there are some correlations tests

87
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:40,560
should be i don't know past because

88
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:40,560
we don't need to be made

89
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:46,320
then that that might be that that may be

90
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,320
some um

91
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:52,880
some value measured uh that can

92
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:55,520
even benchmark test suits

93
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,639
the correlation coefficient let's see

94
00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:01,198
for uh

95
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:04,400
for an example there are tests in rows

96
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:07,440
and software versions in columns

97
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:11,599
green is passed and red is

98
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:15,039
failed it seems obvious and

99
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:17,600
i considered tests boolean functions

100
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:22,240
which are true or false

101
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:22,240
normally when you computate a

102
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:28,960
correlation coefficient uh you need to

103
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,560
um do regression first because it's

104
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:34,400
boolean function

105
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:38,080
even from zero to one uh

106
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:40,479
that wouldn't make any sense so what i

107
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:42,479
took was about probability historical

108
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:46,039
probability of passing the test

109
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:47,680
that was the value that i was

110
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:50,800
[Music]

111
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:56,240
measuring if the test is below that

112
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:56,240
probability or above the probability

113
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,400
next uh what i've done um it's obvious

114
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:05,198
that

115
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:07,039
tests that will have 100 percent pass

116
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:08,560
uh doesn't really matter for us uh just

117
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:12,400
the same as uh

118
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:15,039
software version that uh that fails

119
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,440
all the tests you know if we have a

120
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:17,680
power

121
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:19,440
issue at the moment of testing it

122
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:22,639
doesn't truly matter yeah

123
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:26,000
it's not a matter of tests so

124
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:29,280
i i've left only the meaningful

125
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:32,240
test cases meaningful tests that have

126
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,239
sometimes failed

127
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:35,950
and i created a covariance matrix from

128
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,758
them

129
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:41,039
[Music]

130
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:42,319
this may looks suspicious but it's

131
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:44,880
really very

132
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:47,440
easy math it can be done in google

133
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,440
spreadsheets

134
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:53,520
from this i've uh

135
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,318
created a covariance matrix as i said

136
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:57,039
before

137
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:57,919
where on the diagonal is just a variance

138
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:00,318
of each test

139
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:01,440
that is meaningful and the other fields

140
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:02,930
are covariances

141
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:05,599
between the tests

142
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:07,919
[Music]

143
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:07,919
next

144
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,479
i computed the peace and correlation

145
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:17,840
coefficient

146
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:17,840
it may look scary but it isn't trust me

147
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:24,400
and create a correlation matrix what we

148
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:28,400
can see above it's just the shape of the

149
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:29,919
test armor tests outcome that was

150
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:32,239
from the beginning that that was our

151
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:35,680
input and below it's um

152
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:38,800
scattered by me it's only half of the

153
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:40,560
matrix because uh to be clear for a

154
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:43,840
classic clarification it

155
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:45,360
should have on a diagonal one because

156
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:47,039
in each field on the diagonal because

157
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,080
correlation between a test and the same

158
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:50,560
test is one

159
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,919
uh piston condition the coefficient has

160
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,319
um

161
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:55,280
always is always between minus one and

162
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:59,520
one minus one

163
00:07:55,280 --> 00:08:00,638
is uh negative correlation if something

164
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:03,919
passes the

165
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:05,120
other thing fails and uh one is positive

166
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:08,159
correlation if some

167
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,520
phase or passes the other test their

168
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:12,879
value is always the same

169
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:15,280
zero means no correlation and in a big

170
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:16,960
test suit or many tests aggregated in

171
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:20,080
regression

172
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:23,440
the real values are

173
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:24,159
near zero plus or minus per knee zero if

174
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,479
something is

175
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,680
like in this example i i don't consider

176
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:30,719
one because it would be

177
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:33,039
obviously error but

178
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:35,680
0.5 or something like this it is

179
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:35,679
significant

180
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:41,039
we can do that just to validate the test

181
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:44,959
but it wouldn't be

182
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:48,480
much it wouldn't have much value for us

183
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:51,680
what can have value we can

184
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:54,160
with each regression in countless

185
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:55,199
continuous integration continues the

186
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:58,240
delivery

187
00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:00,560
we can test each version and

188
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,519
check the dynamic of changes of this

189
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,640
coefficient

190
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:05,680
you know if we can see that some values

191
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:08,000
that

192
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:10,079
shouldn't be connected seems to be

193
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,040
correlated

194
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:14,640
correlated from some version in the past

195
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:17,439
correlation is

196
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,080
getting bigger with each iteration we

197
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,800
should

198
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:22,320
see a yellow light and check whether the

199
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:25,599
conditions of the tests

200
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:29,680
are prepared

201
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:32,080
correctly this is a real

202
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:34,000
test outcome from we are in the three

203
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:37,519
and the uh maintainers of

204
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:40,399
swiss firewalls uh firmware of

205
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:41,600
pc engines ipo maybe some of you used uh

206
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:44,800
these

207
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:46,560
routers and this is uh from the the test

208
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:50,399
results of the firmware uh

209
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:51,439
of uh one of the lines of the one of the

210
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:54,640
routers

211
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:58,000
um we are maintaining them

212
00:09:54,640 --> 00:10:01,920
for above two and a half year but these

213
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:04,079
tests are not a good example because uh

214
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:05,680
our test suits are evolving too some

215
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:08,800
tests

216
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:09,599
were created and i don't know started to

217
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:13,120
be used

218
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:16,240
half year ago so we have

219
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,560
not completed large enough base of tests

220
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,600
for

221
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:23,199
a long enough history to

222
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:26,000
make this really useful but large

223
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:27,760
silicon vendors or hardware producers i

224
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,200
suppose it could be

225
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:34,319
useful just because

226
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,040
very often cases that one person or one

227
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,920
team is

228
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:39,599
um responsible for one suit in

229
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:43,760
regression

230
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:46,079
all in all they might not be aware of

231
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:48,480
correlations between the regression

232
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:48,479
suits

233
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:56,000
so in the conclusion the dynamics

234
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:57,439
can be useful in a large sets with a

235
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
large history and this

236
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:02,480
is a proof of concept do not consider

237
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,880
this to be a white pipe or something

238
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:09,279
like this

239
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:12,160
idea is quite new and we started to

240
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:13,680
work on this more seriously on our

241
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:16,240
firmware with alpha

242
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:17,279
but this is an anecdote uh squad it may

243
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,519
be some of the

244
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:21,760
some of you know it have heard of it

245
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:24,480
because uh these four sets of

246
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:25,920
data have the same as it's written below

247
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,320
mean of x and

248
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,920
y variance of six and y correlation and

249
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:33,279
so on

250
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:34,800
although they are obviously different so

251
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:38,640
we have to be very

252
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,640
um we have to

253
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:43,359
look uh i i don't consider the

254
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:44,720
statistics to be a red light to be a

255
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:47,200
fail if something uh

256
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:50,480
rapidly uh changes and sometimes is

257
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:54,480
rapidly grow because it may be

258
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:56,750
some from some other reason but

259
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,000
yellow light should be

260
00:11:56,750 --> 00:12:01,040
[Music]

261
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,600
considered visible if something occurred

262
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:11,839
like this this is bibliography

263
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:11,839
and thank you for your attention

264
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:16,010
[Applause]

265
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:28,320
a very similar kind of

266
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:30,720
work can be done using the mutation

267
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:33,040
basic analysis

268
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,639
have you heard of this approach it

269
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,680
sounds very friendly to what you are

270
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:39,120
doing and

271
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:39,120
there you can get

272
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,360
i don't you do you do any computations

273
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:58,479
all the computations i've done

274
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:59,200
in google spreadsheets but thank you yes

275
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:02,800
i heard

276
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:05,360
about it uh but this is a new concept

277
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:06,959
we are just looking for ways that could

278
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:18,320
improve our test suits

279
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:18,319
and i think it should be considered

280
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:35,839
is

281
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:53,760
have not heard that so you should

282
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:56,880
probably mention that

283
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:59,519
there is a thing called mutation testing

284
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,720
yes have i heard about the mutation

285
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:03,839
testing

286
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:06,880
because it can be used it can simplify

287
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:10,480
all the computations

288
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:14,079
that we used here with statistics

289
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:16,720
yes we've heard about it but

290
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:17,680
it's in progress we are looking for new

291
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:21,519
ways to do it

292
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:23,839
and i think it'd be considerate

293
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:23,839
thank you

294
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:41,440
any other questions yeah

295
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:41,439
thank you very much for your attention
