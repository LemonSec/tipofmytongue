1
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:10,879
okay hello everyone

2
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:13,679
um i'm devin i've been a peer-to-peer

3
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:15,200
uh and security researcher for the past

4
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,680
five to six years

5
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,480
and i've also done a lot of devops and

6
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,680
sysadmin

7
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:24,960
work as my day job

8
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:28,840
so this talk is about

9
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:31,920
iot this

10
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:35,600
nice amazing name that everybody agrees

11
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:38,880
on and likes the internet of things

12
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,880
which describes a

13
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:46,160
a series of devices um that are

14
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:49,920
networked

15
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:52,640
uh oftentimes they're sensors but really

16
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,559
it's turning into uh the internet of

17
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,879
things kind of encompasses

18
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:59,358
anything that somebody can plug in uh to

19
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:03,920
the network

20
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:05,280
so what i see iot actually as today

21
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,200
are these devices that people are

22
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,880
putting in their houses so

23
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,960
my father for instance has replaced

24
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:14,000
almost all the light bulbs in his house

25
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,320
with light bulbs that are leds and they

26
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,640
have

27
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,080
esp micro controllers on them that uh

28
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:21,840
connect to his

29
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:23,840
wlan and uh they expose an api

30
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,439
which he can talk to to control his

31
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,840
lights change the colors this type of

32
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:27,839
thing

33
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,920
though even though they're connected to

34
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,280
the local network it's typically

35
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,759
the way that you access and control

36
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:42,399
these devices is through a cloud-based

37
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:44,320
access so a party authentication system

38
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:46,240
and this also allows for nice features

39
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,600
like being able to control and access

40
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,360
your devices from outside the house

41
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,439
which

42
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,720
i can't think of too many use cases for

43
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:53,679
controlling your light bulbs when you're

44
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,920
not at the house

45
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,600
but things like cameras or maybe

46
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,280
remotely unlocking your front door

47
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:02,000
to let somebody in the house that could

48
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,000
be a useful thing

49
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,520
and what iot i think has become

50
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,759
even with all of these interesting

51
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,639
features is a kind of an inefficient

52
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:14,799
system

53
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:17,920
um which obviously is designed in a way

54
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:21,120
that makes data surveillance uh

55
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:22,480
very palpable and useful for the third

56
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,400
parties which are controlling these

57
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:27,760
systems basically being gateways

58
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:30,000
for these devices which are in our house

59
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:31,359
so this is a i see it as a data

60
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,840
sovereignty problem

61
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,280
but it also has further social

62
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,519
implications which i'm going to get into

63
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:40,879
a bit

64
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:41,599
uh first of all it's a user experience

65
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:44,799
problem

66
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:46,879
in the sense that if you want to access

67
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,160
a device that's right next to you

68
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:50,160
and you have to go through a third-party

69
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:52,239
app on your phone which goes to servers

70
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,359
probably in california or who knows

71
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:57,200
where

72
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:59,360
if there's anything in the route

73
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,480
towards these servers or a problem with

74
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,239
the servers themselves

75
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,518
then you're not going to be able to turn

76
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:04,959
on and off your lights or

77
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:06,720
unlock your front door or something like

78
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:10,879
this which is kind of a terrible

79
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:13,519
usability experience compared to non-iot

80
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:13,518
devices

81
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:19,840
we also have the kind of the more

82
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:19,839
obvious one lock in

83
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,798
you end up with any scenarios where you

84
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,840
have multiple devices that span multiple

85
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:27,680
generations

86
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,360
and they're incompatible with each other

87
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,920
and the applications in which to access

88
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,879
them

89
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,958
are completely incompatible due to

90
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:38,159
vendor lock-in and as well as completely

91
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:38,159
different protocols that they're running

92
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:46,000
yeah there have been some interesting

93
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,920
cases where you

94
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,519
spend several hundred or several

95
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:52,798
thousands of dollars

96
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:55,920
putting automation in your home and then

97
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:58,159
the company goes under or

98
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,200
they completely change their system for

99
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:02,480
whatever reason

100
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:04,079
and you have to either buy new stuff or

101
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,359
best case scenario at least upgrade all

102
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,120
of your software before you can use it

103
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,560
again

104
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,760
so that's another terrible user

105
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:14,640
experience especially for the

106
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:16,478
non-technically minded you know

107
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,320
and yeah so the social implications are

108
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:19,519
the i think all the stuff

109
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,680
that i was just mentioning is kind of

110
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:23,280
obvious uh you know

111
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,040
data surveillance surveillance

112
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:28,000
capitalism driving this

113
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:30,160
uh these aren't good things i think most

114
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,680
people here probably agree with that

115
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,280
they're also pretty obvious and that's

116
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,600
probably why a lot of people here

117
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:38,080
opt not to have a google assistant

118
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:41,199
device in their house that type of thing

119
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:44,479
but i think almost

120
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:48,000
to me a more serious problem

121
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:51,120
are these subtle ethical implications on

122
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,440
the social dynamics which

123
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,280
which is that most people aren't even

124
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,639
aware that

125
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,638
they're not talking directly to these

126
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,400
devices in their house or or to the

127
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:02,400
extent in which

128
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,400
they're they're controlled from third

129
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:07,120
parties

130
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,479
and i think that that creates like an

131
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,400
environment where

132
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:11,680
you have like an unwanted guest in your

133
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,120
house and you don't even know they're

134
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:17,039
there

135
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:20,560
and then on another aspect to that

136
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:23,680
is people because of the way that we

137
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:26,160
design these systems to be cloud-based

138
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:30,400
um it doesn't allow for a very

139
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:33,440
um humanistic and social

140
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,799
collaboration between people like if my

141
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:37,280
father for instance with all the lights

142
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,039
in his house when i go to visit him

143
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,559
i can obviously use the switch to turn

144
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:42,960
off and on the lights but if i wanted

145
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,759
to dim or change the color of anything i

146
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,560
can't do it

147
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:49,199
there's no there's no way to add

148
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:51,360
authentication to another person

149
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:52,400
it's it's it's not thinking about the

150
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,960
social aspects

151
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,799
so it's not i think anytime we're

152
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,080
designing systems that people are using

153
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,479
heavily especially for people who are

154
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,719
not

155
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:02,318
technical users first we need to think

156
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,319
about how

157
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:05,919
we're affecting them socially and then

158
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:06,880
how their social dynamics are going to

159
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:09,599
affect the system

160
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,600
designed back

161
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:15,440
so i'm working on this project to

162
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,680
alleviate some of these concerns and i

163
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,400
think we can use peer-to-peer systems to

164
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,720
do that

165
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,479
i think it's the best way moving forward

166
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,000
instead of

167
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:27,919
i really appreciate these projects like

168
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,280
openhab and

169
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:30,960
some other ones where you're running a

170
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,679
server inside of your house that

171
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,318
controls

172
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:36,160
all of these devices and i think these

173
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:38,800
are a great interim solution

174
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,919
but i think moving towards peer-to-peer

175
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,520
key-based

176
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:43,919
authenticated systems is the way to go

177
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,919
forward

178
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,240
so martin did a good job if anybody was

179
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:50,880
in here for the previous talk

180
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,560
about canoona explaining that just i'm

181
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,840
not going to go into it nearly in nearly

182
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,960
as much detail as he did

183
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:59,840
i decided to use this

184
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,840
system because

185
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,240
a highlighted general purpose because

186
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:05,360
the privacy preserving peer-to-peer

187
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,319
networking

188
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:09,759
that's kind of implicit but there's a

189
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:11,199
lot of systems that do this

190
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:12,800
but what i like about ganoona is that

191
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:13,520
it's very general purpose and it's

192
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:17,840
modular

193
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:17,840
and you can pick and choose pieces

194
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,199
here's something that martin didn't have

195
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,360
he had a

196
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:25,440
he had kind of an osi model on the left

197
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:28,560
and then

198
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:31,199
where gnu net matches in but this was

199
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:33,199
created by carlo von links from the secu

200
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:34,800
share and you broke the internet project

201
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:36,400
and this is a little bit of a different

202
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,319
modeling it's coming from the more of a

203
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:40,239
perspective of

204
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:41,759
not an exact one to one how we replace

205
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,360
the osi model

206
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,360
but looking at more of like a paradigm

207
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,720
shift on like how we can think about

208
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,639
designing applications in a different

209
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:52,479
way so you'll see

210
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:55,759
that gnu net cadet and r5n

211
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:57,758
are both options to replace bgp

212
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:58,879
and you have some things that go up the

213
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:00,319
stack

214
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:02,319
they're low level on the gnu that side

215
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:04,080
but they actually end up

216
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:06,879
matching up the stack on the on the

217
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,878
traditional model

218
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:14,159
so what's useful particularly for our

219
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:17,520
project is that gnunet provides

220
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:21,440
a low-level um framework for

221
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:22,560
authentication it has cryptographic

222
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:25,120
primitives

223
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,080
built into the routing and core

224
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,759
networking

225
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:30,479
layers so if you're building an

226
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:32,240
application on top you can

227
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:33,679
kind of take that stuff for granted so

228
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,680
it's it becomes easier

229
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:37,760
you don't have to think about doing key

230
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:40,399
exchanges yourself you kind of

231
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:43,360
can built into your routing if you can

232
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:44,959
route to another device then you can

233
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:48,000
be sure that that device is the one that

234
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:51,040
you're trying to access based off of

235
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,480
the public key um

236
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:55,120
yeah so some of the aspects about

237
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,320
gnunite net that i think are important

238
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,080
for this project or

239
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,240
it's portability because obviously with

240
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,760
iot we're going to be targeting

241
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,560
embedded devices or even

242
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:09,279
microcontrollers

243
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:12,560
for this project we were using open wrt

244
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:15,360
um and uh

245
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:17,760
the work of daniel golly uh an open wrt

246
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,920
maintainer he ported gnunet

247
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,760
to open wrt and you can run it even on

248
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,000
commodity routers it doesn't it's it's a

249
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,560
c

250
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
code based it's very portable it's

251
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,199
modular so you don't have to run

252
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,120
everything you don't have to run the

253
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,560
more cpu intensive peer-to-peer

254
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,720
protocols

255
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:34,959
and nobody's ported it to a

256
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,399
microcontroller yet but

257
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:38,640
it seems like it could be possible for

258
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:41,519
something like the esp32

259
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:43,680
uh also with the net the researchers on

260
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:48,160
ganoona they focus on scalability

261
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:49,519
and just as an aside i think abstraction

262
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,000
level is an important thing to look at

263
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:52,800
when you're

264
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,160
talking about peer-to-peer systems um

265
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,279
some of the most popular peer-to-peer

266
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:58,319
systems right now

267
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:59,200
like um are web-based like secure

268
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,800
scuttlebutt

269
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:04,399
um dat ipfs these things are

270
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,760
probably a lot of people have heard of i

271
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:07,519
think these are great projects i have

272
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,360
friends in all three of those projects

273
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:10,880
and more

274
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,640
but they kind of start on a much higher

275
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:15,839
abstraction level in my opinion

276
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:18,240
uh partially in the language choice

277
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:19,200
on a lot of these but then also in what

278
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,320
they're targeting

279
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:26,560
and i think for iot we have to

280
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,560
to keep the abstraction layer level low

281
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:33,360
so then income secure which martin also

282
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,360
mentioned in the previous talk

283
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:37,200
that's been a research group for some

284
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:41,519
years in uh

285
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:43,920
scalable social interaction models

286
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:45,360
secretary.org you can you can look in

287
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,160
into that more

288
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,440
there's been a little bit of

289
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,399
implementation but it's mostly been a

290
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:53,360
lot of research

291
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:53,360
and documentation it actually started

292
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:00,160
it started out as a meta project

293
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:02,479
and then eventually about five years ago

294
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:04,560
it it kind of

295
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,880
decided to focus on building this on top

296
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:08,560
of or modeling on top of gnu net

297
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:10,000
so it's kind of a general social

298
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:12,560
interaction model based around the

299
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,959
concepts of a social graph

300
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:16,719
a distributed pub sub system and

301
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:19,839
multicast distribution

302
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:21,440
um uh

303
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:23,279
and there's not really any

304
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,519
implementation of this like i said it's

305
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:28,399
it's mostly a research project

306
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:28,880
at this point at least and yeah core

307
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:31,920
point

308
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:34,800
is no central authority in that design

309
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:36,800
uh so with secu share box um that's the

310
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:39,199
name of the the iot project

311
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,959
as a sub project of secure taking some

312
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:44,000
of these research models

313
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:47,359
and trying to apply it to iot we kind of

314
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,360
ended up with two components

315
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:54,959
where one is the iot device side

316
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:56,720
which runs like a which runs gnunet and

317
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:58,638
a daemon which

318
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,000
listens to messaging through a pub sub

319
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:02,399
system so it can

320
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,360
create pub sub channels which you can

321
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:05,440
subscribe to

322
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,560
and then it sends messages which could

323
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:10,480
be sensor data

324
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:13,359
or control messages this type of thing

325
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:15,760
and vice versa and then the second

326
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,760
component is a

327
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:19,360
a command line right now it's a command

328
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:22,079
line interface

329
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:23,200
for the people interacting with it but

330
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:26,079
it's

331
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:28,079
sorry interacting with these iot devices

332
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:31,199
and the the properties

333
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:33,680
um that are important that we found are

334
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:35,839
making it making it offline first so

335
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:37,920
which sounds kind of strange for iot

336
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:39,279
but the idea that you can interact with

337
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:41,599
your database

338
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:43,600
of known devices and your and your

339
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,519
latest information about these devices

340
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,200
even if you're offline you could even

341
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:48,399
send control messages like i want to

342
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:51,200
turn on this light

343
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:53,120
at 6 00 pm but i'm offline right now and

344
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:56,160
then when you get online

345
00:12:53,120 --> 00:13:00,000
it syncs via a pub sub distribution uh

346
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:04,319
system and so

347
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:07,519
uh the the cli it's called boxing

348
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:10,320
kind of looks like this uh

349
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:11,279
it's it's a work in progress right now

350
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,800
um

351
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:14,399
and some of the stuff's being refactored

352
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:16,160
so not all of these commands

353
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:18,800
uh work as of right now if you were to

354
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,800
clone the git

355
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:23,680
but the concept here is that everything

356
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:27,040
you're seeing

357
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:27,760
is effectively local and kept into a

358
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:30,240
database

359
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:32,959
modeled with social graphing so you're

360
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,959
thinking about

361
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:37,120
your relationships to the devices and

362
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,880
the services on the devices

363
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:41,120
so you see here at the top you're

364
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,800
listing your devices

365
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,079
that you know about and these might not

366
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:47,040
all be your devices these could be

367
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:49,359
devices of other people

368
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:52,319
and then you list your services on a

369
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:55,279
specific device which is called toaster

370
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:57,839
and then you see here web server and

371
00:13:55,279 --> 00:14:00,000
then in the parenthesis it's web.toaster

372
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:03,519
so i'm going to get into this a little

373
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:07,680
bit further on the next slides but

374
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:11,040
the the concept is to have pet names

375
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:14,638
uh that are hyper local to you which

376
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:17,360
then are aliases for gns name so the gnu

377
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:19,519
name system

378
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:21,040
which is a part of gnu net which is a

379
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:23,360
key base distributed

380
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:25,360
naming system so we can have human

381
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:29,199
readable names without

382
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:32,320
dns that are

383
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:33,920
directly um correlated with the public

384
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:37,360
keys of devices

385
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:39,040
so so you have kind of like a x 509

386
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,880
authentication built into that system as

387
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,480
well

388
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,079
and then a big component of it is at the

389
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,160
bottom is this

390
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:48,160
idea of giving access control to other

391
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,639
people because that's one thing that i

392
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,199
really

393
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:52,880
saw missing not from all iot

394
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:56,639
implementations but i think it

395
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:59,120
really should be a core aspect and

396
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:00,480
this cli ends up just being kind of a

397
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:04,160
wrapper to the

398
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,160
the existing gnu net modules

399
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:09,120
in the sense that your friend alice is

400
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:13,519
represented by

401
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:16,800
a um a cryptographic key

402
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:21,199
and which we call an ego

403
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:25,279
in gina uh in gnu not rather and

404
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:28,240
you're saying i'm going to allow access

405
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:30,160
via this public key to this device which

406
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,160
is also represented by a public key

407
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:33,680
and what happens there is you push out a

408
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:36,319
message containing

409
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:38,239
alice's public key to the kitchen light

410
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:40,240
bulb device

411
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,440
and since you're already authenticated

412
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,920
with it

413
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,720
it accepts that as saying okay this is a

414
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,959
public key

415
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:49,279
i'm going to now allow access to this

416
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:54,638
service control panel

417
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:58,399
and then when alice tries to connect um

418
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:58,399
it kind of works automatically

419
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:02,959
um so here's a little bit of a graph to

420
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:04,399
go a bit further into it it looks pretty

421
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:08,239
complicated because it

422
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:10,480
kind of is but um if you start

423
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,839
down here in the left corner with user

424
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,959
id 2

425
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:18,560
um they're friends with i

426
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:20,959
uh user id 0 and all these are

427
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:22,560
all all entities on here the the the

428
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:24,959
lighter gray color

429
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,680
are represented by keys the darker

430
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:28,479
grayish

431
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:29,439
beige color is um the relationship

432
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:32,800
between

433
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:36,079
uh the entities so

434
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:38,079
user two is friends with user zero

435
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:39,199
and vice versa user zero is friends with

436
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:42,638
user two

437
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:43,199
they if you look over in the kind of the

438
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:44,959
middle

439
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:46,399
top left you have a device called

440
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:51,040
toaster represented by

441
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:52,959
a public key ego and

442
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:54,719
the relationship between user zero and

443
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:57,359
the device is that

444
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:59,519
they have access to the administration

445
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:03,040
and they are the owner

446
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:03,040
and because of this they can

447
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:08,000
provide authorization to other entities

448
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:09,280
and there are some entities that know

449
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,079
about devices but they don't have

450
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,678
authorization

451
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:15,039
this type of thing so it ends up kind of

452
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:18,079
being like a distributed key value store

453
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:19,359
gns uses a distributed hash table and so

454
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,799
we're really just bootstrapping on top

455
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:22,559
of all that stuff

456
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:24,000
and what's interesting is what i found

457
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:24,959
after designing some of this and

458
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,959
implementing it

459
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:28,240
is that really none of this is super

460
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:29,600
particular to iot

461
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,039
it's definitely useful for that and you

462
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,719
have to think about some of the resource

463
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:35,919
implications

464
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,240
but this is also a really good sysadmin

465
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:37,440
tool

466
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,160
and that's what i've been using it for a

467
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:41,120
lot so i have like a list of my servers

468
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,200
that i connect to

469
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:44,799
for like web servers different things

470
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:48,960
and i've added them as devices

471
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:48,960
and they have different services and

472
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:55,039
then i can connect to them and send

473
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,039
operations to them

474
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:00,640
and then you don't even need things like

475
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:02,879
ssh necessarily

476
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:05,679
yeah so some core components are that it

477
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:08,559
keeps the state local

478
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:09,360
with meaning of your information about

479
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:11,600
devices

480
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,799
services who owns what who your friends

481
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,799
are what

482
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:16,480
authorization they have that all remains

483
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:19,200
local and it pushes it out

484
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,919
opportunistically to the devices that

485
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:23,919
need to know

486
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:25,520
so it's a need to know basis system and

487
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:28,080
some future advancements on that would

488
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:29,039
be syncing between your devices so let's

489
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:32,080
say you have a

490
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:32,960
laptop and a phone uh right now there's

491
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,280
no

492
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,320
concept of syncing the state between

493
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,799
them but that would be something i'd

494
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,960
like to

495
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:41,520
implement and it's a key based system i

496
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:44,799
think i've already covered that

497
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:45,918
that's about it you can look more into

498
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:50,080
it on the website

499
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:56,410
that qr code goes to the top url

500
00:18:50,080 --> 00:19:01,990
and yeah so there we have it

501
00:18:56,410 --> 00:19:01,990
[Applause]

502
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:07,918
do you allow for multiple ownership of

503
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,200
devices like some things that are

504
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:11,200
inherently shared they're not

505
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,720
a one-to-one and because there's a risk

506
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,520
with things like this that you end up

507
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,600
doing the thing you said at the

508
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:17,200
beginning you end up coding new social

509
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:19,039
norms into this world so you think are

510
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:22,559
you thinking about those at all

511
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:24,320
yes uh yes there are scenarios where

512
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:25,360
there is dual ownership and i think that

513
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:27,360
that's

514
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:28,959
that's a reasonable thing to model

515
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:31,280
socially and

516
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,160
yeah so i am thinking about implications

517
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:34,000
like this and one

518
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,919
one for example maybe this kind of

519
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,160
answers it like one thing that i'm

520
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:39,120
specifically avoiding is a trustless

521
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:41,679
system

522
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:43,360
because i i know that some projects

523
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:44,480
peer-to-peer projects are trying to

524
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:46,639
create systems that are completely

525
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,760
trustless and i don't think that that

526
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:49,919
models very well and i don't think

527
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:51,760
that's how humans interact so

528
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:54,000
you can have a with this scenario you

529
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:55,520
could have a device that's owned by two

530
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,480
people and one person kicks the other

531
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:58,559
person off

532
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:00,000
even if it's in their own home of course

533
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:01,039
you could then unplug the device or

534
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,640
something like this

535
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:04,480
but i think that becomes a social matter

536
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:07,840
and we don't need to solve that

537
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,840
in the technology

538
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:10,799
hi

539
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:18,960
thanks for the presentation when using

540
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:20,640
glunets on iot device like

541
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:23,280
sensors and such which are quite low

542
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:25,520
power have you looked into the

543
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:26,639
implications for performance and whether

544
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:29,918
those

545
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:32,320
little devices can run doing that

546
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:34,960
yes um so like i said i would love to

547
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:37,039
see genuine ganonet ported to

548
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:38,720
try try to be at least see if we could

549
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:40,960
port it to a microcontroller

550
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,919
on uh openwrt is where we've done the

551
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:45,280
most testing

552
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:47,200
um there are some

553
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:48,879
there are some components that you can

554
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,360
run with canoe net like network size

555
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,200
estimate

556
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,959
estimation which is useful for having

557
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,400
like very random routes to like avoid

558
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:56,559
censorship and stuff like this

559
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:59,919
but they're very resource intensive so

560
00:20:56,559 --> 00:21:01,918
we disable those things

561
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:03,679
in the images that we have produced like

562
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:04,159
the open wt images that we have produced

563
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:07,679
and

564
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:10,400
what we've seen is that just running

565
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:11,200
just running gnunet for link link layer

566
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:14,080
encryption

567
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:16,000
and the gns system with dht that's

568
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:19,039
reasonable for systems

569
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,400
the size of commodity routers it seems

570
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:21,760
we haven't done extensive testing and

571
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,120
then definitely things like raspberry

572
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:25,360
pi's or anything in that

573
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:27,760
area it seems like it's totally fine

574
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:31,840
it's not super resource intensive

575
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:36,400
yeah oh hi thanks for your talk um

576
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:38,799
i can't hear you hello

577
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,840
ah okay hey uh thanks for your talk just

578
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:41,120
to clarify the

579
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:43,280
published subscribe that you talked

580
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:44,719
about that is part of sorry it's still

581
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:47,200
too hard can you just speak up a little

582
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,840
okay um the publish subscribe that you

583
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,919
mentioned

584
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:51,199
that is part of seek your share not a

585
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:54,559
new net

586
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:56,799
system subsystem part uh

587
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:58,639
is it are you asking if it's a part of

588
00:21:56,799 --> 00:22:00,240
gnunet already okay

589
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:02,000
yeah the publish subscribe system is not

590
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:03,600
a part of gnuna and it's not even fully

591
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,000
implemented in our system yet

592
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:07,918
so uh yeah i don't know if i was totally

593
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,440
clear about that uh

594
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:11,520
everything that i talked about is not

595
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:13,280
fully implemented yet basically just

596
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:15,520
the base stuff and we don't have a

597
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:18,559
publish subscribe messaging mechanism

598
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:20,639
i'm working with a group uh called p2p

599
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:22,799
colab you can see them at p2pcolab.net i

600
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,480
forgot to put their url up here

601
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:26,158
tg is actually giving a talk about that

602
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:28,880
i think next

603
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:31,360
and he's implemented and some other

604
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:34,400
researchers have implemented a

605
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:37,199
distributed privacy preserving pub sub

606
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:41,039
implementation called poldercast

607
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:41,039
which i'm hoping to plug into this

608
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,240
any further questions

609
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:55,840
then thank you for your talk thank you

610
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:55,840
thanks everyone

611
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:58,879
you
