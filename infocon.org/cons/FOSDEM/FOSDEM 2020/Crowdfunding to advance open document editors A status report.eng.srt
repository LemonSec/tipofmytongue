1
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,839
okay

2
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:16,400
good afternoon he says

3
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:17,759
leading me so my name's simon phipps i'm

4
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:20,880
going to talk to you about

5
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:24,560
um what how we keep

6
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:28,840
the prospect of a floss desktop

7
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:30,400
alive so i'll dive fairly quickly into

8
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:33,440
that

9
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,160
so i don't who remembers sunsite anyone

10
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:37,360
here remember

11
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:41,120
sunsite you obviously would but

12
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:44,879
so so many years ago

13
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:47,199
some microsystems gave computer systems

14
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:48,559
to universities across the all over the

15
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,000
world

16
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:51,760
to use that and they were used for

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,239
setting up usenet

18
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:56,000
so if you ever accessed usenet the

19
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:57,919
chances are that if you

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,039
were accessing a service or downloading

21
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:04,559
a file you would go to a sun site

22
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:09,280
and by enabling people to use

23
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:12,720
unix on sunsite some microsystems

24
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:16,960
uh created really the the uh

25
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:18,880
the wave of adoption of unix systems

26
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,240
rather than what have pre been there in

27
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,240
the in the in the past

28
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:24,720
when i was at university which was dec

29
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:27,199
pdp 11's and their successes

30
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,240
and so by making sure that what people

31
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,360
were using

32
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:32,720
for their routine lives was a unix

33
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:35,360
system

34
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,158
that pretty much created the drive to

35
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,439
then use it

36
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:40,640
for research to use it for business

37
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:44,079
applications

38
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:47,280
and this is the origin of the this is

39
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:49,520
the fertile ground in which then the

40
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,520
linux movement grew when linux came into

41
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:55,360
existence

42
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:58,640
um and this is by way of of noting

43
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:02,399
that what people use is important

44
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,399
um let's click there

45
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:08,080
the desktop is crucial everybody is

46
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:11,200
running a desktop of some

47
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:14,480
sort somewhere now

48
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:16,399
uh at the moment i would suggest you

49
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:19,200
that the floss desktop has won

50
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:21,200
it won around about seven years ago

51
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,000
because the desktop almost everyone is

52
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,040
using

53
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,720
is running on linux it's not running on

54
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,319
the local laptop

55
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,319
but it's running on linux on a server

56
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:32,799
somewhere

57
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:33,760
and everyone is using that linux desktop

58
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,720
but that

59
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:39,200
new experience the links desktop isn't

60
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:42,720
creating end user freedom

61
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:44,879
because the use of that linux desktop is

62
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,640
tied to your relationship with whoever

63
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:49,760
the service provider is

64
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,079
now if we want to create a free society

65
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:53,280
we

66
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:55,280
need to make sure that ordinary people

67
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,920
who have not necessarily got the skills

68
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:01,680
to run a server data center of their own

69
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:03,599
have got access to ordinary tools

70
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,879
and if we're going to do that we need to

71
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:07,440
make sure that they are

72
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:08,399
familiar with something other than what

73
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,519
the

74
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,840
the big providers are making available i

75
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:14,800
think

76
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,360
that the floss desktop is essential

77
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,080
because

78
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:20,000
it trains users to want control over

79
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,319
their own world

80
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,080
it creates an environment where

81
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:27,518
developers can use tools that

82
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:28,319
are under their control and it gives you

83
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:30,480
a way

84
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:32,079
to not be under corporate control if

85
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:36,079
that's what you want in your life

86
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:39,360
personally i do now have we got here

87
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:43,519
well open source and free software has

88
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:45,599
been paid for largely by corporations

89
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:47,680
that's because they have typically

90
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:49,760
employed people who either

91
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,360
as their job or as a side effect of

92
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,599
their job cause the software to come

93
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,360
into existence and be sustained

94
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:58,560
typically the way that corporations have

95
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:00,239
funded this is by charging for a service

96
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,879
or by charging for access to the

97
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:05,280
software and

98
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:07,200
that has then allowed them to pay for

99
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,560
development to take place

100
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,439
now the world has gradually been

101
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:16,238
changing and what that's meant

102
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:19,358
uh is that um we're all going to cloud

103
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:21,279
and cloud adoption is if anything

104
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:24,240
driving open source adoption

105
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:25,359
but not on the desktop it's driving open

106
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,520
source in the stack

107
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,360
it's driving open source for containers

108
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,520
and for cloud management

109
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,520
but on the desktop we're seeing desktop

110
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:35,198
tools replaced by cloud tools

111
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:38,159
and those are tools that have no respect

112
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:40,240
for your user freedom

113
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,000
and then there is a there is an even

114
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:45,120
bigger problem with this

115
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,919
because this means that the money

116
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,880
that would uh pay for the floss desktop

117
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:52,719
to be developed

118
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:56,240
is no longer coming into the ecosystem

119
00:04:52,720 --> 00:05:00,039
so people are using all of these

120
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:01,280
components systems and component

121
00:05:00,039 --> 00:05:03,599
sustainability

122
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,198
has got a posse there are people out

123
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,600
there who are making sure that even

124
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:09,600
though business models are moving away

125
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,960
from service contracts for for

126
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:14,720
medium-sized companies

127
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:17,840
there are still ways of funding openssl

128
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:21,759
or libraries or cloud stacks

129
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:24,880
but we have a problem there is no posse

130
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:26,560
for desktop productivity there is no one

131
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,719
who wants to pay for it

132
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,880
and the ability to make money from

133
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,400
desktop productivity software is

134
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,719
is declining it's getting harder and

135
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:37,198
harder to set up a business

136
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,639
that makes money from the existence of

137
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:41,199
productivity software

138
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:42,960
and consequently uh communities like uh

139
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:44,240
the libreoffice community or like the

140
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,159
open office community

141
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,160
are finding that there is there's

142
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,919
negligible investment

143
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,080
because there's no one able to make

144
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:53,680
money from the existence of the software

145
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,440
and so there's therefore no one to

146
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,680
invest in the software

147
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,479
so what are we going to do about that

148
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,400
well um

149
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:02,719
the document foundation over the last

150
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,840
few years has been experimenting with

151
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,560
sustainability

152
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:08,960
and we've had two projects uh that are

153
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,319
of interest in this space

154
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,880
uh the first one i'm going to talk to

155
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:15,280
you about is about djuray standards

156
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,080
and particularly the odf standard and

157
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,239
the second one

158
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,520
is to do with leveraging app stores to

159
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,960
fund development

160
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:23,599
so the first thing to talk to you about

161
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:26,318
is a project that's called cosm

162
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,039
cosm is an acronym that means community

163
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:30,240
of odf

164
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:31,120
specification maintainers now what we

165
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,240
discovered

166
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:36,560
a few years back was that all of the

167
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,400
impetus to create

168
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,080
a maintained version of the open

169
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:43,198
document format standard

170
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:46,880
went away ibm exited the document

171
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:47,759
market lotus gradually declined to

172
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,639
nothing

173
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:52,720
and most importantly that meant that ibm

174
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:55,039
withdrew the editor

175
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,800
who was editing the odf spec and so we

176
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:57,520
went for eight years without a new

177
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,520
release

178
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,680
of the open document format not because

179
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:03,039
no one was interested in it the tc was

180
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,120
still working and there were still

181
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:08,080
improvements and fixes being made

182
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:09,199
but there was nobody to pay for the

183
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,400
standards editor

184
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:12,240
to create a new version of the

185
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:14,159
specification

186
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,840
and so uh we decided to do something

187
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,400
about that and we created the

188
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:20,479
what i think is the first crowd-funded

189
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:22,799
open standards project

190
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:24,318
the document foundation put some seed

191
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:27,440
funding in we put in

192
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:29,199
nearly 30 000 euros of seed funding

193
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,639
and that was structured as a 10 thousand

194
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:33,120
euro grant and then

195
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:35,280
twenty thousand euros of matching funds

196
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,520
for anyone else who wanted to donate

197
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,799
and we successfully got donations from

198
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:41,758
microsoft

199
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:43,280
and from calabrea and from cib and from

200
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,120
the uk government

201
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:47,039
and then in the end from the european

202
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,240
commission and as a result for that of

203
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:50,719
that we were able to

204
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,680
hire a highly respected independent

205
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,639
editor

206
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,520
and he took all the contributions from

207
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:58,639
the tc

208
00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:00,560
and built the odf 1.3 specification

209
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:03,280
that went through the ratification

210
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:06,000
process at the standards body oasis

211
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,960
and it became an official standard on

212
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,680
christmas day

213
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:12,318
on december 25th so there is now an

214
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:14,479
official odf 1.3 specification

215
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:16,000
and the next step in the process is for

216
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:17,840
us to implement it

217
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,280
and so the libreoffice community is

218
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,479
committed to implementing that as soon

219
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,960
as possible

220
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:23,599
i hope it's going to be by the summer

221
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,599
and

222
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:26,878
i'm also i also believe that we'll see

223
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:28,000
that implemented by some other

224
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,759
implementers

225
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,520
microsoft has said that they intend to

226
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,200
implement it and

227
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,799
i'm hoping we can that we'll hear from

228
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,080
google that they intend to implement it

229
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:40,079
as well

230
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:41,919
so odf1.3 which had been uh had been

231
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,159
dead because of a lack of corporate

232
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:45,839
investment has come back to life because

233
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:48,319
a community has got rounded

234
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:49,279
and crowdfunded producing a new version

235
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,440
of the spec

236
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:53,600
we're going to carry on with this work

237
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:56,080
odf 1.4 has got a

238
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,519
feature cut off at the beginning of the

239
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:00,000
third quarter this year

240
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:01,120
and then odf1.4 will hopefully be edited

241
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,920
into a standard

242
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:05,200
with a target of the end of 2022 maybe

243
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:07,680
2023

244
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,720
so we're back on track having a regular

245
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,040
cadence

246
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,959
for the fixing of defects in the

247
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,519
standard and it's a very complicated

248
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,959
standard

249
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:16,959
where people are finding defects the

250
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:18,399
whole time typically they're not the

251
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:19,439
kind of defects that you're normally

252
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:23,040
dealing with they're

253
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:25,279
misplaced misplaced font usage and

254
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,880
incorrect indent and things but they're

255
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:28,320
still considered to be defects by the

256
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,160
standards community

257
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,560
and then there's new work that is taking

258
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:34,399
place that's great that needs to be

259
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:36,319
implemented in the standard so that we

260
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:38,160
have interoperability between

261
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:40,560
different implementations notably

262
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:44,319
between libreoffice and microsoft office

263
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:45,599
or libreoffice and google docs

264
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,600
so that's the first project that we've

265
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,160
worked on the second project that we're

266
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,800
working on

267
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:52,880
is is in progress at the moment it's

268
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:56,560
called the document collective

269
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:57,600
um we kept on running up against the

270
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:00,479
problem

271
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,959
uh within the document foundation that

272
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,079
um

273
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:06,399
it was very difficult to spend money

274
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:07,680
on developing libreoffice because we're

275
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:10,720
a community

276
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:12,399
of developers and users

277
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,880
you don't want to have the foundation

278
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:17,120
which is facilitating the community

279
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,640
competing with the commercial providers

280
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,800
within the community

281
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:22,480
and so working out how to spend some of

282
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:25,680
our quite substantial

283
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:27,279
income on software development proved to

284
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,880
be really difficult we discussed how to

285
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:31,040
do it for years and years

286
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,000
and we kept on getting gridlocked on

287
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,680
things like conflict

288
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,320
of interest questions between board

289
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:37,760
members and so we decided around about a

290
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:41,680
year ago that we would

291
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:45,040
create an independent charity

292
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:46,399
like organization to fundraise and then

293
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,279
spend the money on liver office

294
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:49,519
development

295
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:51,360
and the effect of that work is a thing

296
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:54,720
called the document collective

297
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:56,959
um and so what are we going to do well

298
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,560
these are the this is the outline words

299
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:58,959
we're going to do commercial activities

300
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,640
that

301
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:03,119
complement the community rather than

302
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:04,480
compete with it we're going to try and

303
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:07,519
grow the market

304
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:08,720
for libreoffice and for odf

305
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:10,240
and we're going to try and make sure

306
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,480
that it's self-funded so it's not

307
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:15,440
reliant on charity

308
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:16,000
but what are we actually going to do

309
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,360
well

310
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,360
here's some problem statements we'd like

311
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:22,320
to solve as i said

312
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,519
a tdf and any charity finds commercial

313
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,399
activity challenging

314
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:27,120
the apache software foundation really

315
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:29,279
could never

316
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,320
engage in commercial activity it could

317
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:33,360
never divert

318
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,160
donations to apache into paid for work

319
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,000
by one of

320
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,439
one of the apache foundation's top-level

321
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,120
projects

322
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:44,880
and uh this is especially

323
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:45,680
affects the market that is evolving at

324
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,600
the moment

325
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:49,040
where the motivations of people to pay

326
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,440
contributors in the community are

327
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,719
greatly declining

328
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,480
and then we have another problem that

329
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:57,519
we're facing which is that

330
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:59,839
end users who are the main target of

331
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:01,360
libreoffice are finding it increasingly

332
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:02,639
difficult to install it

333
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:05,839
that's not because there's a problem

334
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:09,120
with our installer that's because

335
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:11,040
microsoft and apple are increasingly

336
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:13,279
locking down installation

337
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,959
they're now requiring signed packages

338
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:16,560
signed in a particular way

339
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:18,719
they're requiring a chain of

340
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:21,199
notarization for the signatures

341
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,800
they're preferring the download location

342
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,959
of their app store

343
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,639
and it it is now the case that someone

344
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,680
downloading something like libreoffice

345
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:30,160
or openoffice

346
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:32,160
if they haven't got technical skills is

347
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:33,279
is finding it extremely challenging to

348
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,199
install the software

349
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:36,959
if you watch the user help mailing lists

350
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,800
for openoffice or libreoffice

351
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:40,800
you'll find that every day there are

352
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,359
multiple questions from end users on how

353
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,599
to

354
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:45,120
install an update to the software that

355
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,920
they're already using so these are not

356
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,519
beginners

357
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:49,439
these are people who already have the

358
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:51,920
software and are trying to install it

359
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:53,920
so we'd like to solve that problem now

360
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:55,120
for a charity to solve this problem is

361
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,439
kind of challenging

362
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:59,200
because the app store is a a hostile

363
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:02,160
commercial environment

364
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:03,760
for a a charity uh for a group of

365
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,839
volunteers

366
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:08,000
the the rules of the app stores are

367
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:09,760
extremely complex and change every few

368
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
minutes

369
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:14,160
you can discover that the filtering that

370
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,120
goes on on the content of the packages

371
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:18,800
results in just arbitrary removal of

372
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,480
your packages from the app store

373
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,719
with the expectation that you have a

374
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,880
developer team waiting to respond to the

375
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:28,079
arbitrary change of rules

376
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,880
and this makes for putting open source

377
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:31,040
software

378
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:32,160
end user software into the app stores

379
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,480
very difficult

380
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:36,319
that's independently of any issues about

381
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,079
the compatibility of the license terms

382
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:40,399
with open source licenses

383
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:41,760
it's just operationally extremely

384
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:44,320
challenging

385
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:45,600
and uh then even if we were to solve

386
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,959
this problem this is a problem for the

387
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,240
document foundation

388
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:50,000
because most of the document

389
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:52,160
foundation's income

390
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:55,040
comes from people making donations while

391
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:56,319
their download is in progress

392
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:58,319
when's the best time to ask for a

393
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,920
donation it's when people have got a

394
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,760
little bit of spare time and are feeling

395
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:03,360
grateful

396
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:05,120
when does that happen well it happens

397
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:07,680
while the 700 meg download

398
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:09,440
is in progress so the document

399
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,479
foundation for a number of years now has

400
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,920
put up a little box

401
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,440
while the download is in progress saying

402
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,560
have you considered maybe donating a

403
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,600
little money

404
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:19,199
and people do but if people were

405
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:21,040
uh downloading from the app store that

406
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:23,680
would not be happening

407
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,480
and so uh that is another challenge to

408
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,399
us

409
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,079
so we want to uh try and do something

410
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:31,920
about those challenges

411
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:34,880
and um that's what tdc is going to do

412
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:36,000
tdc is going to be granted an exclusive

413
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:38,880
license

414
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,079
to the quite valuable libreoffice

415
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,839
trademark

416
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:43,760
and as the agent of the document

417
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:46,160
foundation tdc will place

418
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:48,160
paid for packages for libreoffice in the

419
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:51,360
windows and mac app stores

420
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:53,439
while clearly stating that the uh

421
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:56,079
the same package is available at no

422
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:58,000
charge from the libreoffice website

423
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:59,519
the reason we're doing that is because

424
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,160
we're going to have to spend money on

425
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:02,399
building those

426
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,519
packages specifically for the app store

427
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:06,800
and it's going to be quite

428
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:09,519
quite expensive to do we'll be spending

429
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,719
thousands of dollars on developer time

430
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:14,000
each release

431
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:15,920
and we will also have a an admin burden

432
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,399
of dealing with the app store

433
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:19,920
i i'm i have other i have family members

434
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:21,279
who work in other companies who have

435
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,120
apps in app stores

436
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:25,519
and they tell me they have between one

437
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:28,079
to two people who work full time

438
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:28,720
dealing with the the the detritus that

439
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:31,040
comes that

440
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:33,279
washes back from the app store as they

441
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:35,279
get new reviews of new releases

442
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:37,040
as the rules about what you can say in

443
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:40,079
the listing change

444
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:42,800
as responses to take down requests

445
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:44,560
from competitors come in so we think

446
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:46,319
it's very reasonable to charge

447
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:48,319
we've done some a b testing about what

448
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,759
to charge and

449
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,920
we believe that the right price is

450
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:55,040
around 15 euros

451
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:57,199
and we believe that that shouldn't just

452
00:15:55,040 --> 00:16:00,480
be for one download that should be

453
00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:02,319
for updates for an extended period so

454
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:04,639
this will will be a payment that gives

455
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:06,720
you access to the app store downloads

456
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:08,000
until the next major release comes out

457
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,959
which is a well-known number in

458
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,240
libreoffice world

459
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:13,758
that's about 18 months and so that's

460
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,320
that's a reasonable amount of usage and

461
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:17,040
then we'll

462
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,920
suggest people would like to purchase

463
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,839
the

464
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:21,279
next major version number when it comes

465
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:25,120
out

466
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:26,639
um so how what will we then do with the

467
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,639
money so this is this is where the

468
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:32,959
tricky bit thing comes in

469
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:34,399
um how do you prioritize new features

470
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:36,239
one thing you could do is bugzilla

471
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:39,199
voting now

472
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:40,000
bugzilla has had voting for a long time

473
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:42,959
and

474
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,600
you if you use bugzzilla you'll know

475
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:45,680
that

476
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:47,279
the sophisticated end users spend a lot

477
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:49,040
of their time voting up things that they

478
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:51,600
would like to see fixed

479
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:52,319
they put many many votes into the system

480
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,600
and

481
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,360
the reason they do that is because the

482
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,120
votes are completely free

483
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,639
and there are no consequences to voting

484
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,360
no one is going to come around and ask

485
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:01,839
you to

486
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:03,120
to follow up your vote with some form of

487
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:05,520
commitment

488
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:08,079
um so we're not going to do that what

489
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:10,079
we're going to do is first of all we'll

490
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:12,480
i i envisage we haven't commissioned it

491
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:14,480
yet a plug-in for bugzzilla

492
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:16,160
that will let you promote a feature or a

493
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:18,480
bug from our bugzilla

494
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:21,120
onto a marketplace and you'll be able to

495
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:23,439
do that using your credit card

496
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:24,639
and having promoted a feature into the

497
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:26,400
marketplace

498
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:28,160
then anyone that wants to can come to

499
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,360
the marketplace and vote up

500
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:31,360
the features they would like to see

501
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:33,678
implemented and again

502
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:35,439
you'll be able to purchase as many votes

503
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:38,080
as you wish

504
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:39,120
now i feel this is unlikely to still to

505
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,720
result in an income

506
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,239
enough to pay for the features so this

507
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,600
is not a typical crowdfunding

508
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,919
environment

509
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:47,199
but i am hoping that if we're selling

510
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:49,200
the um

511
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:51,200
if we're selling the packages on the app

512
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,720
store that there will be a substantial

513
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,799
revenue that comes in that will allow us

514
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:56,720
to pay for features

515
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:58,799
and so to sum up what we're going to try

516
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:00,799
and do in just a couple of lines

517
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:02,080
we're going to build a new free software

518
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:05,039
desktop and we're going to get the

519
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:06,320
windows users to pay for it

520
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:09,440
you may have heard that phrase before in

521
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,439
a different context i don't know

522
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:14,080
now that that sounds as unreasonable as

523
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:17,120
it did when it was said by the original

524
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:19,360
president who said it but i think this

525
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:20,719
could actually work so we're going to go

526
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:26,639
ahead and

527
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:26,640
incorporate tdc um we'll skip over that

528
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:31,039
tdc is going to be a separate company at

529
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:33,919
arm's length from the document

530
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:37,120
foundation one reason to do that

531
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:38,960
is because selling any software involves

532
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,678
a good deal being exposed to a good deal

533
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,520
of risk

534
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:43,919
from the software marketplace as soon as

535
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:46,400
you make money you are a target for

536
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:48,559
unwanted activity from competitors and

537
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:50,559
from patent holders in particular

538
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:52,320
and so we want to contain that risk and

539
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:53,840
make sure that the document foundation

540
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:57,200
is not impacted by it

541
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:58,480
so tdc will be a separate entity but

542
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,919
we also don't want it to make it a

543
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,520
separate commercial company that could

544
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:04,000
go off the rails

545
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:05,840
so we're going to use a community

546
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,440
serving business structure

547
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,879
that does not have shareholders does not

548
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,240
have a beneficial owner so there's no

549
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,720
way to distribute any

550
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:14,960
any surplus in the form of dividends or

551
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:16,720
other payments upstream

552
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:18,480
it's going to have it's going to be a

553
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,600
commercial operation with a small board

554
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,200
of directors

555
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:23,520
who will be compensated for their

556
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:26,000
contributions to the degree that they

557
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:27,918
contribute and it's going to be

558
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,320
incorporated using a regulated vehicle

559
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:32,000
so the bylaws can't be changed

560
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:34,159
my chosen vehicle because i live in the

561
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,840
uk is a community interest company in

562
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:37,760
the uk

563
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:40,080
there don't appear to be any bad

564
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:41,679
consequences of brexit from doing this

565
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,280
because all of the interfacing to the

566
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:47,280
rest of the world will be through

567
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:49,120
the microsoft and uh and mac app stores

568
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:51,600
and the contractual relationships

569
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:53,280
outbound with contractors to do the

570
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:56,000
feature implementations

571
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:57,678
i i'm trusting that uh spending money on

572
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,200
it contracting is not going to be made

573
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:00,880
impossible by brexit although

574
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:03,120
who knows just how crazy it will end up

575
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,120
being

576
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:07,120
the only control line if you will back

577
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:09,360
to the document foundation

578
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:11,199
is the commercial trademark license and

579
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:12,320
so the document foundation will if we go

580
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,840
off the rails

581
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:15,520
we'll be able to say you can't use that

582
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:17,918
name anymore

583
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:19,760
and i believe that that is going to

584
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:21,200
would be a significant disadvantage if

585
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:23,120
we were not able to call the packages in

586
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,720
the app store libreoffice

587
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:27,280
because it's very hard to distinguish

588
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:31,039
yourself from the large number of other

589
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:31,039
packages that are in that store already

590
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:37,360
okay so

591
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:39,120
what we're going to do next well we're

592
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:41,280
ready to incorporate

593
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:43,918
i'm just writing the uh the cic

594
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:45,678
statement and the bylaws at the moment

595
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:47,200
we've got a steering group that the tdf

596
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:50,720
board has appointed

597
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:52,799
and i'll ask them to appoint a

598
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:54,799
ceo and a set of probably three

599
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:55,360
directors to steer the next stage of the

600
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:56,559
company

601
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:58,158
and at that point it will be

602
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:59,520
commercially staffed and operated and

603
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:02,400
floating free

604
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,960
from the document foundation the working

605
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:06,080
title is

606
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:08,480
the document collective hence tdc

607
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:09,678
everyone seems to like that name and so

608
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,799
that's probably what we'll call

609
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:13,039
ourselves

610
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:15,360
until it proves to be bad for some

611
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:17,600
reason

612
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:19,280
now i think these these are this all

613
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,719
sounds very basic and straightforward

614
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:23,120
when i explain it

615
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:25,440
um and there is some work in the market

616
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:28,559
already in doing similar things so creta

617
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:30,240
and vlc have also leveraged app stores

618
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:31,678
to create revenue from their communities

619
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,600
very successfully

620
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:35,840
the main innovation in here i think will

621
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:37,439
be doing that and then coming up with a

622
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:38,639
community driven way of spending the

623
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:41,280
money

624
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:42,000
and i'm very hopeful that that will end

625
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:44,639
up

626
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,600
being a positive experience as well if

627
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,679
you don't agree

628
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:50,480
my email address is down here you're

629
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:52,400
welcome to to let me know about it

630
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:54,320
when we eventually launch which i hope

631
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:56,799
will be the middle of the year sometime

632
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:58,720
i would love it if you would help with

633
00:21:56,799 --> 00:22:00,879
the inevitable questions

634
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:02,559
uh i know the very first question that

635
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:04,400
will come up on slashdot is you can't

636
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:05,918
sell free software

637
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,200
and so if you would like to be the

638
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:10,240
person that answers that question on

639
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:11,360
slashdot i'd be very grateful

640
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:13,360
so that's everything that i was going to

641
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:16,158
say to you uh we have

642
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:17,678
uh four five minutes for questions does

643
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:20,720
anyone have any questions

644
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:23,600
questions um

645
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:24,400
you you have said windows will pay for i

646
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,799
mean you can

647
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:28,799
trade windows or apple yes i know ankit

648
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:29,600
project for example they do that same

649
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:32,960
thing and they

650
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:33,520
let i think they generously pay apple

651
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:36,559
users

652
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:39,440
so the concept is working but

653
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:40,158
do you think can we also be done on

654
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,640
linux

655
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:43,840
i mean ubuntu or for example try to have

656
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:47,039
some app store

657
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:50,000
and there's a popular i think

658
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:50,000
widespread thing

659
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:55,840
also so i think i don't think it's going

660
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:57,760
to be likely to be useful on linux

661
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:59,840
what we're really charging for is the

662
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:02,000
convenience of not having to work out

663
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:04,158
how to install the package

664
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,840
and that that need doesn't exist on

665
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:08,080
linux it's you know installing

666
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:09,760
installing libreoffice is extremely easy

667
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,080
i i've even done it on my chromebook i

668
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:13,120
mean

669
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:14,559
you know so and

670
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:16,320
there's no point trying to create the

671
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:18,960
artificial scarcity

672
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:21,120
so i now i hope linux libreoffice users

673
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:22,720
will continue to make donations

674
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:24,799
and that would be very handy because the

675
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:26,559
document foundation does need

676
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:28,240
a certain amount of money to continue

677
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:29,600
doing its administration and to pay the

678
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,760
admin staff

679
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:34,639
so we do want money to continue to flow

680
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:37,360
into the document foundation as well

681
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:38,640
and it would be great if we had uh linux

682
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:40,399
users contributing there

683
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:42,320
to be honest with you linux users are

684
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,600
not the dominant contributors to the

685
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:46,480
document foundation's

686
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:47,918
income uh even at the moment most of our

687
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:51,200
income comes from

688
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:53,679
the proprietary platform users and so

689
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:55,200
if anyone's got ideas for uh ways to

690
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:56,559
encourage the linux community to

691
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:59,520
contribute more

692
00:23:56,559 --> 00:24:00,960
financially we're very happy to get

693
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:03,279
contributing kind as well

694
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:04,000
so document foundation has got a large

695
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:06,320
and vibrant

696
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,080
and active community and there's there's

697
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:10,960
plenty of entry points

698
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:12,480
to to work on the code but honestly most

699
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:13,120
linux users who have libreoffice

700
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,919
installed

701
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:17,279
don't want to work on the code they want

702
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:19,279
to work on the invoice

703
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:20,480
with it rather than with some co on some

704
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:23,279
code um

705
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:24,960
so for those people if it will be if a

706
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:25,760
way to encourage donations would be very

707
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,760
welcome

708
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:28,640
and there's there's there are tdf staff

709
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:30,080
in the room who will take your

710
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:31,200
suggestions

711
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:33,840
i don't think any of them can take your

712
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,840
credit card

713
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,639
and i don't know if it's the perfect

714
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,760
solution

715
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:51,919
but why can't i go to the lpe europe

716
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:54,240
venus professional and say hey i would

717
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:57,919
actually also like to have a

718
00:24:54,240 --> 00:25:00,240
linux document foundation certification

719
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:00,240
exam

720
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:06,158
so i think that would be a great thing

721
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:07,360
to do so um

722
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:09,120
so one of the things that happened when

723
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:11,120
we were discussing this on the board is

724
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:12,719
once we had established the idea that

725
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:15,199
maybe it was a good idea to have a

726
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:16,400
an arms length commercial entity people

727
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,480
started saying well

728
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:20,000
we we could do this as well now why

729
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:21,120
don't we get that entity to run the

730
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,159
conference

731
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:26,320
why don't we get that entity to uh to

732
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:28,159
pay the staff who don't work in germany

733
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:31,200
why don't we get that entity to

734
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:33,679
uh and to run certification exams

735
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:36,080
i i'm not at all opposed to that idea

736
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:38,480
i'd just like to make this work first

737
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:39,199
and and then move on to some other

738
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,880
things if the

739
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,720
if if the overall community thinks

740
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:44,080
that's a good idea

741
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,919
i don't think everything ought to be in

742
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:47,520
an arms length entity so i disagree with

743
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:49,360
employing staff from there for

744
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:50,799
the staff that aren't working for tdc

745
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:53,279
from there for example

746
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:54,400
but i could see paid certification exams

747
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:55,600
i mean that's working very well for

748
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:58,720
linux foundation

749
00:25:55,600 --> 00:26:01,760
who have a lot of

750
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:05,039
red hat well they're a little different

751
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:06,320
because but it's the the model i would

752
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:08,240
try and pick up would probably be the

753
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:10,000
linux foundations model and i'd probably

754
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:11,039
want to partner with lpi to do the

755
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,880
content

756
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:14,559
and i'd probably want to get tdc to try

757
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:16,480
and uh

758
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:17,918
arrange for there to be training and

759
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:21,440
exams around the world but that's that's

760
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:23,679
a way out you know 2022 2023 please

761
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:25,679
one at the moment we don't even have an

762
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:27,200
employee

763
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:28,640
so let's let's i'm going to get this

764
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,520
fixed first hopefully this is going to

765
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:32,320
work

766
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:33,760
hopefully it will will be successful i

767
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:37,678
think we'll know

768
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:39,520
by the middle of 2022

769
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:43,200
i think that's kind of when i would want

770
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:43,200
to say well shall we do some more things

771
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:48,960
and then i can do or either i can do the

772
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:52,080
talk at a related fosdem about what a

773
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,080
terrible failure it was

774
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:58,320
by then i will have retired and and um

775
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:00,880
you know i'll be able to

776
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:02,080
do a retrospective on my successes and

777
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:04,799
failures

778
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:06,158
um okay we could take one more question

779
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:10,158
as the room changes

780
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:14,640
anyone else want to do anything olivia

781
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:18,799
the customer the windows user will see

782
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:18,799
a full package of library offices

783
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,159
no they will just see the same package

784
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:24,240
that's on the way on the libreoffice

785
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:26,000
website

786
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:27,919
now it won't actually be the same

787
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,240
package because to make it

788
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:32,559
work on the app store we have to do some

789
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:34,559
sandboxing of some of the capabilities

790
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:35,760
and we have to do we have to sign it

791
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:37,440
differently

792
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:39,039
but when you start it up it'll have the

793
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:40,640
same splash screen it'll have all the

794
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:42,480
same functions and features

795
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:44,559
and it will look just like the identical

796
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:46,880
product that's on the store

797
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:48,240
and our goal is to have it be released

798
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:51,360
at the same time

799
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:53,039
as the as the main packages and our goal

800
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:56,399
is also to have it promoted

801
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:59,520
by tdf as the official build

802
00:27:56,399 --> 00:28:01,678
for uh users who would

803
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:03,840
rather have installation maintained for

804
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:03,840
them

805
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:17,840
okay over to call thanks very much

806
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:20,639
you
