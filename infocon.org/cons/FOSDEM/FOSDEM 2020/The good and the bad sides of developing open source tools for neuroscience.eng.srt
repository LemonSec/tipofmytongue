1
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:08,880
so good morning everybody i think it's

2
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:12,320
about time to start

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,759
um my name is jan grave i'm from the

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,360
institute for neurobiology from the

5
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:16,960
university of tubingen

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,279
and i'm so basically i am a

7
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:22,960
neuroscientist and on on half

8
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:25,439
time or spare time i'm an

9
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,320
um part-time developer for open source

10
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:28,400
tools so

11
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,679
i want to talk about the good and the

12
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,320
bad sides of

13
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:33,440
developing such tools for neuroscience

14
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:37,040
and

15
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:40,239
give you my ideas about

16
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:42,320
these things right so

17
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:43,760
we start off with something that is kind

18
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,160
of serious or has become

19
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:48,800
serious in scientific community this is

20
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,760
the reproducibility crisis and i picked

21
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,839
a few

22
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,920
older papers that that show these

23
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,600
effects quite quite nicely

24
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,239
so there's one paper sorting out the

25
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:00,559
facts the devil in the details these

26
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:03,280
is a paper or short comment by two

27
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:05,679
laboratories who try to reproduce

28
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,880
their respective results so they're

29
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:10,320
working on the same

30
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:13,280
thing same methods but they come up with

31
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,880
different results and and the striking

32
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,320
sentence out of this paper

33
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,320
is our two laboratories quite

34
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:21,600
reproducibly were unable

35
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:23,279
to replicate each other's cell sorting

36
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:26,320
profile

37
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,720
and they really took the time to try

38
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:31,360
and figure out what is the problem here

39
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:33,679
and it boiled down to something like

40
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,960
it is a tiny detail in some protocols

41
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,640
hidden somewhere

42
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:39,199
and this information has never been

43
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:42,880
noted somewhere

44
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:46,479
the second thing is the gene

45
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:50,000
or genetics group is rather

46
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:54,000
advanced with respect to data sharing

47
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,799
tool sharing etc but even there

48
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,520
it is tricky to replicate studies right

49
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,640
so

50
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:03,520
in this paper they try to replicate

51
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,560
um results by using stuff that was

52
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,039
published in the

53
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,080
public database and the striking finding

54
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,399
here again is

55
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,520
the authors replicated two studies in

56
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:14,640
principle

57
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,080
six studies partially and ten could not

58
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:19,599
be reproduced and they

59
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:22,239
found out so the main key was

60
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:24,319
the iron unavailability of the relevant

61
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:26,160
data and metadata is the key point that

62
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:29,760
hinders you

63
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:32,720
so we do have a problem

64
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:34,239
with reproducibility in science so and

65
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,800
it seems that information

66
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:37,920
background information metadata data

67
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:41,519
about data is

68
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:43,040
is the problem here and the issue is

69
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:45,360
that some information

70
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:47,040
is hidden somewhere in let's say

71
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,959
handwritten notebooks

72
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:52,480
and if somebody's supposed to read my

73
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:54,319
notes i think he has a hard time

74
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:56,000
other information is hidden within

75
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:59,359
settings and properties of the used

76
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,360
hardware or software

77
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:04,319
some is implicit knowledge that is

78
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,360
somewhere hidden in lab traditions right

79
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:10,399
this doesn't even show up in lab books

80
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:12,879
so i think that open source tools and

81
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:15,040
standardization might play a key role

82
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:18,079
to solve these issues and to overcome

83
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:20,720
these reproducibility crises

84
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,920
before i go into our open source tool

85
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:25,120
development stuff

86
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:26,879
i want to talk a few a little bit about

87
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,879
what we do scientifically

88
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:30,079
so as i said i'm from the department of

89
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:32,159
neurobiology

90
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:34,319
and more specifically we are

91
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:36,640
neuroethologists that is we mean

92
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:38,560
we intend to understand how the brain

93
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,238
processes information

94
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,680
in the context of the animal's own

95
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:45,280
behavior and our

96
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:47,599
favorite study system is the e-fish or

97
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,200
electric fish and these creatures

98
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:51,040
produce an electric field that the

99
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,839
surrounds themselves

100
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,879
and they use it for prey detection

101
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,040
navigation

102
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:59,120
as well as communication i will just

103
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:02,000
briefly skip over these things

104
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,120
but we can use this field go into the

105
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,599
wild

106
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,799
put a lot of electrodes into a river

107
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:10,560
which is the

108
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:12,319
bluish line here and then record the

109
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,959
electric fields and figure out where

110
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:15,599
these animals are and this is shown by

111
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:19,040
the

112
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:20,560
by the three different dots here

113
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,560
and each individual has its own

114
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,280
frequency so we can track it over time

115
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,360
and space

116
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:28,239
which is cool because we then can find

117
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:30,639
out how and who is talking to whom

118
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,960
or interacting with whom and finally we

119
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:36,320
can go and try to analyze the

120
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:38,479
really the signals and see so each line

121
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:40,560
here is an individual animal

122
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:42,000
and they usually keep as constant

123
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,240
frequency so the spectrogram

124
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,080
shows time on x-axis and frequency on

125
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,919
y-axis

126
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,359
and they keep it constant except there's

127
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:50,880
something happening let's say an

128
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,639
interaction with a different one

129
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:55,120
so they can produce communication

130
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:55,120
signals

131
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:59,039
the second part of our lab is working

132
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,560
with

133
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:05,199
the brain itself so we record

134
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:07,120
the activity of nerve cells that process

135
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:09,280
this information

136
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,880
in response to something like like a

137
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,000
communication signal don't look at the

138
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,800
details it's just

139
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,240
we record action potentials and see how

140
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,320
do they encode

141
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,639
this communication signal information or

142
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,919
we do something like system analysis

143
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:24,560
like we play

144
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:25,359
tricky white noise stimuli and and and

145
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,280
figure out

146
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:30,639
what range in frequencies can they

147
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,638
encode and how do they do it

148
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,639
with this i come to to the tool chain

149
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:37,198
that we use and this is

150
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:39,680
almost entirely based on open source

151
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:42,320
some of these tools we

152
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,960
we produce ourselves so there is the

153
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,039
recording

154
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,960
side we use the tool that is called

155
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:50,639
relax for recording

156
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:53,919
we store information in open formats

157
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:56,160
like like the next tool or odml

158
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:57,039
we use different tools for data

159
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,000
management

160
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:03,360
this is data joint or the gen platform

161
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:06,720
developed by the gnode here

162
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:10,160
and of course we use open source

163
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:12,560
in during our analysis and and and the

164
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:15,680
code management let's say

165
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,160
let's go to the data recording site so

166
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,479
our

167
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,199
our tool is is relaxed it's it's self

168
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:23,680
written

169
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:26,639
by a bunch of people the main

170
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,919
maintainer or developers is is the head

171
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:31,199
of our group

172
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:34,240
um so what we do with this is we record

173
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:34,639
several signals we store them we filter

174
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,520
them

175
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:38,400
we extract events like communication

176
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:41,359
signals

177
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,840
we extract events like action potentials

178
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,680
and store

179
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,039
all these things so and we we run

180
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,280
protocols like

181
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:48,318
for example for a basic characterization

182
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,719
of the neuron we

183
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:52,319
record how does it respond when we

184
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,560
increase the stimulus intensity

185
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:55,759
what we call an fi curve and as you can

186
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,520
see

187
00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:00,240
this is the dialog that allows you to

188
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:02,400
set all the features of the protocol

189
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,680
and this is kind of diverse so i can

190
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,479
change it on the fly

191
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,840
when i think this is i need to adjust

192
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:11,520
the settings to that

193
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:14,560
neuron that i just record um

194
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:16,560
or we have some other information that

195
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,720
needs to be stored

196
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:21,120
let's say information about the the the

197
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:24,400
subject that was recorded or the cell

198
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:26,160
so relax in itself is super flexible

199
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,679
since we created our own we have the

200
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,960
full control over it

201
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:32,800
we can extend it by producing

202
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,960
what we call research protocols or

203
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:37,280
repros

204
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,719
and we can customize it and we can

205
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:41,840
change flexibly

206
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:44,000
or on the fly or even automatically what

207
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:46,960
the stimulus parameters will be

208
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,879
adapted in a so-called closed-loop

209
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:51,440
fashion

210
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:52,960
and it features an in a hardware

211
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:55,520
abstraction layer

212
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:56,000
and real-time functionality and these

213
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,440
are two

214
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:02,800
two things i want to talk about in a bit

215
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:05,520
and the thing is it knows already a lot

216
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:07,280
about the settings and the properties

217
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:10,799
that we need to store

218
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:13,280
along with the data to have it

219
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,280
reproducible or at least that we can

220
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:17,840
recreate the conditions under which we

221
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:21,119
were recording

222
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:22,479
so does that mean that everything is

223
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,280
cool

224
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:26,400
not really there are certain drawbacks

225
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:29,359
here

226
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,960
the code base is extensive and the

227
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:34,000
abstraction levels

228
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:36,000
make it hard for people that come into

229
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,559
our lab or people that want to use that

230
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,799
software

231
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:42,079
to really jump in and create something

232
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:42,079
they of the on their own

233
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:45,920
the whole software thing is maintained

234
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:49,040
by a small team

235
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:51,839
and they all to some extent depend

236
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,719
on the main developer and this is to

237
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:55,760
some parts

238
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:57,200
due to lack of documentation which is

239
00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:00,560
due to lack of time

240
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,560
basically and

241
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:04,399
we also depend on some third-party

242
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:07,760
software so the whole thing is

243
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:09,519
cute based we use a

244
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:11,120
two libraries i want to talk about the

245
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:14,720
comedy library and the

246
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,720
rti library

247
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,600
and this leads us to some issues with

248
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,920
our dependencies

249
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,959
so for example the comedy library which

250
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:26,160
is great is this

251
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:27,359
it's a linux interface for data

252
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,040
acquisition hardware

253
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,880
so the boards that we have in the

254
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:33,279
computer that transform the

255
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,480
analog signals from from our recording

256
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:36,560
electrodes

257
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,800
to something digestible by by the

258
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:41,839
software

259
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:45,599
but it is only run by a handful

260
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:47,279
of maintainers and the hardware support

261
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,040
depends on some extent on the hardware

262
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:51,760
manufacturers

263
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:53,760
and some hardware support is is

264
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:56,240
therefore outdated so i just ran into

265
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:59,839
the situation that i thought

266
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:03,120
i i need to buy a new card a new new

267
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:03,760
data acquisition board and and i looked

268
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,279
at the co

269
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,959
at the documentation and see oh yeah

270
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:09,600
it's supported everything's cool

271
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:11,680
but actually the support is so outdated

272
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:14,720
it doesn't work anymore

273
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:15,040
good side i can address the guy who did

274
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,680
it

275
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,560
and ask him and hopefully reactivate him

276
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:21,760
to to

277
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:24,479
add the support the second thing is the

278
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:26,079
archive library which is an interface

279
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,680
for real-time processing

280
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:29,279
and it's maintained by a really really

281
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:32,399
small team basically it's

282
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:36,079
it's one lead maintainer

283
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:39,680
who is a professor an engineer i think

284
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:41,279
but he has of course oops very limited

285
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:44,880
time

286
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:48,320
what happened here i don't know so

287
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:48,320
this makes things really hard

288
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,040
i don't know okay so what we do

289
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:57,279
do we learn from doing this kind of

290
00:10:55,040 --> 00:11:00,160
stuff we develop our own software that

291
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:02,160
keeps us very very flexible

292
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,680
the code is open to everyone so can we

293
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:06,079
can go back and check

294
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:08,640
uh how things were really done and and

295
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:11,439
figure out if there were issues

296
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:13,360
relax and some of its dependencies are

297
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,680
maintained by only small teams

298
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:17,120
that makes it critical but it's only a

299
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:20,800
free time

300
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:21,440
thingy and getting people involved is

301
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,079
really hard

302
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,360
so this is something whenever we hire a

303
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:29,040
student to work on

304
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:30,880
pieces of it it's really hard

305
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:33,120
and the neuroscience community so we

306
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:35,519
have some users outside of our lab

307
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:37,440
but they find it really hard to get

308
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:38,000
accustomed with open source processes

309
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:42,079
like

310
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,920
sending a put or to say to them

311
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:47,359
uh oh yeah implemented send a pull

312
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:49,519
request is something they don't accept

313
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,800
and the final thing which is leads me to

314
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:53,760
my second point is

315
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:56,160
we need flexible solutions for data and

316
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:59,839
meter data storage since our tool is

317
00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:03,680
completely open to changes every time

318
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:06,160
so the second part is flexible recording

319
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:08,239
requires flexible storages and this is

320
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:10,240
some efforts that we do together with

321
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:12,240
the german neuroinformatics node

322
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:14,240
and the team is slightly larger i

323
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,560
highlighted the ones who are

324
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,079
most active but this is not entered

325
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:21,760
through all the time

326
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:24,399
and we did two two

327
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:26,720
projects one is called odml it's for

328
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:28,480
storing arbitrary metadata in a in a

329
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:32,000
hierarchical format

330
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:34,480
and the other one nyx is to

331
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,720
a format or a data model actually to

332
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,160
integrate data and metadata storage and

333
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:41,519
i want to talk about mix

334
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:41,519
for a few seconds

335
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:47,920
so the core idea behind this is to

336
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,480
generate or come up with a generic data

337
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:51,839
model

338
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:53,839
that allows to store n-dimensional data

339
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:55,920
irrespective of what the data is so it

340
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,240
can be doubles it can be floats it can

341
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:59,839
be

342
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:02,160
whatever boolean strings

343
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:03,760
and we want to be able to highlight

344
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:06,719
regions and points of re

345
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:08,480
or of points of interest in in this data

346
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,560
further we want to be able to annotate

347
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,800
it with arbitrary metadata

348
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:14,399
in principle down to the single data

349
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:16,560
point that we record

350
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:19,440
and one of the core ideas that's that

351
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:21,518
the entities carry just enough

352
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,880
information that we can draw a basic

353
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:24,959
plot of the

354
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:26,399
of the data without any additional

355
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:28,479
sources

356
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:31,040
so how does that look like this is a

357
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:32,240
little bit a part of the data model that

358
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:35,279
is behind it

359
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:37,839
so the key element is what we call the

360
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:40,800
data array it stores this information

361
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:43,360
and it stores information about what is

362
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:46,160
in there what is the unit of that stuff

363
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:48,000
of course the data itself and then we

364
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:50,719
have something that we call dimension

365
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,079
descriptors that describe this time axis

366
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:55,839
at this point here

367
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:58,319
or anything else and then we can have

368
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:59,279
entities that are called tags that allow

369
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:03,760
us to tag

370
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:06,399
regions or points in this data

371
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,040
to make us independent of of so we don't

372
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:09,199
want

373
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,959
we don't only want to store time

374
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:11,439
dependent information but it could also

375
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:13,040
be

376
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,720
something like a dimension could be

377
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:17,519
something like space or so

378
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:19,519
so we have we have an abstraction there

379
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:23,279
we have dimension descriptors

380
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:23,680
uh and i think i will kind of skip over

381
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,439
them

382
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:27,279
they are meant for different purposes

383
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,600
something that is regularly assembled in

384
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:29,680
time

385
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:32,800
something that is not regularly sampled

386
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:35,760
in time and this drives me nuts

387
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,760
i don't know what's gone

388
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:44,240
okay so

389
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,360
as i said we want to be able to tag

390
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:47,519
points and regions

391
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:50,160
and this is shown here so basically we

392
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:52,079
have the data which is the blue line

393
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,600
as a function of time and we can just

394
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:56,399
store from where

395
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,040
to where do we want to tag things and

396
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:59,279
this

397
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,800
does not only work in 1d but also of

398
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:04,079
course in 2d

399
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:07,040
or multiple regions in in

400
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:10,160
basically n dimensions and with this we

401
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:12,880
can create the new entities we can have

402
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:14,800
this data stored somewhere we can have

403
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:17,040
the information for the events

404
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,959
somewhere else and we can combine it to

405
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:20,800
something we detected events in that

406
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:24,319
signal

407
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:26,240
right and the issue is we are working

408
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:28,800
with linux

409
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,759
we are working or happy are happy with

410
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,680
working with c

411
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:33,519
plus libraries but not all the people

412
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:36,719
are happy with this

413
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:38,959
so we thought behind this project it

414
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:41,279
would be nice that we have a

415
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:42,079
we have a core library that is in c plus

416
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:44,320
plus

417
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:45,519
and the data can be possibly stored in

418
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:48,160
different backends so

419
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:49,120
far we only support fully the hdf5

420
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:52,240
backend

421
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:53,839
most of you might know it uh

422
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,440
but we are a small team so we thought it

423
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:56,880
might be a great idea that we have this

424
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,600
common library here

425
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:00,880
and just maintain language bindings for

426
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:04,000
python matlab

427
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:05,279
java whatever but this turns out to be

428
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,680
really tricky

429
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:08,880
and actually the user is supposed to use

430
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:12,399
something that is

431
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:15,040
an a specification of the abstract model

432
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:16,240
to something that is domain specific and

433
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,759
as you can see

434
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,920
it's really hard for us it's really

435
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:21,600
challenging to keep up with everything

436
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:23,759
so abstraction layers what do we learn

437
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,639
from this project abstraction layers

438
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:27,199
make it hard

439
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:28,959
to get scientists involved so using a

440
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:30,880
generic model it's hard for them to

441
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:35,279
accept they they rather have

442
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:35,279
their domain specific entities

443
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,800
and when we want to attract people to

444
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,880
work on it to to to

445
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,719
join the project we see that the

446
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:44,959
attractiveness of a project depends

447
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:49,279
strongly on the 2 chain that we use

448
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:52,399
so python is more attractive than c plus

449
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:53,600
further when we try to find people for

450
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:55,920
different projects

451
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,959
then we figure out that that ui

452
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,959
development

453
00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:01,439
is much more attractive for them than

454
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:05,280
working behind the scenes

455
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:06,959
um and right scientific communities are

456
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:08,480
diverse and supporting

457
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:10,079
large varieties of platforms and

458
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,959
languages is really challenging

459
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:15,119
especially for us as a small team and

460
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:17,679
all of these things wouldn't have been

461
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:18,479
or wouldn't be in the shape they are now

462
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:21,360
this is

463
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,799
true for nixon for odml if we hadn't had

464
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:26,079
lots of support

465
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:29,280
by the g node and also for centromere

466
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:31,918
and the g note actually pays developers

467
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:32,960
to to professional developers full-time

468
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:36,080
developers to

469
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:39,280
to go on with this

470
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:43,439
i think for the sake of time i will

471
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:45,440
skip over these um

472
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:47,679
so as i said we are using different open

473
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:51,200
source tools for for data management

474
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:52,080
or code management um what can we learn

475
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:55,120
from these so

476
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:58,159
i think there are projects that turn

477
00:17:55,120 --> 00:18:01,280
from a hobby to something like a like a

478
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:02,480
a service or yeah people make a living

479
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:06,320
out of it so

480
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:09,440
open source does not need to be a hobby

481
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:11,120
and uh i think there is a

482
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:13,440
kind of a misunderstanding that open

483
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:14,159
source is something that is for free i

484
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,640
think

485
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:18,400
there's open source does not imply that

486
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:20,240
that one may not try to make a living

487
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:22,960
out of it

488
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,679
um using open source tools for data

489
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,320
analysis

490
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:27,679
allows us for tool sharing just imagine

491
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:29,760
that you create

492
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:31,120
or large parts of our institute work

493
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:34,080
with matlab

494
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:36,080
and they happily use all the functions

495
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:38,320
that are hidden somewhere in toolboxes

496
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:40,240
but if you share this with someone else

497
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:42,240
and this person does not have the

498
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,640
toolboxes they they are actually doomed

499
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,120
right

500
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:46,720
they can cannot run the code and i think

501
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:49,360
we need it

502
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,960
and access to raw data and the tools for

503
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:53,600
analysis

504
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:54,640
is really helpful when we try to do far

505
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,959
reviewing of

506
00:18:54,640 --> 00:19:00,160
scientific results during the review

507
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:03,280
process of the paper for example

508
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:05,840
right so who does the work and who

509
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:08,160
should do it

510
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,959
should it be phd students i think there

511
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,120
is a pro

512
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,240
to it yes they learn a lot about the

513
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:14,879
setup the protocols

514
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:17,440
and data handling in general and they

515
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:19,520
improve their skills on programming

516
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:21,120
on the other hand they are unlimited

517
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,960
contact contracts and must

518
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,959
become experts in their science and not

519
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:27,039
necessarily in programming or developing

520
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,640
something like open source

521
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:31,360
so should it be the postdocs or the

522
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:33,520
senior scientists

523
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:35,039
again yes they know exactly what they

524
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:36,799
want what is needed

525
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:38,480
and when they have visited different

526
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:39,440
labs they also have some broader

527
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,200
spectrum

528
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:43,120
and and this experience might come in

529
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:45,039
very very handy

530
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:46,719
on the other side the pressure for

531
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:50,000
scientific success

532
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:50,480
is even higher on this stage and most

533
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,320
are

534
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:54,640
again unlimited context senior

535
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:57,840
scientists have little time due to

536
00:19:54,640 --> 00:20:00,880
different other obligations

537
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:01,918
so professional full-time programmers i

538
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:04,400
think yes

539
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:06,159
the probability they probably write code

540
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,840
much better and much faster than i would

541
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:11,280
do it

542
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:13,600
the caveat is time's up yeah

543
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,879
uh funding agencies fund for software

544
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,678
they happy to give you ten thousand

545
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,480
bucks for fi

546
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:20,720
for buying specific software but usually

547
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:23,520
they don't give you money to hire

548
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,520
a programmer

549
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:28,240
we would love to have long-term

550
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,880
maintainers that are involved in open

551
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:31,520
source

552
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,799
and i think this would be really great

553
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:35,360
if there would be kind of software

554
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:38,158
workshops in institutions

555
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:38,959
so my take-home messages open source and

556
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:40,799
my

557
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:42,799
understanding is is the key for

558
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:43,280
independence and innovation in sciences

559
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:45,440
and

560
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:47,520
to eventually overcome the

561
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:50,159
reproducibility crisis

562
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:53,039
and open source is also the key for data

563
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:53,039
and tool sharing

564
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:59,679
one drawback open source development

565
00:20:57,039 --> 00:21:01,520
largely depends on volunteers and they

566
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:04,240
do it in their free time

567
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:05,039
and the way open source development

568
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,120
works

569
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:10,320
does not always work with the scientists

570
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:10,320
who want to just use it

571
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:14,960
right my claim is we would need long

572
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:17,439
term support

573
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:19,039
for open source tools in in the sciences

574
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:21,200
to co-overcomers

575
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:23,760
finally open source is definitely fun

576
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:31,840
and i want to

577
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:31,840
suggest to keep on hiking thank you

578
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:40,400
questions we do have

579
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:41,120
seven more minutes yes i have two

580
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,679
questions

581
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:44,639
the first one is is it able to get also

582
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:46,320
raw data

583
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,679
from the experiments that you conduct so

584
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:49,120
that we can reproduce it and check out

585
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:50,880
the open source keywords

586
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:52,479
so the question was if it if it is

587
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,679
possible to get the raw data from our

588
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:57,200
experiments

589
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:59,760
yes we usually or recently

590
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:01,120
since a few years publish all the raw

591
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:03,600
data together

592
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:04,799
with some descriptions of how to read it

593
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:08,559
and so on

594
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:10,720
actually on the gin platform so that

595
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:12,480
in principle you could really go and dig

596
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:13,919
into the raw data and i think this is

597
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:16,480
really critical

598
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:17,360
we had some experiences with published

599
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:20,000
data

600
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:21,520
where people found that there is a

601
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,960
linear relation between two

602
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:27,120
two features and they only showed the

603
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:30,320
average of this

604
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:31,199
this thing and when we go and eventually

605
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:33,918
we could dig

606
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:35,600
out the data well it was not the raw

607
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:38,480
data but but some abstract

608
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:40,240
but it was an average across trials and

609
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:41,200
each individual trial showed something

610
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:43,280
like this

611
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:45,679
not the straight line but since these

612
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:48,480
individual low pass like thingies were

613
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:49,760
were shifted across trials it showed up

614
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:52,880
as a line

615
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:54,240
so their interpretation oh yeah it's a

616
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,919
linear relationship this is

617
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:57,840
this was actually not not good and i

618
00:22:55,919 --> 00:23:00,400
think this this can only be

619
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:03,280
dug out if if the information is

620
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:03,280
somewhere available

621
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:10,799
is it possible to play back the data

622
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:13,440
is it possible to play back the data you

623
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:13,440
mean during

624
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:17,600
what do you mean with playing back the

625
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:19,919
data i mean we can we can

626
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,879
write a tool that that makes a movie out

627
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:23,039
of it is that

628
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:24,880
what you so what i mean for example

629
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:26,000
you're recording the signals from a

630
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:28,320
neuron right yeah

631
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,840
and i understand you can store it and

632
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:31,760
charge it and all of that

633
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:34,000
but can you take the data it's stored in

634
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:36,158
such a format that you can

635
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,360
read it and then basically play it back

636
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:40,080
and have let's say

637
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:40,799
another program uh read it and i'm

638
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,158
thinking if

639
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:44,320
you can use something some kind of like

640
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:46,640
machine learning to

641
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:48,559
to to train it to understand the

642
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:51,840
playback of the data that you use

643
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:55,120
you certainly i hope so so

644
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:58,639
yes we could play back the data to

645
00:23:55,120 --> 00:24:02,000
so when it depends how you store it

646
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:05,200
you can decide that you only store

647
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,760
the events for example yeah like the

648
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,520
action

649
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:09,200
times of the action potentials that were

650
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:11,679
generated by that neuron

651
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,880
but since we always record the raw data

652
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:15,520
in completeness that

653
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:17,440
it blows up the the file size but i

654
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:19,840
don't know what we might use it for

655
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:22,400
um we could in principle playback this

656
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:22,399
stuff yes

657
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:28,080
it depends so what do you mean the

658
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,360
activity of the neurons is a millisecond

659
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:31,120
range

660
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:32,559
so the relevant time scales are

661
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:35,520
milliseconds or sometimes

662
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:36,559
ten tens of milliseconds how does it

663
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:38,158
compare to like

664
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:40,480
for example like the large hydrogen

665
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:43,200
collider type of data is

666
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,919
smaller it's yeah definitely much

667
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,960
smaller

668
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:49,360
i had a look at the gravity wave data

669
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:51,279
that was published and it is very very

670
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:54,479
similar to such data actually

671
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:55,600
it's just maybe a larger data set but

672
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:59,120
it's no problem for

673
00:24:55,600 --> 00:25:01,840
for the storage or for the the

674
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,840
recording start

675
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:10,000
what software lies

676
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:10,000
really does it matter

677
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:17,200
so i think we we published some software

678
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:19,279
using the lesser sorry the question was

679
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,559
what software licenses we use and if it

680
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:24,080
matters for us

681
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:26,158
so we use mit-like licenses or or

682
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:29,840
or sometimes we publish something under

683
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:29,840
the lesser-known

684
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:34,960
[Music]

685
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:36,400
i see that at least in this example the

686
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:38,000
use case on the problems that you're

687
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:40,080
facing are very similar to the ones that

688
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,919
we face in the radio community

689
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:43,678
so how do you consider having an

690
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:45,919
interdisciplinary

691
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:46,799
cooperation between for example with the

692
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:49,760
radio community

693
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:50,639
so that you can have easier training

694
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:53,360
work

695
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:54,000
on top of that so the question is if we

696
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:56,959
considered

697
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:59,440
having a joint endeavor with other

698
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:02,640
communities basically

699
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:05,600
well yeah considered yes time-wise

700
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:06,400
not really active so we are part of the

701
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:09,039
um

702
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:10,880
there is for the neuroscience side there

703
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:15,200
is the incf

704
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:18,320
international nurse neuroinformatics

705
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:20,640
coordinating facility thank you

706
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:22,320
and they try to bring people from

707
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:24,080
different aspects of neuroscience

708
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:25,840
together to come up with something

709
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:28,000
that is helpful for standardization and

710
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:30,480
for common tool development

711
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,720
it would be awesome actually the next

712
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:35,039
project is not at all depending on

713
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:36,400
neuroscience right it's not limited to

714
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:39,440
neuroscience data it could

715
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:42,240
store anything but

716
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,640
yeah so far we were weren't really

717
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:53,840
active

718
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:53,840
outside neuroscience

719
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:10,399
is so there were two questions one was

720
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:13,200
please correct me if i'm wrong if we use

721
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:15,919
in vitro or in vivo measurements

722
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,559
and the response is we take in vivo

723
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:19,120
measurements

724
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:20,639
that is the the whole system is alive

725
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:22,719
and at work with all the connections

726
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:25,840
between the different aerials

727
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:28,080
the second thing was

728
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:30,639
open hardware if we consider using open

729
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:34,080
hardware for recording

730
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:37,440
yes and so we we are kind of trying

731
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:41,360
to use the teensys uh

732
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:45,520
controller boards which do offer us some

733
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:47,039
uh enough sampling stuff basically but

734
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:48,799
they are kind of tricky

735
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:51,039
in our circumstances because of other

736
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:51,760
problems but yes generally yes we would

737
00:27:51,039 --> 00:28:03,840
like

738
00:27:51,760 --> 00:28:05,919
thank you very good well thank you

739
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,918
you
