1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,599
okay

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,040
okay guys so we're getting ready for our

3
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:14,400
next speaker

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:16,560
who is mark mattingly scott

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,359
he holds a phd information theory and

6
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,880
has worked at ibm for more than 30 years

7
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:22,800
understanding and transporting new

8
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,519
technology to customers

9
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,080
he's currently the ibm queue ambassador

10
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:28,000
leader

11
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,400
which kind of means that part of his job

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,480
is this awesome task of spreading

13
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,800
excitement about quantum computing

14
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:36,239
around and some might remember from

15
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,959
somebody remember him from the previous

16
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:41,519
talk he gave last year

17
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,000
about quantum computing in the real

18
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,480
world

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,360
so let's uh let's have a look sorry

20
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,000
that's the

21
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,600
title this year yeah i messed up anyway

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,160
let's head it off to mark he's a better

23
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:57,980
speaker than i am

24
00:00:52,160 --> 00:01:00,640
i don't know about that

25
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:02,078
[Applause]

26
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,520
thank you that you applauded at the

27
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:05,119
start of my talk it'll be interesting to

28
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,320
see if you applaud at the end of it as

29
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:08,000
well

30
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,000
um something you should never ever do

31
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,640
when you talk is apologize

32
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,520
but i'm going to apologize because you

33
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,280
should never do it uh

34
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,720
if i if i fall asleep in the middle of

35
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,240
my talk it's because i'm incredibly

36
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:20,880
jet-lagged

37
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,399
uh i was falling asleep earlier but i'm

38
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,199
pretty awake now the adrenaline is doing

39
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:27,360
all the rest

40
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:28,720
so um let's see not quite as many people

41
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:32,079
as last year

42
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:35,600
i have to say but probably more focused

43
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:38,839
that's good so indeed my name is mark

44
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:40,640
mattingly scott i'm british i live in

45
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:42,720
germany

46
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,479
uh i would like to take this opportunity

47
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,960
to observe one minute's

48
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:49,280
silence for the death of the united

49
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,279
kingdom

50
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:52,960
are there any other brits here

51
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:59,119
okay are there any other are there any

52
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:02,250
this is very political are there any

53
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:04,640
pro-exit brexit brits here

54
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:08,800
[Music]

55
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:10,080
are there any pro-brexit brits full stop

56
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,720
sorry i have to get that out of my

57
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:16,640
system i'm so

58
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:18,480
i'm so unhappy about it okay now

59
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,319
let's get back to the uh the topic at

60
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,280
hand which is not political

61
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:24,399
self-destruction

62
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:26,480
but quantum computing and

63
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:29,680
yep so that's a picture of ibm one of

64
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,679
ibm's quantum computers

65
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:38,400
we currently have i think it's 11 or 12

66
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:41,680
of other things online available for

67
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:46,160
you and our customers to use

68
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:48,000
uh you in the sense of uh everybody

69
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:50,160
if you're not in the ibmq network and

70
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,120
you just want to play with it there's

71
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:55,120
i think six five or six which you can

72
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:58,319
use

73
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:01,120
um if you whenever you go to talks about

74
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:01,119
quantum computing

75
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:05,280
you will depending on who's doing the

76
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,560
talking

77
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,360
you will hear claims about exponential

78
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:14,560
speed up

79
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:14,560
and quantum supremacy

80
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:19,840
but if you look closely at the

81
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,519
technology

82
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,840
uh you'll realize that there's actually

83
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:27,280
quite a lot quite a lot of hard work

84
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,400
uh necessary to leverage that to achieve

85
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,360
that

86
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,640
um we know for example we know that

87
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,239
there are certain algorithms which

88
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:37,518
really do

89
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:39,280
or really would provide

90
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:40,560
significant speed up shaw's algorithm

91
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:44,000
for example

92
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:46,239
um but if you look at the technology the

93
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,840
technology is not there yet so the

94
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:49,680
question then becomes

95
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:53,519
what's doable today what what can we

96
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:57,120
actually usefully do today

97
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:59,680
and the question there becomes

98
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,599
when might we be able to do something

99
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,519
commercially meaningful

100
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:04,798
i mean that's the question that

101
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:08,080
everybody is

102
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:09,599
thinking about so i'm not going to give

103
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,959
an answer to that

104
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:12,879
so no i'm not going to stand here and

105
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:16,959
say quantum advantages in

106
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:19,120
3 years or five years or next month

107
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:21,040
but i hope to throw a little bit of

108
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,120
light on

109
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:26,840
how and a more differentiate

110
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:29,280
differentiated way to think about that

111
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:32,719
so

112
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:34,400
uh where have we where have we

113
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:40,080
identified that quantum computing

114
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:43,039
is likely to provide some kind of

115
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:44,560
some kind of advantage in the sense of

116
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:48,479
speed up

117
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:50,960
we we know that

118
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:53,680
a quantum computer or qubits as a kind

119
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:56,880
of hamiltonian solver

120
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,840
is very very careful choice of words

121
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:02,320
here

122
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:06,320
is amenable to solving problems

123
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:10,080
of physics from chemistry

124
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:11,599
where it's about hamiltonians anyway um

125
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,280
and there's a lot of research a lot of

126
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,360
papers being published a lot of

127
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:18,719
experiments being completed

128
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:20,479
uh among others ibm with our with our

129
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:24,160
ibmq network members

130
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:26,639
on exactly that kind of problem

131
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,680
it's fairly clear that quantum computers

132
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,800
are

133
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:32,000
almost certainly going to make a

134
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:35,680
difference in chemistry material science

135
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,680
that kind of thing protein folding

136
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:41,679
exploration uh color chemistry

137
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,520
we've already joined the dots there

138
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,680
we're fairly good idea that's that's

139
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:48,400
going to work

140
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,160
um one the next area where we all think

141
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:52,799
about using quantum computers in is in

142
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,000
the area of optimization

143
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,880
and that's where it gets a little bit

144
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:00,479
more difficult it's not like you can say

145
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:03,280
okay i have i have my ksat

146
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:04,240
uh general personal general purpose

147
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,479
problem

148
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:08,560
and here's an algorithm for solving k

149
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:11,120
sat on a quantum computer

150
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,840
we're not that far yet we do have a

151
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,440
number of

152
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:16,560
uh promising approaches to break that

153
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:19,680
problem down

154
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:22,080
and a number of uh challenges still

155
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,360
but we expect in the area of

156
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,039
optimization

157
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:28,639
also that quantum computers will make a

158
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:30,159
difference third area is optum is um

159
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:31,840
third area is in machine learning

160
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,960
actually the fourth area here for some

161
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,280
reason i've got them

162
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:38,479
labeled two and three and the machine

163
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,479
learning it's a lot more

164
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:42,720
i would say today it's a lot more

165
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,919
speculative

166
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,639
there are algorithms such as the hhl

167
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:50,000
algorithm

168
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:52,639
does anybody has anybody not heard of

169
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,639
hhl

170
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:04,000
this is a lecture theater we're at a

171
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,680
university i expect you to be prepared

172
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:10,319
when you come here

173
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:12,240
okay the hh sorry my sarcastic

174
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:14,560
formerly part of the european union

175
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,720
british humor

176
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:19,039
and combined with jetlag excuse me if

177
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:23,199
i've offended anybody wasn't intentional

178
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:25,840
um so hhl is basically a

179
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:28,319
um very interesting algorithm because it

180
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:30,960
provides

181
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:32,240
in theory at least exponential speed up

182
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:35,840
to invert

183
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:37,360
a matrix in practice

184
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:40,000
it doesn't provide you any speed up

185
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:42,720
because it assumes that

186
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,479
you've initialized your quantum state

187
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:47,520
with your data and that

188
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:49,440
process currently takes away all the

189
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,840
advantage you might get

190
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:53,520
but it's a building block and we expect

191
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,840
that that kind of building block will be

192
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,799
integrated in other building blocks to

193
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:00,318
build

194
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:02,879
larger quantum systems if we look at the

195
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:04,170
application areas

196
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:07,199
in other words where

197
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:10,840
[Music]

198
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:14,319
when we talk to customers or

199
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:16,239
universities where are people looking at

200
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:18,800
using quantum computing this is kind of

201
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:23,120
a non-complete

202
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:23,120
but a non-exhaustive but nevertheless

203
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:32,000
extensive list of application areas

204
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:35,120
and no prizes

205
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,599
for noticing that healthcare life

206
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:40,719
sciences

207
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:43,919
chemicals and financial services

208
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:45,519
is where most of the action is happening

209
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:47,680
these tend to be commercial

210
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:50,399
organizations with

211
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:52,000
a significant significant interest in

212
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:54,000
improving those things

213
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,320
and let's be clear for a bank who are

214
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,360
doing risk analysis

215
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:02,640
a performance improvement of one percent

216
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:03,920
in the accuracy or time that they need

217
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,360
to do

218
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:07,519
particular risk analysis is the

219
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,800
difference between

220
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:10,640
being a business and being out of

221
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:14,160
business so

222
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:16,399
it's a big motivation

223
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,920
so let's have a look at that's the

224
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:21,600
background let's have a look at what a

225
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:26,240
quantum computer actually is and

226
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:29,360
to be clear uh without

227
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:30,240
without losing any generality um and

228
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,440
because we've

229
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,760
got some of these things i'm going to

230
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,279
talk about the ibm quantum computer

231
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,959
we heard there are other ways of

232
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:39,839
implementing qubits with

233
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:40,160
some advantages some disadvantages i'm

234
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:42,399
sure

235
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,279
in the next four or five years that's

236
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,800
going to

237
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:47,200
really accelerate we're going to see

238
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,240
massive leaps in the capabilities of

239
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,839
technologies

240
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,920
we're all going to see we're also going

241
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:54,880
to see one or two technologies basically

242
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:56,399
fall by the wayside but let's take this

243
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:59,519
as an example

244
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:01,920
so what do we have here we have a bunch

245
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:04,320
of

246
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:06,800
uh basically here a bunch of signal

247
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,800
generators

248
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,680
everybody know what a signal does

249
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,760
anybody not know what a signal generator

250
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,760
is

251
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,160
you got it yeah last time i asked a

252
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,440
question hands went up

253
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,040
so you all know the single signal

254
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,880
generator is so the signal generators

255
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:23,839
basically they generate

256
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:26,000
microwave signals um we have things

257
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:27,120
called arbitrary waveform generators

258
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,839
which

259
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:33,600
with those microwaves they make pulses

260
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:36,560
those pulses are fed down

261
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,120
the plumbing in the chandelier at the

262
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,959
top it's

263
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:41,440
room temperature more or less and at the

264
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:45,199
bottom it's

265
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:46,000
15 millikelvin that's an amazing

266
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:49,200
challenge by the way

267
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:52,000
to make that all work um so microwave

268
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,560
pulses are sent down to the chip stuff

269
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,320
happens

270
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:56,239
and then we send other microwave pulses

271
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,959
down to the chip to read stuff out

272
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:01,040
that's how we implement qubits like i

273
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:03,599
said there are other ways to do it but

274
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:05,120
actually you're always talking about

275
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:09,519
some kind of

276
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:12,160
control signal and manipulation signal

277
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:13,440
and readout signal we're using

278
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:15,120
microwaves

279
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,519
if you're using embedded irons that

280
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:21,200
might be lasers

281
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:24,399
whatever so this is the next foil is an

282
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,399
attempt at an animation

283
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:29,839
is it working

284
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:37,760
cheese grommet yeah so

285
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:40,160
here we go microwave pulses go down the

286
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,160
wires

287
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,839
okay you get it

288
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,240
now we need to talk about something we

289
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:55,360
call quantum volume

290
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:58,160
but those microwave pulses and the

291
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:59,120
15 millikelvin device at the end of the

292
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:02,000
wire

293
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:03,920
it's all these are all real things they

294
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:08,480
have real constraints

295
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:08,479
no signal is perfect no pulse is perfect

296
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:13,279
uh

297
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:15,120
there's lots of anecdotes about how you

298
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:18,079
build a refrigeration unit

299
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,639
and how precise and sensitive those

300
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:22,239
copper

301
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:23,839
wave guides are to the extent that you

302
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:26,639
even the torque you use to tighten the

303
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:29,760
bolt is extremely critical

304
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:31,760
so lots of things that can go wrong

305
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:33,200
lots of things that can influence

306
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:36,240
performance

307
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:38,000
um so we have a real world device with

308
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:41,200
real errors

309
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:44,720
and it turns out that

310
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:46,240
more or less yeah i'm

311
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:49,120
simplifying a little bit but more or

312
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:51,120
less the most critical thing

313
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:53,839
to getting a performant quantum computer

314
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:57,920
in other words having lots of qubits

315
00:12:53,839 --> 00:13:02,000
having a insanely long coherence time

316
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:04,319
of probably 150 microseconds

317
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,959
the most important thing is the error

318
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:09,279
rate of the individual qubits

319
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:10,079
if you reduce that means you can do you

320
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:13,760
can play with

321
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:15,599
the other factors not strictly speaking

322
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:18,399
100 percent true but it's it's more or

323
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:20,320
less how it works

324
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:22,959
so we measure quantum volume basically

325
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:26,079
by uh

326
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:29,279
creating a um

327
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:29,760
a set of random qubit uh qubit two gate

328
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:32,959
qubit

329
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:36,319
um two gate operations

330
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:39,760
and measuring the cumulative error rate

331
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,760
and that gives us

332
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:45,120
this graph now

333
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:48,160
this no this isn't graph this is this is

334
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:52,320
moore's law sorry my apologies

335
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:54,639
so this is moore's law and the idea of

336
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:56,480
measuring quantum volume is to find

337
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:58,480
something

338
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:00,240
comparable to moore's law so moore's law

339
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,480
was

340
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:05,680
published by gordon moore i think in

341
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,680
popular electronics

342
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:12,399
1963

343
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:14,959
yeah he observed the development of

344
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:15,839
silicon chips he saw that the die size

345
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:17,359
was

346
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:19,040
increasing every year and that the

347
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,880
feature size of the transistors was

348
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,079
decreasing and put the two factors

349
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,600
together and said

350
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:26,959
number of transistors is going to double

351
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:29,440
every 18 months you all know this

352
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:31,119
so we're always searching for some kind

353
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,720
of

354
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,959
some kind of analogy in quantum

355
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:37,600
computing and the reason we're searching

356
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:42,160
for an analogy in quantum computing is

357
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:45,440
that if you've got a comparable

358
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:47,360
and comparable growth rate in some

359
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:50,000
meaningful measure of the power of your

360
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:53,680
quantum computer

361
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:56,480
with the things that are influencing

362
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:58,959
that y-axis

363
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:00,800
where you know what's what's influenced

364
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:02,160
them influencing them you know what the

365
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,880
challenges are

366
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:06,560
you know what the engineering and

367
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:10,720
physical challenges are you know what

368
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:10,719
the phys the physics limitations are

369
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:15,360
so you've got the graph you can then

370
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:18,480
start to think about

371
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:21,680
oh well you know if i get up to

372
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,720
so many qubits or particular quantum

373
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:25,599
volume

374
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,800
then i can solve a particular real world

375
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:29,440
problem so it gives you

376
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:31,040
more of a handle on how long it's going

377
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:33,440
to take to be able to solve a class of

378
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,439
problems

379
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:38,320
if you look at the idea of quantum

380
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:39,920
volume

381
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,680
then there is a whole bunch of other

382
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:44,240
things which flow into

383
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:47,040
how well you can use quantum computer

384
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:50,079
one of which is of course the algorithms

385
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:54,560
um so we're all who who's actually

386
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:56,800
working on algorithm development here

387
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:58,160
can we have more hands clearly shown

388
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:01,439
please

389
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:04,319
sir can you hold your hand up be brave

390
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,320
don't be ashamed

391
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:10,160
anybody else he's developing the biggest

392
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:13,360
algorithms

393
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:13,360
humongous algorithms

394
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,199
so what are you what are you working on

395
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:20,880
few

396
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:23,680
okay yeah so a lot of work going on

397
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:25,040
developing algorithms but if we look at

398
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:28,239
the

399
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:29,839
the ibm q's systems then

400
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:32,720
there's a whole bunch of other stuff in

401
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:37,839
there which also plays a major role

402
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:37,839
one that always surprises me is

403
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:45,040
calibration errors

404
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:51,920
measurement fidelity gate parallelism

405
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:54,560
but also things like how good is your

406
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,560
compiler

407
00:16:54,880 --> 00:17:02,240
so we the quiz kit aqua

408
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,240
transpiler is open sourced

409
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:09,360
it is a a

410
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:11,120
an actor active area of both within ibm

411
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:13,119
and in the community of

412
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:15,359
development to improve that transpiler

413
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:16,000
because just by being clever about how

414
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:18,399
you do

415
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,439
gate elimination how you optimize can

416
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,439
make a huge difference

417
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:28,640
and so if we look at the

418
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:33,360
the latest machine that we have which is

419
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:36,720
a 53 cubic machine it's a topology

420
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:37,520
then one of the things we discovered was

421
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:41,520
that

422
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:43,600
if you try and entangle

423
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:45,440
too many qubits using joseph's

424
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:48,240
injunctions

425
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:49,840
basically the error rates uh increase so

426
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:52,480
much

427
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:54,879
that it it's counterproductive so you

428
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,880
need to

429
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:01,840
you do that software optimization

430
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:08,400
and if we look at where ibm is right now

431
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:10,080
on our quantum volume if you want a

432
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,760
definition of what quantum volume is

433
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:14,159
then there is

434
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:17,200
somewhere there's a link to a paper

435
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,200
explaining how it works

436
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:23,039
we now have four data points uh about

437
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:26,719
three months ago we only had three

438
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:28,480
now we have four and we've committed to

439
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,440
doubling that so it's a logarithmic

440
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,960
scale up here

441
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:33,200
we've committed to doubling that every

442
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,200
year

443
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,000
without saying how long we're going to

444
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:39,520
double it i'll leave that to the senior

445
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,200
executives

446
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:43,360
but it's feasible it's feasible to

447
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:45,840
divert to double this quantum volume

448
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:49,199
and then it becomes a do we have a

449
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:49,199
pointer here is this a pointer

450
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:55,280
it's either a pointer or some medical

451
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:59,200
device we're doing

452
00:18:55,280 --> 00:19:00,000
unspeakable things just small animals

453
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,960
probably

454
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,960
yeah i'm going to leave it

455
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:06,880
do you think i should like

456
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:11,840
it's a microphone

457
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,480
i've got all this stuff

458
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:23,600
buried in here somewhere good thinking

459
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:26,720
mark

460
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:29,360
so i guess this yeah

461
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:31,600
okay so one of the things you can do is

462
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:33,840
you can say

463
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:36,159
well right now with this quantum volume

464
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,159
here

465
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:41,520
here we can

466
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:44,799
[Music]

467
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:49,520
we can calculate

468
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:49,520
energy behavior of uh

469
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:54,480
of battery catalyst of battery

470
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:57,520
electrodes or battery electrolytes

471
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:58,240
and that's a real use case and there was

472
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,960
a paper

473
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:02,400
paper published a few weeks ago by

474
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:05,440
daimler

475
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:07,360
and ourselves doing exactly that but

476
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:10,960
then the question becomes okay what can

477
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:15,840
i do if my quantum volume is here

478
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:15,840
well 2024

479
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:21,520
is a quantum volume of a thousand

480
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:24,719
realistic in 2024

481
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:25,039
i don't know it's i won't guarantee it

482
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,200
but

483
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:29,120
it's not infeasible with a quantum

484
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:31,200
volume with 1 000

485
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:32,399
or you can do all sorts of you might be

486
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,600
able to all sorts of

487
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:37,840
interesting things so what i'm saying is

488
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:39,280
think about it this way how long is it

489
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:41,439
going to take to get to where i need to

490
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,440
be

491
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:46,559
if you look at the devices we currently

492
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,720
have online some of these are

493
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:50,080
publicly available some of them you can

494
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,919
use

495
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:53,520
some of you can't in particular the

496
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:56,159
rochester devices only for

497
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:57,840
for organizations in the ibmq network we

498
00:20:56,159 --> 00:21:00,960
have different topologies

499
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:03,840
so you can use that to play with

500
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,840
different topologies

501
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:08,080
what you can also do and i thoroughly

502
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:12,879
recommend people

503
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:12,879
uh take a look at this

504
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:19,760
there is a textbook

505
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:23,760
on our api quiz kit api

506
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:24,320
textbook where it uses the api but it's

507
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:27,679
a

508
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:30,799
textbook on quantum computing

509
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:31,760
it's on github it's open sourced and if

510
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:35,840
you want to use it

511
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:35,840
i think it's uh

512
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,879
i forget the i forget the type of

513
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:44,399

00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:47,600
what's the word creative commons

515
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:50,080
so have fun

516
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:51,280
um but we do see we also see a lot of

517
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:54,399
external

518
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:56,840
um committers

519
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:59,120
or we've enabled a lot of external

520
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:02,158
committers

521
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:03,120
looking at the api and the reason i want

522
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:04,480
to do this is because i

523
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:06,399
just want to spend a couple of minutes

524
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:09,760
delving into one part of it

525
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:13,200
so we our api we have

526
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:17,120
these four areas aqua which is very much

527
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:17,760
applications uh air which is a special

528
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,600
purpose

529
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,799
simulator which simulates the real

530
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:23,840
hardware it's not an

531
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:25,918
ideal quantum computer

532
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:27,439
ignis which i'm going to take a look at

533
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:29,919
in a second for doing

534
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,960
error mitigation and terror which is

535
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:33,120
basically

536
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:35,440
the gate the gates gate and circuit

537
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:38,639
level

538
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:40,880
models so

539
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:43,120
try the ibm quantum experience it's

540
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:47,520
everywhere you'd expect it to be

541
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:49,600
so crispy ignis and this

542
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:51,280
is probably what's going to be of

543
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:54,480
interest to some of you

544
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:57,840
so ignis is basically we expose

545
00:22:54,480 --> 00:23:01,600
through the ignis api the

546
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:04,480
open pulse standard

547
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:06,959
so at this level you are not interacting

548
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:10,480
with the quantum computer anymore with

549
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:13,039
gates or with api calls you're actually

550
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:14,880
defining and sending microwave pulses to

551
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:18,799
the device

552
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:22,480
and the publicly available

553
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:24,720
machines one of those exposes this api

554
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:26,159
was the publicly available one this is

555
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:30,880
the only one

556
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:33,440
and it's a single qubit don't laugh

557
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:35,120
it's actually very still very useful

558
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:37,840
because it allows you to really look at

559
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,840
error mitigation

560
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,640
be my guest

561
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:49,600
so let's have a quick look at ignis

562
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,559
yeah so ignis allows you to do things

563
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:55,600
like the

564
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:58,158
uh error mitigation error calibration

565
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,799
and i've just temporarily forgotten the

566
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:03,760
name of the

567
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:06,879
it's begins with r the error

568
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:10,080
calibration algorithm

569
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:13,120
will come to me in a second so you can

570
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:16,799
play with the uh

571
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:20,239
one qubit quantum computer which exposes

572
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:22,480
the open pulse api and

573
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:25,279
what we often not always but what we

574
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:29,679
often see is that

575
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:31,600
developing what i would say is not ideal

576
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:33,279
algorithms but things where you think

577
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,639
okay this this

578
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:35,230
this is getting towards something that

579
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,559
will work in

580
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:39,679
[Music]

581
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:41,678
perhaps in the real world is

582
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:42,880
yes it's important to know about things

583
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:44,960
like h

584
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:46,320
the hhl algorithm or the quantum fourier

585
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:48,320
transform or

586
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:51,120
phase estimation these things are

587
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:53,200
important you have to understand that

588
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:55,279
but then you have to really understand

589
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:58,240
the circuit level you have to understand

590
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:59,679
the details of what's going on and then

591
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:01,200
if you want to take it further and get

592
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:02,240
even more performance you have to look

593
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:05,200
at this level as well

594
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:06,159
so all those levels are important for

595
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:09,279
those of you who

596
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:11,440
are uh electronics engineers or

597
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:12,320
have some familiarity with electronics

598
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:15,120
it's a bit like

599
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:18,399
the very early days of of

600
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:18,399
transistor-based computers

601
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:22,879
going from architecture literally down

602
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:25,760
to

603
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:28,159
what kind of what kind of basis

604
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:30,799
semiconductor technology do i use

605
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:32,000
for my chips how do i interconnect how

606
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:35,279
do i manage

607
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:38,000
clocks all that sort of thing so that's

608
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:38,000
all exposed

609
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:44,320
the this is the mobile machine which is

610
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:46,480
the largest

611
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:48,559
publicly available machine it's a

612
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:51,840
16-qubit machine

613
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:55,520
um and this is our monk

614
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:59,439
which is the single qubit which exposes

615
00:25:55,520 --> 00:26:03,360
the uh open pulse api um

616
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:05,760
and uh i don't know has anybody used

617
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,760
armor

618
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:11,360
nobody's used it it's

619
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,120
the most fast for me the most

620
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:14,719
fascinating part of quantum computing is

621
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:17,360
at this level because you literally

622
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:19,520
you're playing with microwave pulses and

623
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:22,320
um

624
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:23,360
question i often get is yeah can can you

625
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:27,279
use this api

626
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:27,279
to break the qubits

627
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:37,200
no we're not that

628
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:40,880
stupid we have we've put you know

629
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:42,080
controls and and uh things in there to

630
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:44,640
prevent that happening

631
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:45,360
uh either inadvertently or intentionally

632
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:49,520
um

633
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:53,199
so it's safe to use so

634
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:54,639
we are if we look at what what's

635
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:56,240
where's the road to getting to quantum

636
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:57,679
advantage in other words the point where

637
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:01,520
these things actually become

638
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:03,520
commercially useful um and

639
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:04,960
for those of you sitting here

640
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:08,080
commercially useful i guess

641
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:09,840
is one aspect

642
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:12,480
the fun aspect the intellectual

643
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:14,480
challenge aspect and of course

644
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:16,159
is this going to help me some point down

645
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:17,440
the road is it

646
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:21,120
somebody going to be sufficiently

647
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:23,279
interested in this um

648
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:24,639
we're at the stage of quantum readiness

649
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:25,039
or we consider ourselves to be a state

650
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:28,559
of

651
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:32,000
quantum readiness right now um and we

652
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:35,678
anticipate that in the near future

653
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:39,120
in the near future

654
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:42,559
so i was born in 1961 which makes me 58

655
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:45,918
years old i'm turning 59 in november

656
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:50,399
uh ibm will compose compulsorily

657
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:50,399
retire me in about six years

658
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:56,320
so the foreseeable future means i expect

659
00:27:53,520 --> 00:28:03,200
to see quantum advantage in

660
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:07,439
some applications areas before i retire

661
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:11,440
if you belong to or are associated with

662
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:14,880
or in charge of or studying at

663
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:19,039
any of these organizations good luck

664
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:21,440
congratulations uh

665
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:22,158
well not all of them this is where

666
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:26,480
thomas

667
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:29,200
look at his face look at his face this

668
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:29,200
isn't it sad

669
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:36,639
so not everybody gets full access

670
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:36,640
for thomas we had to restrict it

671
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:41,200
but basically if you're one of these

672
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:44,480
organizations here

673
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:46,559
so obviously commercial companies but

674
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:49,200
here this this might be very interesting

675
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:53,360
or these here a lot of universities

676
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:58,080
or these here so there's currently 102

677
00:28:53,360 --> 00:29:00,879
we broke the 100 the end of last year

678
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:02,879
and we've set our aggressive goals to

679
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:05,360
expand that this year

680
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:06,640
so these are all members of the ibm q

681
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:09,678
network and they have

682
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:10,480
more or less access to all the other

683
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:13,520
qubit

684
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:14,880
quantum computers and if you don't

685
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:16,720
you aren't a member of one of these or

686
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:19,200
associated with one

687
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:21,600
and you don't have access to the ibmq

688
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:25,440
network you still have access to all the

689
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:30,240
free machines and play on those

690
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:33,360
you may have heard we announced uh

691
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:36,399
last october uh

692
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:37,918
the club collaboration with fraunhofer

693
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:41,840
in germany

694
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:44,320
to uh put together a

695
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:45,199
joint program there was also an

696
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:47,200
announcement

697
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:49,279
in december that we're doing something

698
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:51,679
sim similar but not exactly the same in

699
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:51,679
japan

700
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:55,279
and i think that underlines the fact

701
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:56,640
that this is the whole thing about

702
00:29:55,279 --> 00:30:00,559
quantum computing

703
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:01,679
is very strategic strategic in the sense

704
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:05,120
of

705
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:08,480
um of strategic importance

706
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:09,120
to economies i don't know the exact

707
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:12,399
figure

708
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:13,039
or even a it's it's about 10 10 to 12

709
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:14,320
billion

710
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:16,480
currently being invested in quantum

711
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:17,520
computing but the projections all the

712
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:19,120
projections i see is

713
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:22,799
that's going to increase it massively

714
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:26,969
over the next two to three years

715
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:28,320
something for you guys and girls here

716
00:30:26,970 --> 00:30:32,240
[Music]

717
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:36,240
the quiz kit uh quiz kit camps

718
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:36,240
so there's one due to happen here

719
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:43,679
taking place in new york

720
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:46,720
where i've just flown in from i traverse

721
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:49,520
to vermont so march

722
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:50,720
traverse from new york to vermont i

723
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:52,879
guess that's something like you know

724
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:56,080
those who survive it

725
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:58,080
uh win

726
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:59,760
and those who don't freeze in the snow i

727
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:02,158
don't know

728
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:04,000
we hold these things regularly keep keep

729
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:07,200
an eye out for those

730
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:10,240
anybody's welcome to apply um

731
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:11,120
we you know we do help and support as

732
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:14,320
well

733
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:17,199
and uh that's a

734
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:20,158
a good way and an interesting way to

735
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:23,279
contribute and to meet like-minded souls

736
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:24,960
who are obsessed with and in love with

737
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:27,360
quantum computing

738
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,360
like me

739
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:35,679
and you i hope okay i've

740
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:37,519
in my my jet lag waffling i've said

741
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:41,580
enough now and i think i'm

742
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:45,039
yeah i guess questions

743
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:47,840
[Applause]

744
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:47,840
oh

745
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:51,678
one one point one point okay here's some

746
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:53,440
some advertisement

747
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:55,440
advertising does anybody know what this

748
00:31:53,440 --> 00:32:00,399
is

749
00:31:55,440 --> 00:32:01,440
yes yes okay now if i was if i had the

750
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:05,360
courage to open this

751
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:07,039
this thing up which i packed last night

752
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:09,120
and it's one of the you know this when

753
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:11,600
you open the bag up and it goes

754
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:12,320
that's the state there's a part there's

755
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:15,678
a pie

756
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:18,879
zero in there so if you go

757
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:24,240
if you go on github and search for

758
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:24,240
uh ibmq system one 3d model

759
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:29,840
you'll find it so there is a 3d model

760
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:31,600
if there's anybody with a 3d printer

761
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:34,720
here

762
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:36,240
please go and print the thing there are

763
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:41,039
some design files in there

764
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:41,039
there's also a

765
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:45,039
instruction set on how to compile quiz

766
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:48,320
kit

767
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:52,240
the the quizkitch terra api

768
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:54,799
onto the pi and as of two days ago

769
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:55,519
it now runs on a pi zero so the idea is

770
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:58,320
we put the pi

771
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:59,600
zero in the model it will have leds so

772
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:02,000
it has leds

773
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:03,279
and you can actually interact with it

774
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,159
and um

775
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:08,399
maybe somebody wants to write the code

776
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:10,960
to actually reflect the

777
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:12,799
um so if you're using uh the simulator

778
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:15,200
using the air simulator you can actually

779
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:16,399
see the internal state of the the

780
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:18,159
computer

781
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:19,918
because you're simulating it or actually

782
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:23,519
reflect that on the on the model

783
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:26,320
so an interesting way to interact and uh

784
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:27,360
for sure a conversation starter um okay

785
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,960
now

786
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:30,399
okay we have time for two questions and

787
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:31,840
may i ask to not

788
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:33,279
like everyone to leave the room right

789
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:35,199
now because otherwise it's very hard to

790
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:39,840
understand what people are saying

791
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:39,840
um so are there any questions

792
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,960
one of the key things about quantum

793
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:47,760
computers is the interconnect between

794
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:50,240
the qubits

795
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:51,279
yes is this factored into the quantum

796
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:53,840
volume as well

797
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:55,360
because okay because if there's not

798
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:57,840
enough connectivity you're gonna

799
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:58,559
basically not be able to use the qubits

800
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:07,840
well

801
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:07,840
so the thing is

802
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:14,720
there are qubit technologies where for

803
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:14,719
example you have three dimensions

804
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:21,839
so you have a

805
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:26,879
try drawing that when you're jet lagged

806
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:28,639
um

807
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:30,799
so you have maybe a qubit here and you

808
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:33,520
keep it here and keep it here

809
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:36,000
so you can do you know three-dimensional

810
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:39,359
ideal connectivity

811
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:41,918
um with transmon

812
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:44,399
josephson junctions you have a 2d

813
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:44,399
lattice

814
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:52,399
um theoretically you can do this as well

815
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:59,279
yeah so the edges you have connectivity

816
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,400
three in the middle you have a

817
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:03,599
connectivity of

818
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:06,160
six uh eight in practice the eight

819
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:08,079
connectivity is completely useless

820
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:11,040
because the way you manipulate transmog

821
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:13,839
qubits is with microwave pulses

822
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:15,599
and it's kind of like every time you

823
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:16,078
fire a pulse at something it's a quantum

824
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:19,680
system

825
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:21,280
every time you fire a pulse at something

826
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:22,720
something happens whether you you know

827
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,680
there are always parasitic things

828
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:27,759
happening

829
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:30,960
so that's why in the topologies

830
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:33,440
the scaled topologies you see

831
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:35,920
you know these large rings of cubics

832
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,920
like this

833
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,640
a bunch of qubits

834
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:43,520
[Applause]

835
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:45,839
the key question is what's the penalty

836
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:49,359
when you're

837
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:52,799
when your your mesh connectivity

838
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:54,960
is less than ideal the ideal one would

839
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,960
be

840
00:35:56,160 --> 00:36:02,720
and this is a this is a vague attempt at

841
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,160
physics irony the ideal one would be an

842
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:07,598
dimensional

843
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:07,920
uh n-dimensional space where every qubit

844
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:11,119
was

845
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:13,839
intangible with every other qubit uh

846
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:13,839
here it's not the case

847
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:22,400
how can you get around that well

848
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:23,520
if your gate fidelity if your aerates

849
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:25,040
are sufficient you've got sufficient

850
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:27,359
coherence time

851
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:29,920
you can swap you know you can entangle

852
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:35,040
for example

853
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:38,640
these two but if your circuit wants

854
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:38,640
this one to be entangled with this one

855
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:42,640
you can actually do that if you've got

856
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:43,440
sufficient fidelity and sufficient error

857
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:46,480
rates you can

858
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:49,440
there are ways to there were

859
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:52,079
ways to i wouldn't say fake it but there

860
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:52,079
are ways to

861
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:56,400
not physically physically move the

862
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:58,800
qubits but

863
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:00,880
computationally move them then the

864
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:03,359
question becomes

865
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:04,079
how good does the compiler have to be

866
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:06,839
and

867
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:08,079
what effect does that have on circuit

868
00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:11,680
depth

869
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:15,200
and the heuristics we see are

870
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:17,680
uh the compiler is a compiler is a

871
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:20,799
compiler as a compiler

872
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:22,560
the effect on circuit depth is

873
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:23,839
for most of the algorithms you see out

874
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:28,078
there like vqe and

875
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:28,078
the the stuff people using it's

876
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:33,040
appears to be polynomial

877
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:36,800
so i don't know is that a very

878
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:39,119
long-winded answer to your question

879
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,920
okay so we're out of time so let's thank

880
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:40,940
mark

881
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:44,320
for the talk

882
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:51,839
[Applause]

883
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:51,839
thank you

884
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,319
you
