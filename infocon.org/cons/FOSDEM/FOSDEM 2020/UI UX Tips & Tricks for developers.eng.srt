1
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:08,639
i think we're good

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:09,519
so i'm going to hand over to cathy who's

3
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:12,559
got a great talk

4
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:16,560
about tips and tricks of design

5
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:19,039
for developers

6
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,320
okay so hi my name is zakater namoraru

7
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:22,720
you can find me on

8
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,480
twitter at the valik i don't know if

9
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:26,640
you've been to

10
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,599
amit stock he talked about patterns in

11
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,439
architecture

12
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,720
but similar to architecture we also have

13
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:33,200
patterns for

14
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,160
interface design and i provided a link

15
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,880
there if you

16
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,839
the slides are available on on twitter

17
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,000
so you can go

18
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:42,079
if you're interested in more because

19
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,320
some of you asked about patterns

20
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:45,680
but in this talk we're going to go even

21
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,879
lower so

22
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:51,120
even at the core principle um

23
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:51,919
so there will be like the basics so

24
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,559
patterns are

25
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,520
are more advanced uh maybe we can talk

26
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:58,160
about that in the future

27
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:00,160
but now we'll go even lower so

28
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:03,440
principles are fundamental rules

29
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:05,840
and if you were to uh

30
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:07,280
apply just one principle in your

31
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,960
day-to-day interfaces that would be

32
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,600
consistency

33
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,880
so what consistency means if the user

34
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:15,600
learns your interface

35
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,560
once he will know how to use it in

36
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,839
subsequent

37
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,799
usages and that is very important

38
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:24,640
because

39
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:27,520
it's much faster for him to react

40
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:29,600
but if we're saying that we're designing

41
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,079
a consistent interface this doesn't mean

42
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,798
that

43
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:34,880
all the buttons needs to be the same

44
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:37,759
there are several types of buttons

45
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:39,280
and it's very important to have a

46
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:41,840
primary action

47
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,680
on your screen so the user needs to know

48
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,240
what is the main thing you want him to

49
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,280
do

50
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:49,520
and the primary actions are usually

51
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,960
designed with most more contrasting

52
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:54,079
colors so

53
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:57,360
he gets the points on what you want

54
00:01:54,079 --> 00:02:00,639
him to do and they should be like

55
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,640
only one one per screen

56
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:07,280
and this primary buttons needs to be

57
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,039
very clear so we should avoid things

58
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:12,000
like yes or no

59
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:12,399
or read more or stuff like that users

60
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,400
think

61
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,319
in actions they want to delete something

62
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:19,599
or they want to add or to edit

63
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:20,238
so we should use verbs uh we should not

64
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:24,000
have like

65
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:25,200
a buttons like i mean we could give

66
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,680
context but

67
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,319
verbs are more more efficient in terms

68
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,840
of

69
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:33,760
of directing the the action and also

70
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,879
when we ask the questions we should

71
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:37,440
avoid like

72
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:39,120
double negatives or very abstract things

73
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,359
we should use a common language

74
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,239
and make it very clear what what we want

75
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,560
them to

76
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:44,560
to do

77
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,760
there has been a very big debate on

78
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,239
where the battle should be played should

79
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,160
be

80
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:53,280
placed on the left side or on the right

81
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,799
side and

82
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,879
if we are developing a native

83
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,440
application it's much more easy because

84
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:00,399
the

85
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:01,519
uh operating systems have guidelines and

86
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,680
style guides and

87
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:05,599
they have a preference but if you're

88
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:09,360
designing for the web on the web

89
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:14,079
the rules are not that strict so um

90
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:16,080
i just want to um show you some

91
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,239
some points of why you should pick one

92
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,800
or another so for example on left

93
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,920
align it's very easy for the user to

94
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,080
vertical scan

95
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:26,159
he can read the title or he can read the

96
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,640
labels and if he finds the button at the

97
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:29,040
end

98
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,760
he can just jump from the title to the

99
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,359
action

100
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,679
but if you want the user to actually

101
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,599
read the the description text

102
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,280
he will make like a z shape so he will

103
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:39,679
read the description and then

104
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,680
he will need to press the button so uh

105
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,840
in this case the position matters

106
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,360
because for example if you're using left

107
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,519
align um

108
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,519
he will read the text he will go to the

109
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,799
primary he will see the secondary and he

110
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:54,000
will need to go back so

111
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:56,239
it's a bit uh longer to

112
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,920
to to react like a millisecond or

113
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:00,400
something but can add up or

114
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:02,319
at least compare to to the other right

115
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:06,000
aligned

116
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:06,560
now it also matters if you're designing

117
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,959
for

118
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,959
large interfaces or small interfaces if

119
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:12,879
you are doing a mobile application

120
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,080
uh it doesn't really matter if it's on

121
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:14,798
the left side or on the right side

122
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:18,239
because the

123
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:20,959
the width is very tight

124
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:23,120
there are some interfaces that even put

125
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:24,160
the buttons in the middle or the buttons

126
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:27,280
are full width

127
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,080
but when we are designing for web and

128
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,559
now

129
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:33,359
as developers we like to have like 8k

130
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:35,520
monitors if we can afford them

131
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:38,400
if you don't have columns if you are

132
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:41,120
applying a right align

133
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,320
layout the buttons can get separated

134
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,560
from the context

135
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,919
so the user might feel lost or not see

136
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:49,280
the connection

137
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:49,280
between between the actions

138
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:54,880
so here again he will do like a nail

139
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:54,880
shape

140
00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:00,080
now uh i've talked about primary and

141
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,800
secondary action

142
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:04,320
the thing is that and regarding patterns

143
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,120
there are some patterns like like

144
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,639
wizards

145
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,720
where you have multiple steps and you

146
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:11,759
need to go like next and

147
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,400
in previous and if you're designing for

148
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:15,280
someone

149
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,840
from western culture um when we read

150
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,000
books

151
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,840
we kind of go from from right to left

152
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,960
and we're switching pages

153
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:26,479
so that's why next button uh

154
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:30,560
feel more natural to be placed

155
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:32,400
on the right side but even

156
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:35,120
when you're placing them just make sure

157
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:37,758
that the primary action is on the edge

158
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,720
edges are much more accessible because

159
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:41,120
they're coming so

160
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:44,080
so don't place the primary action in in

161
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,080
the middle of the screen

162
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,880
so again you need to decide do i have

163
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,440
wizards in the interface do i need to

164
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,719
place them

165
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,320
on the right but if you place them on

166
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,880
the right place them everywhere don't

167
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,599
don't

168
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:59,039
switch the position depending on what

169
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,039
interface pattern you're applying

170
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:06,159
okay buttons uh in colors in general

171
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:08,000
um it's very nice that we can

172
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,360
attribute some color meaning to the

173
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,080
actions and

174
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:14,400
again be very sensitive of your target

175
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:17,280
in western cultures red means danger

176
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:19,039
and errors but in asia red means

177
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:21,359
abundance and luck

178
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:22,080
etc so they have reversed the green and

179
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,440
red

180
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:28,719
um but even if we can

181
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:32,000
give like all the cultures try to limit

182
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,639
the palette in order to be more pleasing

183
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,479
and

184
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:40,000
we can convey um in other ways the

185
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:43,520
things like warnings and and infos

186
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:46,720
and why it's important at least to have

187
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,039
one one color for dangerous action is

188
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,680
that

189
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:51,520
if you assure consistency across the

190
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:54,400
interface and all your buttons are

191
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:56,240
are let's say uh gray and blue when the

192
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,120
user will see a red button he will

193
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,479
understand that

194
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:03,520
that is a very important um or or

195
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:07,120
it's something up with that action

196
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:08,240
and for destructive states

197
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,680
it's really important to ask

198
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,479
confirmation so if you're doing

199
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,479
something

200
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:14,560
that will affect the user ask him to see

201
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:17,599
if he didn't accidentally press

202
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:20,240
that and i know it's harder to implement

203
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:21,840
the undues and measure controls but they

204
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,680
could be very helpful for the user to

205
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,960
feel in control and safe and know that

206
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,759
he can

207
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,758
come back to that

208
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:34,479
okay and uh

209
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,039
um i know we talked about a lot about

210
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:37,280
buttons

211
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:38,719
we still have but there's another

212
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:41,840
principle which is called

213
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,639
uh affordance and affordance um the

214
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:45,119
metaphor is

215
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:46,560
like when you see a door and if the door

216
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,879
has a circular handle

217
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,319
you might know that you might need to to

218
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:53,199
switch the handle

219
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:54,160
again if the door has like a like a pool

220
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:55,759
you know that maybe

221
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,440
you could pull it or you can push it and

222
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:59,280
that's why sometimes when

223
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,639
the door does the reverse thing of what

224
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,359
you're expecting you might be a bit

225
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:04,080
confused

226
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,800
you don't know what the direction uh the

227
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,599
same

228
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,800
for this principle can be applied to

229
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:11,199
links

230
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,720
so for the people that have been for a

231
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,800
long time on the web

232
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,000
when they see something that is blue and

233
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,599
that is underlined

234
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,080
they might think that okay that's a link

235
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:23,919
so or at least i know that's a link

236
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:26,159
um so be very careful when applying um

237
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:28,479
blue to headers or things that are not

238
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,479
linked

239
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:34,320
in the past year the designers wanted to

240
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:36,719
to leave the the old habits and maybe

241
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:40,080
try to express themselves with color so

242
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:43,120
it's okay to have links of other colors

243
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:45,040
according to your your color theme uh

244
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:48,480
but the most affordables based on your

245
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:51,439
prior experience are blue and underlined

246
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,440
same for buttons

247
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:56,080
when you see a button buttons usually

248
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,600
have the click state and you know

249
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,360
that you need to be pressed they have

250
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:02,080
multiple states so

251
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:04,240
uh in order to increase usability they

252
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,920
should be represented at 3d objects that

253
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,440
have some shadows or that have some

254
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:10,479
borders or they have some

255
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:12,800
some gradients uh the flat trend

256
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,680
for the past years have lowered the bid

257
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,439
the usability

258
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,719
of the things because you don't know if

259
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:19,200
that's just a container

260
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:22,080
or it's actually a button so ideally

261
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,600
they should have these affordances that

262
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:28,320
can help the user know

263
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:28,320
what type of of entity is in the page

264
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:35,279
one of the question is okay when we have

265
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,240
an action what do you we use do with

266
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:40,000
buttons or do

267
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:42,480
we use links and if maybe

268
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,720
it's more clear that you should not have

269
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:47,040
buttons inside the text because maybe

270
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,080
you'll have some alignment things that

271
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,680
the line height

272
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,200
will get increased because the button

273
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:54,959
that don't have the same

274
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:56,959
12 pixels or 16 pixel this is not

275
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:58,319
actually the way we should rational

276
00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:00,160
about them uh

277
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,680
buttons the links have been created for

278
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:04,160
very specific purposes

279
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,199
so uh you should use buttons when you

280
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,640
you

281
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,320
would like to have an action so

282
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,319
something that changes inside the

283
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:12,000
interface you're adding an element or

284
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,600
or or you're producing changes on the

285
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,240
database or something like that so

286
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,560
actions

287
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,480
while if you're just navigating to other

288
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:23,599
places you should use

289
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:23,600
links okay

290
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:28,880
another principle is the proximity

291
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,439
principle

292
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,720
so objects that are closer together are

293
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,800
perceived to be related

294
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,240
and this is a very strong visual

295
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:39,359
principle that you we could use

296
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:42,880
inside the interfaces so for example

297
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:46,240
if you would have a menu if you just

298
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:48,480
put some entries more closely

299
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,760
together people will um will perceive

300
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,920
them as related

301
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:54,079
but it's very important to actually be

302
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:56,160
related not just place them because they

303
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:57,760
visually look nicer and this is an

304
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:00,800
example of

305
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:04,319
how it was used to be done in

306
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:08,399
in gmail for for an older version

307
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:10,640
okay another related principle is the

308
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:15,839
similarity

309
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:15,839
so similarity states that

310
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:22,160
that object sharing attribute are

311
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:24,640
perceived to be related and we can

312
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:26,399
force that using colors or shape or

313
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:29,439
orientation so

314
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:32,240
if you would want to try to read this

315
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,640
let's say uh paralyzed your brains will

316
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,800
will

317
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:36,319
will be harder for your brain because uh

318
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:39,040
he will naturally the brain

319
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,959
will naturally try to put them in in

320
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:43,760
groups

321
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:45,518
uh and having this um similarity and

322
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:47,760
proximity principle in mind

323
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:49,519
there is an even stronger principle that

324
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:52,319
is called the law of unity

325
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:53,279
which can override cues from this to

326
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:57,839
principle

327
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:57,839
and actually the thing is that if we are

328
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:04,239
linking consecutive objects by lines or

329
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:07,920
by borders or by background color we can

330
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:09,839
suggest somehow that they are related

331
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:11,279
and here is an example so for example if

332
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:13,600
you're in activity stream

333
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:15,040
if you just separate with with lines uh

334
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:18,399
people represent this as an

335
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:21,760
entry or that could be a logging form

336
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:23,760
uh just to note here is that we might be

337
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,560
very tempted to use these borders and

338
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,880
lines but

339
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,920
the more borders we use the interface

340
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,800
would look

341
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:31,439
more crowded so in the past years we've

342
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:34,240
seen

343
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:35,360
a fallback instead of law of unity on on

344
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,600
the proximity

345
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:39,040
so the designs are more airy and they're

346
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:42,720
using more white space

347
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:45,360
and they're more more relaxed

348
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,880
and just rely on on the proximity not

349
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:49,600
just on on this

350
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,600
on these queues

351
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:56,000
okay choice paralysis

352
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,279
it's a principle that states that um if

353
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,680
you give the user

354
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:00,480
lots of choices they might not know

355
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:03,279
which one

356
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,920
is best for them and there's another law

357
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:06,240
which is called

358
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,599
hicks law that states that the time to

359
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,760
make a decision increases with the

360
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:12,160
number and complexity of choices

361
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,920
and what we can do about this is to try

362
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:17,279
to limit the choices we're often

363
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:18,800
offering to the user to clearly mark

364
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:20,880
what are the differences

365
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,639
we can apply this for example if in our

366
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:24,880
software there are multiple

367
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:25,920
download versions so we should not

368
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:29,200
represent them

369
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:31,199
all the same um be

370
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,800
very clear actually if we can limit just

371
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,000
the two and maybe if there are some

372
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:36,240
advanced things just put them

373
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,440
aside i know we want to show all all the

374
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,839
options we have

375
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,880
but it's better for them to to get a

376
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:44,399
recommendation

377
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:48,959
and know exactly what we should expect

378
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:51,920
them to to pick from from that

379
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:53,518
and a similar rule to this is the seven

380
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,760
plus minister rule so

381
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:58,399
a century ago miller did some

382
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,399
experiments

383
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,680
i thought you were making pictures so

384
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,600
that's why i ignored you for a

385
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:10,638
long time okay uh so miller's rule

386
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:13,360
uh he was having a lot of

387
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:13,760
people and did research he was giving

388
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:17,360
them

389
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:19,279
like lots of words and try to see

390
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:21,199
for the short-term and long-term memory

391
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:24,399
how much how many of those words

392
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:25,439
users remembered and the average at that

393
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:29,600
time was like

394
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,600
seven plus minutes to word

395
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:34,319
in theory designers use this rule to

396
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,560
always say that we should not never have

397
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,240
more than more items in the menus and

398
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:42,880
all the websites should should have this

399
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:42,880
uh this limit but researchers have uh

400
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:46,719
redone the research more recently and

401
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:49,519
the the

402
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,240
value change from a four plus minus one

403
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:52,480
uh

404
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,760
there's no clear conclusion on how many

405
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,320
items there should be

406
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,800
the the point is to have as few in order

407
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:01,519
to

408
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:01,519
to be as easy as easy to be to be used

409
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:06,639
okay and uh there's a principle that is

410
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,319
called serial position effect

411
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:09,839
uh if you think let's say at the

412
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,920
alphabet you know

413
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:13,360
that it starts with a and then ends with

414
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:15,839
the z but you don't actually

415
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,399
i mean maybe you do but some of us have

416
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:18,720
trouble

417
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:19,839
remembering exactly what's inside this

418
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,880
the sequence

419
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:25,440
and um this principle can be uh

420
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:26,160
correlated with chunking so for example

421
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:29,279
if you would

422
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:30,079
need to have like nine items in a

423
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:32,560
navigation

424
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:33,839
um in the navigation bar you could split

425
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:36,319
them in groups of

426
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:37,839
of three in this way you will have a

427
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,120
first and the last for each of the

428
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:41,199
groups and they will be

429
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,240
easier to scan and easier to remember

430
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:44,160
and and also

431
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,920
they should be correlated and related

432
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:49,759
not just not just

433
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:51,839
placed there and the

434
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:53,440
chunking is actually very useful also

435
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:55,040
for form elements so

436
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,560
i don't know if you have have a card

437
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:59,040
number you should

438
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:00,880
chunk them people when they are trying

439
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:03,599
to remember their phone

440
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:06,720
number they are usually splitting in

441
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:09,440
sequences of two or three

442
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,560
so uh it's much easier for for the user

443
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:13,519
to to know exactly

444
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:14,800
what information they should enter and

445
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:17,440
um

446
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:19,279
regarding easiness for example here is

447
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:22,480
an example with a zip code

448
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:25,199
but the most classical example uh it's

449
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:26,240
when you enter the the card details when

450
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:29,439
you do a payment

451
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:31,279
and if a user sees an input of

452
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,480
three digits he might knows that that's

453
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:34,480
the cvs that he

454
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:37,120
needs to take from the back of the card

455
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:38,399
so it will be much easier for for them

456
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,880
to fill the

457
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,880
the form

458
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,639
here if you place the labels on top

459
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:48,800
again it will help

460
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:50,399
with visual visual vertical scanning

461
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,240
highlight and explain the error in the

462
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:55,759
context

463
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:58,320
some applications have a generic

464
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:59,040
zone where they place the error message

465
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,560
and it's

466
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,480
much easier to implement like that or

467
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:04,879
with alerts or with toast

468
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,000
but for the user it's much more clear

469
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:08,480
exactly where he did

470
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,359
the mistakes and also provide the hint

471
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,480
of

472
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:15,520
what what he should fix

473
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:18,720
and if we are using

474
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:20,879
some white inputs on something that is

475
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:22,400
that has a light background like it's

476
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:25,439
here um

477
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:27,120
the user will have triggered the

478
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:29,520
he will want to fill in the blanks so if

479
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:32,479
he sees something white then

480
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:35,200
he would like to to to fill it and

481
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:38,160
that's how you can increase maybe

482
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:40,559
some forms that have some optional

483
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,559
fields

484
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:48,160
okay i've seen a lot of times

485
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:51,120
when we have numbers that they are

486
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:52,320
left aligned or centered and the rule is

487
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:55,199
to have them

488
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:56,799
right the line because if you have

489
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:59,520
decimals and hundreds

490
00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:01,760
it's much easier to compare from one to

491
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:05,440
another

492
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:07,520
and this exclusively not exclusively but

493
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:08,960
it's even more important on tables when

494
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:11,520
you have quantitative data

495
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:12,799
so uh you can then apply them to to

496
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:15,918
currency or

497
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:18,240
even to to date and make sure that

498
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:19,280
the dates have the same format so it's

499
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:22,320
easy to scan

500
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:25,918
months and and and

501
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:28,399
days and here i've also used uh

502
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:30,640
easy to digest the date format because

503
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:33,039
we don't want to see those long

504
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:35,679
formats that we usually see in our

505
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:35,679
interfaces

506
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:42,000
icons are very important but try to

507
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:44,080
remember that icons are not universal

508
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,120
people might look at this icon and think

509
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:49,199
that it's a search

510
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:51,760
but it could also be a zoom because uh

511
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:53,919
maps you used it too or they could think

512
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,720
it's a ping-pong paddle and they have

513
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:57,520
been

514
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:59,200
tested in certain research on this so

515
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:01,200
depends on your privacy

516
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,480
previous knowledge with with icons you

517
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:05,760
might understand them

518
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:09,200
differently but uh

519
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:11,600
icons help instead of just having the

520
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,720
the names the first time you will see

521
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:15,360
them you will not

522
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:17,280
know what exactly that icon means but on

523
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,600
subsequential uses you will understand

524
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,760
that

525
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:21,120
that means i don't know recent tabs or

526
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:23,520
downloads and

527
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,399
you will just jump at it recognizing the

528
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:29,360
icons and

529
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:29,360
not needing to to read the the text

530
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:35,679
okay i know i've went very fast

531
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,799
and there are two books i can recommend

532
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:39,679
if you want to

533
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:40,960
learn more principles of design and the

534
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:43,360
refactoring

535
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:46,400
it's more of tips and tricks from a

536
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:46,399
designer point of view

537
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:56,160
okay the slides are alone on

538
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:56,159
so if you have any questions

539
00:19:56,210 --> 00:20:01,329
[Applause]

540
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:11,039
excellent so we have let me

541
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:14,639
check the schedule

542
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:16,158
we have 30 seconds time for a couple of

543
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:18,080
questions because we've got lots of

544
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:20,799
people outside and we need to do the

545
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,799
whole turnover

546
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:26,799
so yes i use uh sphinx documentation for

547
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,720
my open source project okay

548
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:30,960
and so i'm using the default template

549
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,360
okay it's i'm pretty sure like a lot of

550
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,200
people

551
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:35,280
who put some effort on doing it really

552
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:37,679
like the most generic nice template

553
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:38,399
but i feel something is definitely wrong

554
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:40,480
with it

555
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:42,320
and as a developer i cannot say like

556
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:44,159
what's wrong with it but i would like to

557
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:45,918
get it fixed somehow because like a big

558
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:48,400
team is using the same

559
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:50,480
template for documentation like could

560
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:53,039
you make any comments

561
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:54,799
so in general uh open source projects

562
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:56,000
tend to do generic things and things

563
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:59,440
that are scalable

564
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:02,320
and the the base for for theming so

565
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:04,240
this is not necessarily wrong but you

566
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:06,960
can do customizations on top right

567
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:08,080
and my suggestion is identify what's the

568
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:10,400
problem you

569
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:12,320
you can do that by asking a designer or

570
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,799
as actually asking other people what

571
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,639
they think

572
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:16,080
it's wrong with it because i don't know

573
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,600
what is wrong you can make a pull

574
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:21,199
request and try to fix it

575
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:23,120
or just do a theming for it and theming

576
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,960
can be diverse because we all have

577
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:28,399
different purposes so

578
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:31,360
it might work i don't know for

579
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:32,799
for the not dark mode or but theming

580
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,840
should be supported in mostly because

581
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:37,760
there are people that are

582
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:44,320
color blind and ideally

583
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:44,960
yeah i don't know yes is there a

584
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,520
difference

585
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:49,360
in patterns recommended to be used for

586
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:51,039
example in various

587
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:53,760
industry applications for example a

588
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:58,320
specific set of patterns in

589
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:59,919
medical industry applications

590
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:03,439
is there a difference between those

591
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:05,760
categories or is just let's

592
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:07,919
use easily because it will create a

593
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:10,879
habit and everyone will use it but

594
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:13,200
then that doesn't raise the risk the

595
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,200
threat

596
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:18,960
yes okay so the question is that there

597
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:21,120
are different patterns for

598
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:22,400
for different industries and this is

599
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,918
kind of hard to respond

600
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,840
the thing is that there are common

601
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:26,799
things that all humans will understand

602
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:30,399
and will perceive

603
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:32,000
in psychological principles

604
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:34,080
it's very important to know your target

605
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,840
i mean if you if your target are

606
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:38,960
children or people under

607
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:41,678
10 years old you will apply

608
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:42,000
some patterns compared to some someone

609
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:44,880
in

610
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,760
pharmacy pharmaceutical industry or i

611
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:49,120
don't know

612
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:51,200
so yes industry come with some

613
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:53,039
patterns but they're not you will not

614
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,240
find the website that will list them on

615
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:55,840
on domains

616
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:57,440
on the web we will have have patterns

617
00:22:55,840 --> 00:23:00,959
like i don't know wizards and how the

618
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,960
search results should look like but

619
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:09,840
i don't know any of them but i would be

620
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:09,840
very interesting to know if they are

621
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:28,720
yeah so like we have the good patterns

622
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,640
there's

623
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:32,320
this other category that are called dark

624
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:33,760
patterns and yes

625
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:35,439
there are a lot of research and people

626
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:38,480
that are trying to to

627
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:41,520
combat this uh they're usually

628
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:44,080
um taking advantage of in in

629
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:45,840
advertising and making people sell or or

630
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,480
buy things that they don't want or book

631
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:49,439
things

632
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:51,520
uh but that's not technical then any

633
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,159
good designer would not want to apply

634
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:55,600
those path

635
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:57,440
turns but yeah you cannot force somebody

636
00:23:55,600 --> 00:24:01,039
to to apply them or not but

637
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:01,039
they shouldn't it's not recommended

638
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:06,880
i have a question so yep i've seen that

639
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:09,120
higgs law being abused so badly

640
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:11,520
the what hicks law oh yeah okay being

641
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:13,120
obvious like to sell me

642
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:15,440
service providers like so hosting

643
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:16,879
companies or like but do designers take

644
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:18,480
an ethical standpoint like

645
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:21,120
oh i've got four options i'm gonna

646
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,120
highlight this

647
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:29,039
so ideally you should highlight it

648
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:30,639
because you you will have the user but

649
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:32,320
depends on your purposes i mean if you

650
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:34,159
know how to manipulate these rules yes

651
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:36,080
you can propose something you know

652
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:38,640
that is not beneficial to the user but

653
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:40,000
this depends on the moral values of the

654
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:42,480
designer

655
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,039
so yeah i don't know how to answer that

656
00:24:42,480 --> 00:25:00,320
okay

657
00:24:43,039 --> 00:25:00,320
um thank you so much
