dennis he's from the naturalis museum in

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,080
leiden who's leiden yeah in leiden and

6
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,480
he will uh

7
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:22,639
talk to us about the infrastructure

8
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:26,320
they've they've built there so uh

9
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:29,359
enjoy yes hello everyone

10
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:32,960
um this talk is about something entirely

11
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:36,079
different about dinosaurs

12
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,360
and let's start with an introduction the

13
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:40,719
i mean you see

14
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:41,519
trixx which is an actual t-rex that

15
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:44,719
lived about

16
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,399
66 million years ago

17
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:48,480
and she is now one of the main

18
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:53,120
attractions in our

19
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:53,120
natural history history museum in leiden

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,239
also introducing myself a bit i'm living

21
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:03,440
and working in leiden as well

22
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:04,720
um i put it like i identify as a homo

23
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:08,640
sapiens

24
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:11,840
a meager 38 years of age

25
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,560
and i moved to leiden to study political

26
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:15,439
science

27
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,000
and i ended up as a member of the i.t

28
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:18,720
crowd

29
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,200
at nataralis a couple of them are

30
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,679
sitting over there as well

31
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,040
in my free time i work as a volunteer in

32
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:28,320
a social center called

33
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,520
freyplatzleiden so if you happen to be

34
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,798
in leiden

please come and visit us or contact me

36
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,880
if you want to organize an open source

37
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:40,560
event a hackathon or something

38
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:43,520
and talking about open source i've

39
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,479
i'm an open source enthusiast since ever

40
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:47,200
since installing

41
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:49,200
debian for this first time in 2004

42
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,360
already

43
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,439
and i've been coming to frostlam ever

44
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:57,039
since 2012 so this is my

45
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:57,439
ninth edition with my first talk here so

46
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,560
that's

47
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:04,719
quite nice and it's always been really

48
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:07,040
inspiring overwhelming sometimes and

49
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:08,399
for sure exhausting experience two days

50
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:12,800
of talks and talks

51
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:15,520
and information and as a result

52
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,080
uh the last couple of years we've

53
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,520
applied

54
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:25,120
all kinds of tools and practices

55
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:25,120
at nativalis inspired by talks at fosdem

56
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,840
and i think that's also a big part of

57
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:35,040
the job as

58
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,400
it operator is to actually trying to

59
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,599
determine

60
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:43,120
the right approach the right tools uh

61
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:46,319
and how to use them best for your job

62
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:48,959
and there's a really a lot like uh

63
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:49,599
because of the 800 talks or something

64
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,239
here at

65
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:52,238
fosdem

66
00:02:53,920 --> 00:03:01,518
so in this talk i want to present a

67
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,519
kind of a real real world use case

68
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:05,440
i skip skim through the program and a

69
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:08,239
lot of

70
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,879
developers are talking about what they

71
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:11,920
made

72
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:15,440
for for me for example as an operator

73
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:18,399
but this is the other perspective um

74
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,760
and i hope it's useful and i like to

75
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,280
give you a glimpse

76
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:24,079
of the way we dealt with the challenge

77
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,799
of

78
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:28,480
applying all those wonderful powerful

79
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:32,560
open source tools

80
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:35,599
to a um

81
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:38,959
to a domain that has been

82
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:42,399
up until recently really fixated on

83
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:42,400
proprietary solutions

84
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,879
and the goal of this talk is not to try

85
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:49,519
and paint as if we

86
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:50,720
have the ideal universal solution or

87
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:54,080
something

88
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,959
it's just uh i hope it's interesting for

89
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:58,720
you guys

90
00:03:54,959 --> 00:04:03,439
and girls to see how we managed

91
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:06,480
with the problems of building a museum

92
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:06,959
um and we're actually quite proud of

93
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,959
course

94
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,319
of what we achieved with our

95
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:13,519
implementation but it's

96
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:16,880
really far from perfect

97
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:19,120
um and i want to basically

98
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,238
after uh explaining a bit about the use

99
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,560
case

100
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:25,359
show uh tell me tell a bit more about

101
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:28,400
the circumstances we had to work in

102
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,600
uh our the approach we took the things

103
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:32,080
we achieved

104
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,880
the end result and and at the end i'll

105
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:36,320
have some

106
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:42,000
closing comments

107
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:45,040
so what was actually the use case

108
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,600
um we were asked to

109
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,560
deploy and manage an entirely new

110
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,600
natural history

111
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:54,800
history museum consisting of

112
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:56,160
10 exhibitions and experiences uh with

113
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,759
all kinds of

114
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,759
technologies like media players

115
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:03,360
projectors microcontrollers

116
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:06,639
interactives all that kind of stuff

117
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,639
a campus network

118
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,160
because it was a new building and all

119
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,720
the management tools

120
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,720
around that

121
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:20,400
and to get a bit of id about the

122
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:23,599
circumstances

123
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:25,599
a bit about our institute nataralis

124
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:29,520
biodiversity center

125
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:31,840
uh first and foremost we're a uh

126
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:33,280
the manager of the national natural

127
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:36,000
history collection

128
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:37,039
we have 40 million specimens stored in a

129
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,199
big tower

130
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:41,199
and also a new part of the building

131
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:50,000
with lots of old artifacts small insects

132
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:52,960
all elephants anything you can

133
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,600
can think of apart from that we are a

134
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,400
research

135
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,280
institute as well so like we have at

136
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,318
least 100

137
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:03,840
researchers doing all kinds of research

138
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:05,600
related to biodiversity and

139
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:08,799
we're in natural history museum which is

140
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:10,720
really popular with families and kids

141
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,800
but that poses a really fundamental

142
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,319
challenge for us as a support

143
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:18,400
organization because

144
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:19,680
basically the bio diversity in our

145
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,479
institute is kind of the

146
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:24,240
central theme and basically anything

147
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:26,960
people can think of what they can do

148
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,280
related to biodiversity they do so and

149
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,120
we

150
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,400
have to support that so building a

151
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,479
museum

152
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,520
having a cloud for researchers doing

153
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:35,599
their analysis

154
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:37,440
all that kind of stuff so that is

155
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,919
difficult to do everything

156
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,919
really well

157
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:46,560
starting the project

158
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,400
at start of the project we uh already

159
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,240
had

160
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,599
quite a bit of technical expertise

161
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:57,120
in-house so we have

162
00:06:53,599 --> 00:07:01,120
like an it department of 30 35 people

163
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:03,680
with operators developers support

164
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,560
uh and in the the operators were

165
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,479
relatively

166
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,759
well first in conflict management

167
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:11,280
already we used

168
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:15,120
puppet and foreman specifically

169
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:17,359
for deploying web services

170
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,319
of infrastructure based on openstack and

171
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:22,000
ceph

172
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:25,039
we've done some experiments

173
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:28,479
so to say on kubernetes

174
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:28,479
we also cancel these

175
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:35,120
and uh for example with uh uh

176
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,639
an analytics based on senzu the oak

177
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:39,919
stack graphana

178
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:41,440
so that's also not normal for a regular

179
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:46,639
museum doesn't have this

180
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:46,639
i.t stuff in the netherlands at least

181
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:54,400
as i mentioned we built a new museum and

182
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:58,319
what you can see here

183
00:07:54,400 --> 00:08:01,599
is the museum actually being constructed

184
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:04,639
the part on the left that's the

185
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:08,479
new part and that's

186
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:11,199
also the museum part it's completely new

187
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:12,159
and when actually running the project

188
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:15,520
this wasn't

189
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:17,680
ready so we had to start building stuff

190
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:19,758
when we couldn't actually access the

191
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:22,400
building

192
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:23,360
or when we it wasn't even completely

193
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,318
finished

194
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,840
when we started building stuff in the

195
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:30,960
building

196
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:32,240
and apart from that we had to work

197
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:35,039
together

198
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:38,080
we worked together with an internal

199
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:38,080
museum department

200
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,839
which was really used to working with

201
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:45,279
suppliers

202
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:46,000
that just were fixated on proprietary

203
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:48,080
solutions

204
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,800
media players all kinds of show

205
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,800
controllers

206
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:56,480
and in general the museum building

207
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:59,839
industry if you can call it that

208
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:01,760
is well on a positive note it's just

209
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:09,120
starting to be influenced by

210
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:11,680
best practices from i.t and devops

211
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:13,360
i put their cattle versus pets it's like

212
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:15,680
a big question mark for them and they

213
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,279
didn't even consider it's like

214
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,760
everything in the museum is considered

215
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:20,959
like a

216
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:23,120
this special special thing and they

217
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:24,000
basically are used to just making that

218
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,640
thing

219
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,440
and then uh well here you have it and

220
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:31,040
you

221
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:35,440
you maintain it or something so

222
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:37,839
um also in a museum uh

223
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,120
you have to deal with a broad set of

224
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:41,680
technologies

225
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,720
as i mentioned earlier video players

226
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:46,160
unity games

227
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,160
in this uh

228
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:53,600
instance show controllers knx gateways

229
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:58,000
microcontroller all kinds of stuff

230
00:09:53,600 --> 00:10:00,720
and of course with a tight schedule

231
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,040
also known as no proper time for testing

232
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:06,160
we used to have a testing phase but

233
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:08,480
it got squashed

234
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:10,800
and basically we didn't have any testing

235
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,800
phase

236
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:18,160
so in similar situations

237
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,839
in other museums basically museum would

238
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:22,319
hire an external company or

239
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:22,880
several companies would then build and

240
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,880
deliver

241
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:29,519
a infrastructure if you're lucky

242
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,880
according you could set requirements as

243
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:33,600
an internal support

244
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,720
organization and then if you're actually

245
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,200
really lucky

246
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,320
it they would deliver something that

247
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,279
integrates with

248
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,279
the other things you do

249
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:46,079
so in an effort to keep the diversity of

250
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:48,560
technologies

251
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:49,680
that we have to manage to keep that down

252
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:52,560
and limited

253
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:53,680
our approach was to actually build on

254
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:57,760
the existing

255
00:10:53,680 --> 00:11:00,560
infrastructure and know how within the

256
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:02,480
organization and to get involved really

257
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:05,839
early in the process

258
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:09,680
with a bit of a struggle to keep

259
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:12,399
to get that message across internally uh

260
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:13,519
yeah so there was quite a bit of

261
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:17,360
politics

262
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:21,120
involved but we

263
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:23,600
we just hold on to our ideas

264
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,480
and as a publicly funded institute i

265
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:28,320
think that's

266
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:29,839
also really important and just believing

267
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,959
in the power of free and open source

268
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:34,240
software

269
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:38,719
our aim was to use as much

270
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:38,720
open source components as feasible

271
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:46,480
and and to combine this with a infras

272
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:50,079
code and devops practice

273
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:53,519
so ideally our idea was that basically

274
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:55,920
every variable that actually determines

275
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:57,279
the workings of the museum we would have

276
00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:00,000
under control

277
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:00,880
under version control and have it

278
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,360
managed

279
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:06,880
that was our ideal to make everything

280
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,880
like deployments repeatable

281
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:13,839
so quite early in the process we made

282
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:16,000
this kind of architecture diagram

283
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:17,120
to make a bit of an overview i'll go

284
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,160
over it

285
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:23,279
uh quickly

286
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:26,800
the the basically the issue was that

287
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:30,399
on the top you see

288
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:32,240
different groups

289
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:34,240
these are not the visitors but the users

290
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:36,240
of the management

291
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,360
or the technical infrastructure so to

292
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:40,480
say but

293
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:41,279
also those are a diverse group and on

294
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,920
the bottom

295
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:45,120
you see let's say an illustration of the

296
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:49,839
diversity of

297
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:53,279
all the equipment we had to to manage

298
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:55,519
the blue line involves quite a bit of

299
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:56,639
open source management tools i won't go

300
00:12:55,519 --> 00:13:01,040
too into

301
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:01,040
too much details about those

302
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,560
we use gitlab for version control

303
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:07,040
metamodes for

304
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:09,920
kind of chat ops you go for a

305
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,920
documentation

306
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:14,800
next cloud for content management sends

307
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,040
in prometheus for

308
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,839
monitoring and also we have to use stop

309
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:20,560
disks

310
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,560
for some reason

311
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:26,000
and of course in the middle of it all is

312
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:30,160
ansible awx

313
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:32,240
it's kind of uh basically the design is

314
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:35,439
put ansible in the center and make it

315
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:37,839
like the lingua franca of the of our

316
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:40,880
automation

317
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:43,120
and it was this this

318
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:44,560
diagram didn't really change much during

319
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,560
the

320
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:48,560
during the project it's kind of filling

321
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:51,199
in the boxes so it was a

322
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:52,800
useful overview also to explain to

323
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:54,639
others in the organization

324
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,800
okay this is roughly what we're going to

325
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:59,519
build

326
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:00,719
and also the choice for ansible we

327
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:02,800
didn't have

328
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:05,680
too much experience with ansible at the

329
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,680
start of the project

330
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,880
but we have to i'm going to admit

331
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:12,000
something here

332
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:16,399
we have worked for a

333
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:19,680
another museum in in leiden museum

334
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:21,440
and that was a bit of our guinea pig

335
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:24,399
testing ground i'm not sure if they're

336
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,399
watching but

337
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:29,440
now basically we they asked us to help

338
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:31,600
out with their new exhibition

339
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:33,040
but there we got involved really late in

340
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,560
the process so basically there was

341
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:37,599
already a supplier

342
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:38,560
and he had already installed ubuntu

343
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,519
linux

344
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:42,959
on computers by hand and then we had to

345
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:45,040
deploy the applications

346
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:47,359
so what we did was just make a simple

347
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:50,800
inventory of all those computers

348
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:51,600
and with some ansible playbooks we could

349
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:54,160
actually

350
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:56,560
manage that part and i think that's an

351
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:58,959
important feature

352
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,680
although we we couldn't we didn't have

353
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:02,160
control

354
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:03,279
on the whole situation we could manage

355
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:06,000
quite well that

356
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:06,639
specific thing and ansible allowed us to

357
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,480
do that

358
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:13,440
it wasn't an or nothing situation

359
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:15,680
and the choice for ansible also was that

360
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,680
um

361
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:20,399
it was really the most popular conflict

362
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:23,439
management tool for

363
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:27,440
network automation so

364
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:29,600
the um the promise of being able to

365
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:31,600
use the same conflict management tool

366
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,920
for basically across the

367
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,120
entire spectrum of the museum and maybe

368
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,639
even the

369
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,959
rest of our infrastructure that was

370
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:42,240
really appealing for us

371
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:44,880
so i'm not going to try to get

372
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:47,519
get give you an impression of how far we

373
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,519
got with that

374
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:55,279
so starting with deployment we have

375
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:56,160
the network switches we use cumulus

376
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:59,439
linux

377
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:01,279
for uh for the switches so those are

378
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:03,199
the idea is that you have white box

379
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:05,040
switches like servers

380
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:06,719
where you can install linux on the

381
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:09,839
switches

382
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,560
we use a a process for deploying cumulus

383
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:12,880
linux

384
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:14,319
on those switches based on the only boot

385
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:17,600
loader and said

386
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:19,839
ztp like zero touch provisioning to get

387
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:23,279
cumulus linux on those switches

388
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:24,000
but as you remember we didn't have

389
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:27,120
access

390
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:30,720
to the building

391
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:34,480
and we also didn't have

392
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:36,880
switches so we started testing on

393
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:38,560
virtual machines because it's just

394
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:41,199
debian basically

395
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:42,319
we could just build the entire campus

396
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:45,599
network

397
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:46,560
uh in a virtual environment uh for

398
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,040
computers

399
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:50,160
so we have small form factor computers

400
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:52,480
for

401
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:53,600
all our interactives and media players

402
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:57,360
we deploy those

403
00:16:53,600 --> 00:17:01,199
with ubuntu metal as a service so we can

404
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:04,160
based on ansible scripts from awx

405
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:06,879
we can commission and deploy computers

406
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,880
from scratch

407
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:15,599
config management so for the

408
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:17,839
switches we have some base walls

409
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:19,359
that are shared between all the switches

410
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:22,240
and then we use template

411
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:24,240
templating ansible templates for the

412
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:27,520
spines of the core switches

413
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:28,799
and for the leaf switches a lot of

414
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:31,760
vendors have their

415
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:35,120
specific ansible modules with cumulus

416
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:38,559
linux we could just use templates

417
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:42,320
the same for our computers so we have

418
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:44,080
several base roles like for the intel

419
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:46,720
all the interactive computers museum

420
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:50,399
computers and then on top of them

421
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:54,000
we would deploy

422
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:55,120
games in basically we all run unity 3d

423
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:59,039
games because

424
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:59,039
they don't make anything else

425
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:06,719
mpv for media players and chromium

426
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,719
based digital signage

427
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:12,840
but also we do content provisioning

428
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,480
well not on the switches but on the

429
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:18,000
computers uh

430
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:19,280
we selected next cloud so we would have

431
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,000
a place for

432
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:24,000
our content provider software providers

433
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:27,280
to put the content on

434
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:29,840
and then with a small script we have

435
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:34,000
item potent

436
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:36,879
content updates on the computers

437
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,280
and based on that we do also some kind

438
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:40,240
of

439
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:40,879
orchestration workflows for example that

440
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:44,240
in one

441
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:44,960
workflow we would configure a network

442
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,280
port

443
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:49,120
for a specific device in the museum and

444
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:52,480
then actually deploy

445
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:54,719
the computer from scratch ubuntu linux

446
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:56,000
all the the specific role of that

447
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:58,880
computer the content

448
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,080
of it and at the end of the process you

449
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,320
would have a functioning

450
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,320
thing

451
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:09,520
but yeah we got started with automation

452
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,960
and then we thought okay we have also

453
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:14,639
microcontrollers

454
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:18,080
running arduino so we selected

455
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:19,280
platform io to actually deploy the

456
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:22,000
firmware

457
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:22,639
on the microcontrollers as well so we

458
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,440
typically

459
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,559
would have a computer with an arduino

460
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:30,559
microcontroller

461
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:32,799
connected to it mostly usb based

462
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:33,678
and then basically as part of the

463
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:36,559
deployment

464
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:37,280
it would also deploy the specific

465
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:40,399
firmware

466
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:44,320
for that setup we

467
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:47,200
manage uh projectors unfortunately

468
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:49,039
the suppliers of the projectors don't

469
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,840
have like open firmware or something

470
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:52,480
like that

471
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:53,760
on the projectors but also we didn't

472
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:56,080
implement that

473
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:58,000
but we did some basics like the network

474
00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:02,480
configuration of those things

475
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,480
sends you checks on it turning

476
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:06,240
as a part of the workflows turning on

477
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,760
and off the

478
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,840
the projectors when starting an

479
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:13,600
exhibition stuff like that

480
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:17,280
and also for example we have a knx

481
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:17,280
gateway to actually

482
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,679
stop or start the power supply in a

483
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,799
exhibition

484
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:26,320
stuff like that and we actually did that

485
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:29,679
by mapping

486
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:32,879
knx data points or addresses

487
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:36,640
to ansible hosts so you can use the

488
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,640
groupings in ansible

489
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:42,960
just like you used to so as you can see

490
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:44,080
it's already quite a bit of scope and

491
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:48,159
the nice thing is

492
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:51,360
we use awx ansible tower

493
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:52,320
uh to actually delegate this whole

494
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:55,678
package

495
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:57,918
to uh to uh

496
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:59,280
personnel who isn't experienced in all

497
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:02,640
this automation stuff

498
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:03,440
so for example turning on the entire

499
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:07,360
museum

500
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:08,559
is done from awx by someone who works

501
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:12,240
for the security

502
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:13,039
every morning and we can also just

503
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:16,400
schedule it

504
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:17,840
redeploy something entirely from scratch

505
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:21,840
it's six in the morning before the

506
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:24,959
museum starts we can do that

507
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:25,760
so and this is kind of the end result so

508
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:30,159
we have uh

509
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:34,080
uh this is one of the exhibitions

510
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:38,080
about geology we have a ice age

511
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:42,080
exhibition with with games and

512
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:44,240
and microcontrollers projections based

513
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:47,280
on mpv

514
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:47,280
and plenty more

515
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:55,440
so to wrap to wrap things up

516
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:58,799
i think in general i think

517
00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:01,200
what we learned at least is that

518
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:02,158
our specific local circumstances are

519
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:06,799
really

520
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:09,280
really vital to for the choices you make

521
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:10,879
technical and organizational choices we

522
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:14,320
make

523
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:17,440
for us uh a kind of

524
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:19,918
relative simple and first dollar tool is

525
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:22,320
really ideal for organizations like us

526
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:24,480
who has to support a really wide range

527
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:27,840
of services

528
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:31,679
and also ansible is really

529
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:34,399
suitable for uh and forgiving

530
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:35,440
for imperfect environments so you don't

531
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:38,960
have to

532
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:43,200
fit your entire world into kind of the

533
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:46,640
paradigm of the tool uh ansible so like

534
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:49,039
uh forgiving and simple that it

535
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:50,159
it can work in an imperfect environment

536
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:52,480
as well

537
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:54,159
and of course although we did not

538
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:56,960
succeed using open source

539
00:22:54,159 --> 00:23:00,159
tools for every aspect of the museum i

540
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:00,159
think we came pretty far

541
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:08,879
so to conclude i think dinosaurs

542
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:09,520
are definitely doomed because even in

543
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,600
the

544
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,799
these kind of challenge challenging

545
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:15,840
circumstances like

546
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:18,639
tight schedule a a

547
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:20,840
sector that's not really uh happy to

548
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:23,600
change their ways in

549
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:26,000
proprietary solutions uh

550
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:28,158
i think our case shows that it's even in

551
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:31,840
the in those circumstances

552
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:36,880
possible to give the proverb proverbial

553
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:39,120
dinosaurs of your industry the boot so

554
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,960
if you want to know more we can have a

555
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:43,760
chat

556
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:44,400
there's two more presentations about the

557
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:46,480
museum

558
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,679
tomorrow i'll give a lightning talk

559
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:51,120
about our usage of

560
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:54,000
mpv on monday on

561
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:55,279
i do a talk on config management camp

562
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,159
i'll go a bit

563
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:59,840
it's like the sequel of the dinosaurs

564
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:02,559
are doomed one

565
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:04,080
and i'll go a bit more into detail about

566
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:07,120
our workflows

567
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:10,158
you can come and visit us in the museum

568
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:10,158
or check out our code

569
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:19,840
thank you
