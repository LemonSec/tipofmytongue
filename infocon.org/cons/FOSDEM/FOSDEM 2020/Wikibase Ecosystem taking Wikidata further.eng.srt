1
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:09,660
we're going to talk about the wiki based

2
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:15,200
ecosystem indeed we're going to talk

3
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:15,200
about editable link data for everyone

4
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:38,269
yeah it all started with wiki data wiki

5
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:40,250
data is Wikimedia is knowledgebase and

6
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:44,390
it provides general structured data

7
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:46,370
about the world to Wikipedia so when you

8
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:52,660
look at the Wikipedia article today and

9
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:55,459
you see the info box on the side with

10
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:59,000
basic facts about the topic you're

11
00:00:55,460 --> 00:01:02,900
reading about then that might come from

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:07,690
wiki data and it's a central place that

13
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:09,679
stores all this data for Wikipedia in a

14
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:12,170
language independent way so that

15
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:15,560
everyone all the Wikipedia language

16
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:21,729
traditions can benefit from it and wicca

17
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:26,420
data has become rather successful after

18
00:01:21,729 --> 00:01:31,070
seven years of it existing now we have

19
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:36,649
around 12,500 people who edit at least

20
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:40,428
once at least five times a month and we

21
00:01:36,649 --> 00:01:42,950
describe almost 75 million things in the

22
00:01:40,429 --> 00:01:44,899
world like this could be this building

23
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:48,740
this could be Brussels this could be a

24
00:01:44,899 --> 00:01:56,569
famous actor this could be a movie

25
00:01:48,740 --> 00:02:01,160
things like that how does this look like

26
00:01:56,569 --> 00:02:04,520
in practice when you go to wicked era

27
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:07,880
today you might find pages like this one

28
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:11,870
about Margaret Hamilton and find out

29
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:15,400
that she was an American NASA scientist

30
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:18,170
and mathematician that there are 41

31
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:24,370
different language versions of Wikipedia

32
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:27,109
who have an article about her and if you

33
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:32,540
didn't know that yet she also was a

34
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:36,380
human but now you love machines who are

35
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:38,569
also supposed to notice for them that's

36
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:41,209
not quite so obvious so we record stuff

37
00:02:38,569 --> 00:02:42,530
like that as well and if you go further

38
00:02:41,209 --> 00:02:45,230
down a bit you will

39
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:48,760
and things like that she was developer

40
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:54,230
on the Apollo space program for example

41
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:57,140
and if you go even further you will find

42
00:02:54,230 --> 00:03:02,829
links to a ton of other places on the

43
00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:06,500
internet other websites other catalogs

44
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:08,560
libraries and so on where you find more

45
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:13,610
information about her

46
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:17,060
and now imagine that all nearly 75

47
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:21,650
million times about many different

48
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:23,900
things so this is what it looked like at

49
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:26,660
the beginning right you have wiki data

50
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:29,050
in the middle and it provides data to

51
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:33,140
these other Wikimedia projects like

52
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:40,280
Wikipedia wikivoyage Wikimedia Commons

53
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:44,200
and many others and then with all these

54
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:47,600
connections to these other databases we

55
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:50,268
build up a Semantic Web or a part of the

56
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:52,910
Semantic Web that connects all this

57
00:03:50,269 --> 00:03:58,070
information both readable by humans but

58
00:03:52,910 --> 00:04:00,470
also by machines and this is then used

59
00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:02,390
by for example your personal assistant

60
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:06,440
digital assistant to answer your

61
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:09,440
questions or if you get a quick answer

62
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:12,380
in your search results that might be

63
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:14,239
powered by that or your local library

64
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:17,000
system might provide you with additional

65
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:18,709
information about the author and their

66
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:23,300
books and then that might also come from

67
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:26,840
there now with Weka data

68
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:31,300
quietly gaining a lot of traction and

69
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:35,169
attention we had a problem because all

70
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:40,880
this data is maintained by a community

71
00:04:35,169 --> 00:04:43,880
for the world and we reached a point

72
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:46,880
where lots and lots of people wanted to

73
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:50,229
put more and more specialized data into

74
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:52,430
wiki data without necessarily being

75
00:04:50,229 --> 00:04:54,909
willing and able to maintain that over

76
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:54,909
the long run

77
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:59,750
and we said like wicked a there should

78
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:01,940
be a very central place in the Semantic

79
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:05,210
Web but it shouldn't have all the data

80
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:07,490
because that's not what the Semantic Web

81
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:11,409
was about writes about decentralizing

82
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:11,410
and connecting and linking information

83
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:19,730
so lots of people approached us like can

84
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:23,860
we run our own thing can't we run our

85
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:26,330
own wiki data and that's what we made

86
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:28,610
possible so the software that's running

87
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:30,979
wiki data is called wiki base and over

88
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:33,320
the last two years we have put a lot of

89
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:36,800
work into making it possible for other

90
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:39,290
people organizations companies to run

91
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:42,620
their own wiki base with the idea that

92
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:45,200
at some point we have a picture that

93
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:47,960
looks like this which would be the wiki

94
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:50,060
based ecosystem where all the data that

95
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:53,000
we already have and all the data that we

96
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:56,440
already connect to it's further enriched

97
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:59,720
and connected to many different

98
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:02,590
individual wiki's that publish

99
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:06,100
specialized data so you could imagine

100
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:08,840
there's famous German marmalade producer

101
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:10,760
they have lots of marmalade germs and

102
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:12,919
chutneys and they might have their own

103
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:15,260
wiki base about Marlon's gems and

104
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:17,900
chutneys where they describe all the

105
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:20,840
ingredients and how they connect to

106
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:24,890
other varieties of the same marmalade

107
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:27,200
for example and then if you're really

108
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:29,180
interested in mallets you go to that

109
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:31,810
wiki and find all the information you

110
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:31,810
could ever ask for

111
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:40,969
so since we've been doing this there are

112
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:43,489
quite a few installations out there

113
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:46,790
already that do really cool stuff with

114
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:49,640
wiki base and connected to wiki data and

115
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:53,180
other wiki base installations this for

116
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:56,510
example is a lingua Libre lingua Libre

117
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:59,360
is a project to help people record

118
00:06:56,510 --> 00:07:01,280
pronunciations so that other people who

119
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:05,930
don't speak their language can hear how

120
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:07,760
a word is pronounced and they structure

121
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:08,900
their word lists and their connections

122
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,340
to wiki data

123
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:16,520
through their own wiki-based instance

124
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:19,340
for example or we have sacred which is a

125
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:21,859
database that collects data about the

126
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:24,409
humanities and they started out with

127
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:26,060
data about the Illuminati yes this is a

128
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:32,860
real thing

129
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:32,860
so they recorded things like all always

130
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:38,120
anonymous people wrote to other

131
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:38,780
anonymous people also who was behind

132
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:42,229
this

133
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:44,989
when did they write to each other what

134
00:07:42,229 --> 00:07:46,699
did they write about and you can once

135
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:48,710
you have all that data connected and

136
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:51,560
queryable it becomes really interesting

137
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:54,440
to ask questions about it'll be not you

138
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:56,780
for example by now they expanded into

139
00:07:54,440 --> 00:08:02,500
other humanities data as well but that's

140
00:07:56,780 --> 00:08:08,859
how they started or you have rhizome

141
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:14,000
which is a museum for digital born art

142
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:17,510
you might remember some at the beginning

143
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:20,060
of the web and as it grew artists have

144
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:24,740
played with for example technical

145
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:30,139
glitches and browsers exploiting box and

146
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:32,209
so on to create art and that art is

147
00:08:30,139 --> 00:08:35,419
preserved by this organization called

148
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:37,250
rhizome who is now cataloging it in

149
00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:39,409
their own wiki base instance to make it

150
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:41,750
easier to find to figure out which

151
00:08:39,409 --> 00:08:43,669
browser version in which operating

152
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:45,860
system you need to use to actually be

153
00:08:43,669 --> 00:08:54,079
able to see what the artist had intended

154
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:57,080
and so on or we have wiki base instant

155
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,970
called personal data i/o and they are

156
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:02,480
trying to do something about

157
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:04,670
surveillance capitalism by helping

158
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:09,020
people have conversations about it by

159
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:12,620
exposing how personal data is used by

160
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:18,829
connecting organizations that that fight

161
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:21,900
against and provide alternatives very

162
00:09:18,829 --> 00:09:26,430
worthy goal in my opinion

163
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:28,500
and then to sum up the the few showcases

164
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:30,390
we're currently working with a lot of

165
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:32,460
national libraries for example the

166
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:36,650
German National Library the French

167
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:41,790
National Library as well as some library

168
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:46,829
groups on trialing wiki base as a system

169
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:52,380
for their own internal cataloging

170
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:53,880
systems or as documentation to that now

171
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:55,680
you might think why are all these people

172
00:09:53,880 --> 00:10:00,150
using wiki base what makes it special

173
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:03,089
and there's many reasons for that but

174
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:05,280
let me highlight some the first one is

175
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:08,580
that it's actually added to polling data

176
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:11,910
like Wikipedia you can enable your

177
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:15,510
editors your users to change your data

178
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:17,670
to contribute to it to augment it and a

179
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:19,710
lot of the existing link data that is

180
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:22,439
out there is read-only and this is a way

181
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:25,920
to change that and and give people the

182
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:27,690
power to support your cause or your

183
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:30,540
organization in contributing to it

184
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:37,130
through additional data to Corrections

185
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:41,610
and so on then thanks to its foundation

186
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:43,710
in Wikimedia it has community at the

187
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:46,650
core so there are many features in wiki

188
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:48,030
base already that help you build a

189
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:53,060
community and help that community

190
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:58,380
organize that is things like tor pages

191
00:10:53,060 --> 00:11:00,630
user rights and much more which existing

192
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:05,340
library systems for example have a very

193
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:07,970
hard time for writing the other thing

194
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:13,380
that's really important for people is

195
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:16,500
multilingual @ e so the screenshots I

196
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:18,270
showed you we're all in English but with

197
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:21,210
a click of a button I can show you the

198
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:23,280
very same data in German in French or in

199
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:24,630
any other language that you that you

200
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:27,990
would like and that someone has

201
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:31,100
contributed translations for but you're

202
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:31,100
working on the same data

203
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:38,930
and another thing that is really

204
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:41,240
intriguing people said wiki bases build

205
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:45,229
with the idea in mind that the world is

206
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:47,390
very complex and that we want to capture

207
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:51,590
that complexity and data and that is

208
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:56,060
very hard but I think we've gotten quite

209
00:11:51,590 --> 00:12:00,110
far in making that possible so the world

210
00:11:56,060 --> 00:12:02,689
is weird for example at some point

211
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:05,480
Sweden decided it would be really nice

212
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:10,570
to have a February serve Shetty's in

213
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:13,790
just one year because why not just so

214
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:18,470
the role that February only ever has 29

215
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:21,469
or last days nope there's the Swedes

216
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:25,480
broke that rule or there was this woman

217
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:25,480
who decided to marry the Eiffel Tower

218
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:30,020
the world's complex and these

219
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:31,370
complexities are exactly what

220
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:32,810
Wikipedians want to write about of

221
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:35,620
course right because other people want

222
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:38,209
to read about it so wiki base was built

223
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:41,240
to deal with that and to be able to

224
00:12:38,210 --> 00:12:46,940
express that flexibility and complexity

225
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:50,120
that the world has and the last thing I

226
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:54,320
want to mention is this is the

227
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:56,270
connection to wiki data if you are

228
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,940
running a wiki based instance then it's

229
00:12:56,270 --> 00:13:00,770
very easy to connect that to wiki data

230
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:05,240
and benefit from a lot of the work that

231
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:07,370
has been done there already in future we

232
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:11,930
want to make it very easy for example to

233
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:13,520
take over all the decisions that the

234
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:16,459
regulator community has already made

235
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:20,390
about how to model the world like the

236
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:22,490
fact that we want human to have a date

237
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:25,100
of birth in a place of birth and that is

238
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:27,530
something we want to express that should

239
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:30,800
be very easy to take over to your own

240
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:34,370
wiki base instance and the other thing

241
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:37,069
is that if organizations companies and

242
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:38,930
so on are using data from wiki data then

243
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:41,660
we want to make it very easy for them to

244
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:44,859
also jump to your wiki based instance

245
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:44,860
annuity basica system

246
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:49,960
and with that I hope I gave you a

247
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:52,360
glimpse into the wiki-based

248
00:13:49,960 --> 00:14:37,200
ecosystem and made you excited to try it

249
00:13:52,360 --> 00:14:39,820
and join us thank you so wicked data has

250
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:43,000
notability guidelines like most

251
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:46,440
Wikipedia's have they are very relaxed

252
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:49,320
but they're there and they basically say

253
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:53,760
anything that has a Wikipedia article

254
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:56,800
can have an entry in wiki data anything

255
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:59,890
that is described by a reliable source

256
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:02,680
out there like a library system for

257
00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:05,710
example can probably have an entry in

258
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:08,709
wiki data and anything that is needed to

259
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:14,080
fulfill all structural need so let's say

260
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:16,390
you have a famous person their child was

261
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:20,140
not famous but the child of that child

262
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:22,660
was famous then you can create an entry

263
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:27,340
for the person in the middle to complete

264
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:31,390
the chain basically that that's a rough

265
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:33,790
guideline and then there's the question

266
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:36,970
of how much information do we collect

267
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:38,110
about each of those things and for

268
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:43,000
example as I was saying earlier the

269
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:46,090
marmalade museum is probably too much

270
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,800
for for wiki data itself and probably

271
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:49,960
deserves its own wiki based instance

272
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:51,910
also because you can build up a

273
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:53,860
community of specialists who really care

274
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:55,959
about this particular topic and have a

275
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:58,000
lot of experience about it and know how

276
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:59,130
to model the difference between a

277
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:05,830
chutney and a mammal

278
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:08,560
and a gem which I do not yeah so and if

279
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:10,780
you're really unsure on wicket it's off

280
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:12,400
there is a discussion page where you can

281
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:22,110
bring it up and and get some input from

282
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:22,110
the editors yeah

283
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:32,430
how the collaboration between which

284
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:36,250
media and the libraries works so they

285
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:38,140
they have the ones we are working with

286
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:40,060
they have dedicated people inside the

287
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:42,160
library who are tasked with evaluating

288
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:45,760
wiki base for their particular use case

289
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:49,390
and then we regularly exchange with them

290
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:51,910
we have meetings with them to talk about

291
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:54,040
what they want from Becky Bayes if

292
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:57,969
that's already possible with it if we

293
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:59,410
need to make changes or if if wiki base

294
00:16:57,970 --> 00:17:03,520
for that particular case just isn't the

295
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:06,220
right thing to use and then over several

296
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:10,020
months we go through that every Asian

297
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:10,020
phase with them and support them in that

298
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:34,030
right so right now it's not just web

299
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:36,280
links but it's links and links in rdf

300
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:39,550
for example that you can follow as you

301
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:43,210
do in a Semantic Web we are working on

302
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:47,080
more advanced Federation features we're

303
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:49,360
starting now in two weeks or so to start

304
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:51,520
building more on top of that so that you

305
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:54,040
can take more advantage than you

306
00:17:51,520 --> 00:18:01,139
currently can on of this distributed

307
00:17:54,040 --> 00:18:01,139
Ness off of the whole ecosystem yes

308
00:18:16,269 --> 00:18:28,610
yeah so exactly because of things like

309
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:31,610
that and we have build wiki base not

310
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:35,479
around the idea of there's one truth out

311
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:39,889
there that we have to model but you can

312
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:46,070
have for example conflicting data you

313
00:18:39,889 --> 00:18:48,498
can have things like China claims that

314
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:52,330
everyone belongs to China and it's a

315
00:18:48,499 --> 00:18:56,240
part of it while Taiwan itself says no

316
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:58,309
and you can have those statements next

317
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,809
to each other and then you have

318
00:18:58,309 --> 00:19:04,240
something called qualifiers where you

319
00:18:59,809 --> 00:19:07,940
can qualify this for example saying that

320
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:11,450
this this particular statement is

321
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:14,779
supported by the United Nations or you

322
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:18,889
can say that this is based on a

323
00:19:14,779 --> 00:19:22,669
particular treaty for example or that

324
00:19:18,889 --> 00:19:26,209
something was true only from one point

325
00:19:22,669 --> 00:19:28,159
in time to another in the past so

326
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:32,779
there's a lot of flexibility in that

327
00:19:28,159 --> 00:19:34,759
it's of course not able to express all

328
00:19:32,779 --> 00:19:37,850
the complexity in the world that you can

329
00:19:34,759 --> 00:19:41,379
think of but it gets quite a lot farther

330
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:41,379
than typical databases

331
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:55,919
right so what we're starting to work on

332
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:59,040
now is the ability to use wiki data's

333
00:19:55,920 --> 00:20:01,440
properties and items to in your own wiki

334
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:04,280
base instance so that everyone would be

335
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:07,500
able to use the same vocabulary ideally

336
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:10,200
how that plays out we have to see but I

337
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:12,180
have high hopes yeah

338
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:15,180
so that that is the idea for now and of

339
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:18,810
course there's a lot of links and same s

340
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:21,150
links as understood in the Semantic Web

341
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:22,350
so that you can say okay if they are

342
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:25,020
talking about this concept that's the

343
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:37,490
same thing they are talking about and

344
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:44,540
then you can follow those yes

345
00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:48,870
so medium wikipedia has said - yeah

346
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:51,409
maybe Faden can help you understand more

347
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:55,889
of that but there's a change of stream

348
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:59,270
that you can follow both looking at a

349
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:59,270
website but also we are AP eyes

350
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:15,699
sorry I have a hard time understanding

351
00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:15,700
you yes

352
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:31,190
so the initial storing and editing of

353
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:35,330
the data happens in MediaWiki and then

354
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:37,880
for querying and answering more complex

355
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:41,919
questions on that data we have a spotter

356
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:58,280
endpoint and we use place graph for that

357
00:21:41,920 --> 00:22:01,190
place graph yes so we want to start in

358
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:04,910
the next two weeks and then roll out the

359
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:08,240
first version of that hopefully in very

360
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:10,310
few months depending on how it goes and

361
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:12,950
then iterate on that based on what

362
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:15,260
people tell us they need in addition so

363
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:17,810
the first version will be very simple

364
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:19,550
you will be able to use only the

365
00:22:17,810 --> 00:22:22,940
properties that wiki data provides like

366
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:25,730
date of birth place of birth links to

367
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:28,180
other databases and so on and then we'll

368
00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:28,180
build on that

369
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:47,410
do you have some way of dealing with so

370
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:51,960
wicked in itself right so we get it

371
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:55,300
itself as CC 0 so only data that is

372
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:57,790
licensed to 0 it's supposed to go into

373
00:22:55,300 --> 00:23:00,520
wicked data which is one of the reasons

374
00:22:57,790 --> 00:23:02,170
why organizations might decide to run

375
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:05,080
their own pretty business it's because

376
00:23:02,170 --> 00:23:09,580
they can't release their data under

377
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:11,169
under C 0 and then it would be up to the

378
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:12,879
consumer to decide because they see

379
00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:15,420
where the data is coming coming from and

380
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:19,230
that wiki has a has a license

381
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:21,210
declaration and I would then need to see

382
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:33,010
depending on how they use that data

383
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:33,190
comply with the license thank you very

384
00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:37,180
much

385
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:37,180
[Applause]
