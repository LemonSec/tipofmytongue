1
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:13,518
uh hello

2
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:15,518
and welcome to this talk about

3
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:18,000
free open source virtual reality and

4
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:21,119
augmented reality

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,240
my name is jacob ponogratz i currently

6
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:27,680
work for collabora

7
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:27,680
and i do basically open source xr

8
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,920
and what i'm going to talk about now is

9
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:34,880
basically explain a little bit what

10
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,000
uh ar and vr are uh a little bit about

11
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,320
open xr

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,079
about monado the project that we started

13
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,960
uh the status of it and show a little

14
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,000
bit of demos

15
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:49,280
and then wrap the whole thing up

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:52,399
yeah so what is ar and vr

17
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,399
as as you can see

18
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:56,959
augment like adding things making things

19
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:59,680
better

20
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,480
so one of the things that probably most

21
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,359
of you have

22
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,878
run into or seen is uh pokemon go where

23
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:06,479
you can sort of replace

24
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,240
pikachu or any other pokemon in the

25
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:10,240
world uh

26
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:12,399
and you know that's a or you add

27
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:14,640
something to the to the thing and you

28
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,960
give you know a new experience or things

29
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,119
like that um

30
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:21,039
but it can also be used for other things

31
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:22,000
uh not just games but also working

32
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:25,280
things

33
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,960
uh so this is a doctor headset

34
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,040
i'm going to explain a little about the

35
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:31,199
setup so the guy you see

36
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,320
in this sort of video call is sitting

37
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,840
somewhere else

38
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,559
and the operator that's wearing the

39
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,439
headset and is streaming what he sees to

40
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,960
that kind of

41
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:42,240
in the headset um so operator can i see

42
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,720
and it can also

43
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,360
then draw or you know highlight things

44
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,640
so

45
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:50,720
if you see that little let's see that

46
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,159
ring there that is actually you know not

47
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,158
something i scribbled on it's

48
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:56,960
what the operator scribbled on and like

49
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:58,799
told him to say pull this hard disk or

50
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,079
you know screw and tighten that screw so

51
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,719
exactly like how

52
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:03,279
i you know highlighted this with the

53
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:05,839
pointer

54
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,320
he can highlight things in real world so

55
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,360
that's

56
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:10,079
actually a very powerful thing that you

57
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,120
can do

58
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:15,520
with ar and you know it's not just

59
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,520
games

60
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:24,400
so what is virtual reality

61
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:25,760
uh i really like this quote uh i thought

62
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,200
it first but it was actually made by

63
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,160
adam sandwich but it's actually from a

64
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,119
video

65
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,920
or a movie and you might have heard it

66
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,239
uh

67
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,760
i really accurately substitute my own uh

68
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:36,480
which is kind of what virtual reality is

69
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,518
you just

70
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:41,920
replace everything um

71
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:44,000
but often what you think is you know a

72
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:46,480
vr headset and you just see things but

73
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,599
it can be a lot more than that but i'm

74
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:50,238
gonna like

75
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:50,959
limit myself to that definition and of

76
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:52,800
course

77
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:54,239
as you might know you know games where

78
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,720
you

79
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,319
you know play and you have different

80
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:02,159
experience

81
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:05,119
so by definition where you

82
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:06,159
are have replaced the whole reality um

83
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:10,480
there's also like

84
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:10,480
this is also by that you know

85
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,640
you know technical definition i would

86
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,560
say this is also virtual reality because

87
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,879
even though it's a limited experience

88
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:22,400
it's still completely replaced

89
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:24,879
all reality sort of thing so

90
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,959
it's kind of unlike how you can see it

91
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:30,000
everything is replaced

92
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,400
um so what is what do you know what do

93
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,159
you

94
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,599
get when you add a or and b are together

95
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:36,000
or you know how can you

96
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:37,920
talk about it and that's sort of where

97
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,560
xor come in is

98
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:42,238
everything that's in there and it's not

99
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:45,519
you know extended realities

100
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:48,560
you know x is replaced for other

101
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:48,560
augmented or vr

102
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,760
so i'm going to talk a little bit about

103
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,439
open xr

104
00:03:53,760 --> 00:04:00,640
um like how do we do xr

105
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:02,159
uh kind of this very simplified stack

106
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,559
you have your program you have some sort

107
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:05,359
of

108
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,080
platform that runs that program runs on

109
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,200
um

110
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,120
and you know you have hardware

111
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,879
underneath the platform sort of extracts

112
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,519
it

113
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:14,079
and to have you know a program to talk

114
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:17,358
to the

115
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,919
platform you need an api and you know in

116
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:20,399
the past

117
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:21,198
and sort of how history has repeated

118
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:24,239
itself

119
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:25,840
and there's various different apis

120
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,240
kind of like the picture to the left

121
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,679
here where everybody has their own thing

122
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,880
and everybody if they want to support

123
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,400
everything you know they have to write

124
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,400
multiple apis

125
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,159
you know it's not a good situation but

126
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,320
where operax comes in is that they're

127
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,960
just a royalty-free

128
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,680
collaborative api that everybody can

129
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,000
implement

130
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,600
and you know you only have to run write

131
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,080
code once

132
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:51,600
yeah and then you can support wide

133
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,599
variety of platforms and hardware

134
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,960
so what's so cool about open xr it's

135
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,440
kind of just like opengl vulcan you know

136
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,638
it's

137
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:04,000
made by chronos it's uh open

138
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:04,960
in that sense um and as i said everybody

139
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,600
can implement it

140
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:09,520
it's actually out now uh it's action

141
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,840
based and i'll go a little bit into that

142
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,799
and there is no no open source

143
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:16,960
implementation for

144
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,960
for it um please us

145
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:24,400
um so one thing that

146
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:26,000
is kind of hard when you have you're

147
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:29,599
targeting different

148
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,039
platforms or you uh you know every

149
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,960
controller looks a bit different

150
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:34,960
i can remember like gamecube controller

151
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:37,359
or xbox controller or

152
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:39,280
those look a bit different so instead of

153
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:42,880
the programmer going i have

154
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:45,119
an xbox controller and i you know just

155
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,960
just get the inputs like xbox them are

156
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:50,000
pressed they instead

157
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:53,359
um give context to the program so you

158
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:56,479
say i have an action and that is

159
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:59,520
teleport um and then they say

160
00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:01,280
uh you might want to bind that to

161
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,639
trigger button on this type of

162
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,359
controller and you might want to bring

163
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:07,280
it to

164
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:09,039
a button on this type of controller and

165
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:11,039
so that but the runtime is ultimately

166
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:12,560
decides what actually goes into that

167
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:14,159
and the runtime i have done has a lot

168
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:17,440
more context

169
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:19,840
to understand what the

170
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:22,160
application is doing and also they can

171
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:24,400
show that to the user

172
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,199
uh either before or during runtime where

173
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:28,159
you can

174
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:29,120
more easily remap so you can see like

175
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,840
shoot arrow

176
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,160
or shoot canon button or action and you

177
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,560
can

178
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,280
map that to a button say you have you

179
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,280
know

180
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,638
you have a twitchy finger or something

181
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,359
and you want to just move it to another

182
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:41,039
button

183
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,960
or your controller doesn't or the

184
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:45,120
controller you have doesn't actually

185
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:47,198
match what the developers are running on

186
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:50,720
it so the default mapping might not be

187
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:53,759
the best for you so

188
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:55,759
i think the that's like the best second

189
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:58,240
best thing of open xr

190
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:58,960
either the first being it's open and the

191
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,479
second is just

192
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:05,680
that is action based and it abstracts

193
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:06,000
inputs in a completely new way uh that

194
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:09,120
is

195
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,199
i think it's you know a big step up from

196
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,039
just getting the buttons and then the

197
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:17,840
control and the game have to do all the

198
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:17,840
mapping yourself

199
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:23,120
so a little bit talk a little bit about

200
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,759
monado

201
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:27,199
again how do we exor uh you know you

202
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:29,520
have your program your platform and your

203
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:32,639
hardware

204
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:33,280
monaro is the platform um i sort of have

205
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:36,319
to go

206
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:39,840
expand up on this a little bit uh

207
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:43,599
this is kind of a highest level

208
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:46,638
diagram of uh what monarch is

209
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:48,560
all of the purple bits are monado we

210
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:50,000
have our own capacitor so

211
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,080
not to be confused by availing

212
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,440
compositor or

213
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:56,479
or a you know x filter it's a compositor

214
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,560
that

215
00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:00,000
takes what the game has rendered and

216
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,199
turns them into something that looks

217
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,960
good on the screen because

218
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:05,280
you often have a whole bunch of lenses

219
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:08,638
you can have even kind of mirrors

220
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:09,840
for ar devices and it's just dealing

221
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:12,160
with

222
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:13,198
taking care of all of the nitty-gritty

223
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:16,560
bits of

224
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:18,319
basically advanced optics and physics

225
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:21,840
of how to turn photons into something

226
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:24,479
that looks good in the eye

227
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:25,440
and you have couple drivers and you sort

228
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:27,680
of have this

229
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:29,280
platform corn on the side and on top of

230
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,000
it you have the open access tech tracker

231
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,559
which

232
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,719
if you're familiar to mesa and gallium

233
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:37,039
how that is built up is basically

234
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:38,560
built around the same principle but now

235
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:39,760
we also have the compositor and the

236
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:42,399
platform sort of

237
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:45,760
in that package so it's not just drivers

238
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:49,760
so it's probably very familiar to

239
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:52,319
mesa developers and the graphics people

240
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:53,760
but it's you know it's a slightly more

241
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:57,279
complex thing

242
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:58,800
and yeah you have part of

243
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:00,320
monaro there's a whole bunch of

244
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,560
excellent libraries and

245
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,680
those are you know we try to extract

246
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:07,599
things from drivers

247
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:08,800
so driver is mostly about betweenlings

248
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,640
that the things that come from the

249
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,680
hardware and then just taking components

250
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:14,720
and building

251
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:16,959
up a you know functional system

252
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,160
the compositor is quite large there's

253
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:21,279
you know wrapper around it

254
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:24,240
and all those things um so

255
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:24,800
another one slightly more complex but

256
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,640
still

257
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:32,000
scale down as you get feel how it all

258
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:34,399
fits together uh you might notice the

259
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,240
a couple of things that says xrt

260
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:37,839
underscore and something that those are

261
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,560
sort of the interfaces i'm going to talk

262
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:41,839
a bit about

263
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:43,839
them later uh and something that

264
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:45,279
we have in the future is we're going to

265
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:48,399
put a ipc layer so we can

266
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:50,959
just have one you know

267
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:51,920
compositor or daemon or you know run all

268
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:54,239
of the drivers

269
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:55,680
uh in one process and then clients can

270
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,680
connect to them

271
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,719
and from after that then they keep

272
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:01,439
running and you can switch

273
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,959
you know switch games or switch things

274
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,160
that you run top edge so you can

275
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:06,000
prompt for instance if you've heard of

276
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,040
the actual desktop project you can run

277
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
that at the same time you're running

278
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,000
games and things like that

279
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,800
so i'm going to talk a little bit about

280
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:16,079
the whole all xrt

281
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:18,959
underscore things that you were seeing

282
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:19,920
in the grimes so basically those are

283
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:22,800
interfaces

284
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:24,240
that kind of similar to the gallium

285
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:27,359
interfaces

286
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:30,640
uh it's

287
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:32,560
pure c so all nice and that it's not

288
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,519
stable so it's all internal interference

289
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,119
just like

290
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:36,480
the internal interface of the kernel and

291
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,200
turning into faces of the gallium

292
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:41,360
drivers

293
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:42,480
um so the basic thing we start with is

294
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,760
the xrt device

295
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:48,959
uh so it's for both uh

296
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:52,560
hmds and controllers

297
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:54,959
uh it has

298
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,839
sort of an aspect pattern if you've ever

299
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:57,920
heard that

300
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:59,519
where instead of having a inheritance

301
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,760
structures we have

302
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:03,760
side side struct that you kind of

303
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:07,600
allocate and point to

304
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:11,200
so a device now design this

305
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:12,399
interface i figured that some devices

306
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,480
might actually have cameras

307
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:16,399
and some might not and some might have

308
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,640
an you know how do you deal with

309
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:19,760
i have a control with the camera uh or i

310
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,800
have a controller that does not have a

311
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,240
camera and i can

312
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,719
you know the inherited structure does

313
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:26,560
become you know

314
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:29,680
that pattern isn't good so is that we

315
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:33,680
have this aspect that you add to it

316
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:35,599
uh and yeah um there's functions on

317
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:37,439
you know getting input setting output

318
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,720
like making it vibrate

319
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,800
and then there's a whole bunch of

320
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:44,399
information there on like

321
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:47,760
how the compositor should dry the pixels

322
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:49,920
to the screen that's on the device

323
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:51,120
and then there's a compositor this on

324
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,599
the other hand has

325
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,560
base class and then specialization on

326
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,920
top of it

327
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:58,800
there's some glue code for being able to

328
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:01,599
support both

329
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:02,399
gl and vulkan interfaces uh then there's

330
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,240
this

331
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:05,760
real compositor and they talk between

332
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:08,959
each other with fds

333
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:12,079
dma buffs uh yeah and then

334
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:13,839
this all basically uh

335
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:16,319
is just a mirroring of the open xo

336
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:18,399
interface uh functions

337
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,760
uh that you can look up in the registry

338
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:24,560
and see the

339
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:25,760
sort of how the map up then we have the

340
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,920
prober which is

341
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,959
sort of uh here's everything that goes

342
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:31,040
that's not

343
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:32,800
anything else but we need to glue

344
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:36,079
together or we need to

345
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:38,880
you know how do we find devices um

346
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:39,439
how you know take care of platform code

347
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,920
and

348
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,880
sort of a glue vince's and everything is

349
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:46,719
just

350
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:49,680
and policy holder uh please

351
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,680
stick it all together

352
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:56,160
so where are we uh we are mostly

353
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:57,920
complete with open xr and we have

354
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:00,639
currently only an in-process

355
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:01,680
composer we're hoping to do that soon so

356
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:03,040
we can get

357
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:05,120
around multiple programs at the same

358
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:06,160
time we have sort of built up a video

359
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,880
processing framework

360
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:10,719
and i will kind of show it that later on

361
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:14,639
uh we can track

362
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:17,680
uh these ps move controllers

363
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:19,600
um and

364
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,719
we're working on improving that as well

365
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,560
we have a really nifty

366
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,320
debug ui as well and i will show that

367
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:28,479
off

368
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:31,040
we support multiple hardwares natively

369
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:34,000
and we also have the north austin dream

370
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:35,040
daydream controller we have on our

371
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
branches

372
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:40,000
but we also have the ao3 sdk drivers of

373
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,399
by pro and index

374
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,920
we have an experimental branch for

375
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:46,079
positional tracking of those

376
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:47,439
through the live survive project which

377
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:50,479
opens the playstation

378
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:53,920
vr and move the razer hydras and we also

379
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:57,360
have a wrap around open hd so we can

380
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:58,880
use all those drivers that are there

381
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,720
sort of to make sure that nothing gets

382
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:03,760
left behind

383
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:06,800
and in terms of code uh i

384
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:08,160
thought it was a little bit fun so 35 k

385
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:11,519
of lines of code

386
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:15,040
uh you can see one driver is between

387
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:18,000
500 lines or 1500 so it's

388
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:19,199
we have extracted i think a lot of what

389
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,720
goes into driver

390
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:24,560
out of it and you can see sort of uh

391
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:26,959
all of the things all of the heavy stuff

392
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:29,040
is outside of the driver so it's

393
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:30,719
writing and driver is not really hard

394
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:33,120
once you understand the bits so it's

395
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,839
all the reverse engineering uh and then

396
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,680
your

397
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:37,360
the other hard parts are tracking and

398
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:39,040
mouth that goes around it

399
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,560
so that but those are in sort of a

400
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:45,360
helper libraries that

401
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:48,800
this is what monado actually gives you

402
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:52,079
uh we are hoping or planning on

403
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:53,680
uh sort of the short term roadmap

404
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:55,519
is finishing up open excel support

405
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:59,279
before the conformant

406
00:14:55,519 --> 00:15:00,800
improve the tracking add psvr tracking

407
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:02,639
and they got a process composite

408
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,240
capacitor um but that's kind of

409
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:05,920
just what we want to do but if anybody

410
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:09,199
wants to do anything else you know

411
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:09,760
they can do it on their own and also we

412
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:12,160
haven't

413
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:13,120
uh how to call it cold dibs on any of

414
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,880
your things

415
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,240
so if you you know think oh i really

416
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:18,800
wanted to do that you just

417
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:19,519
talk to us and we can help you out so

418
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:23,519
yeah

419
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:27,519
yeah it's just kind of our own plans

420
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:30,480
uh even further out um like how do we do

421
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:32,160
all the things that sort of steam if you

422
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:34,000
have ever tried steamvr

423
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,680
that you have their own system ui set of

424
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,079
ui the

425
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:39,279
you know sort of safe space that you

426
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:42,399
come back to if the

427
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:44,160
game crashes uh incorporating lighthouse

428
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:45,360
tracking and also looking into ar and

429
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,680
slam

430
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,680
tracking

431
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:56,160
so a couple of demos and pray to the

432
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:58,959
demogods

433
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,959
first and foremost

434
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,279
so i will start off by showing just

435
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,920
basic tracking

436
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:06,720
uh the coupon i won't tell this to you

437
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:10,000
guys so i don't

438
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:12,240
accidentally film you so this is

439
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,040
just basically two webcams a stereo

440
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:16,880
webcam

441
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:19,279
uh best tracking sort of available for

442
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:37,839
everybody

443
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:37,839
i will how to do

444
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:54,560
oh

445
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:54,560
um speak of the demogods

446
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:05,839
i don't know hey

447
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:14,639
so this is not actually showing uh

448
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:16,319
from inside it's really sort of running

449
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,720
in what they call headless

450
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:19,678
but it's more easier to understand so

451
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,919
you can see the both

452
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:23,039
two controllers here i move around them

453
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:24,959
uh we're

454
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:26,720
you know work in progress and all that

455
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:30,000
you can see it's a little bit jittery

456
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:32,880
uh but yeah you can see exactly

457
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:35,600
some of them are quite uh and i will

458
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:47,200
actually then show off

459
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:49,439
the debug ui for this

460
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,440
so

461
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:57,120
this is our cool nifty debug ui

462
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,120
and

463
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:04,480
i can sort of explain what's going on so

464
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,879
this is what the camera is seeing uh

465
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,760
it's

466
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:10,080
a very short exposure i can turn it off

467
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,080
to show

468
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:15,840
what is actually showing so

469
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:22,000
hey as you can see the exposure is very

470
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:25,360
short

471
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,240
but then the balls overexpose exposure

472
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:28,479
so actually

473
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,760
can't tell them apart now but if i love

474
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,360
it again

475
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:34,960
you can see there's one it's red and one

476
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:37,678
is purple and then i can also see

477
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:38,559
the filter so you can see this is the

478
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:41,440
red filter and

479
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:42,160
see there's a bit of a noise from that

480
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,559
one

481
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,559
a little bit

482
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:49,840
well i know why that is so that's

483
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,840
because the

484
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:57,840
uh the white balance is off

485
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,840
and now there's no

486
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:01,760
no noise on that so it's just picking up

487
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:05,439
this

488
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:10,000
thing and that's it's fed into

489
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:12,160
the trackers and they

490
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,520
show where the ball is in this drawing

491
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:16,559
and it's finding the ball

492
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:20,160
uh it's kind of a bit hard but yeah

493
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:23,200
so yeah uh that's sort of

494
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:24,080
where we are on that and also what i

495
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:27,360
have been doing

496
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:28,960
uh christoph had a nice talk where he

497
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,399
showed off the lip survives tracking in

498
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:34,720
his talk with um

499
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:34,720
about doing game develop kingdom

500
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:42,000
development

501
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:46,160
and yeah uh

502
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:48,400
that is it for demos

503
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,400
uh

504
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:55,679
a little bit of rants uh if i hot plug

505
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:57,360
non-desktop displays gnomeshell really

506
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:58,559
likes to reorder all my windows so

507
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,959
that's super annoying so if there are

508
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:01,840
any

509
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:02,400
developers please look into that uh

510
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:05,600
because

511
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:08,799
yeah i usually plug in and plug out

512
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:10,240
hmds uh and intel

513
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:12,639
gets a special callout because we're

514
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:15,440
using a extension

515
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:16,960
that's not available on intel uh to

516
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:21,840
interrupt between opengl

517
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:21,840
and our compositor and yeah that sucks

518
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:34,158
uh yeah there's lots of

519
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:35,760
lots of lots of work uh i actually had

520
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:39,039
the same status page

521
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:40,080
already in october and so are we

522
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:42,559
actually doing anything

523
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:44,080
and yes tracking is just really really

524
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:46,879
really hard to do

525
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:48,399
and we sort of just now actually have

526
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:50,640
some improvements on the

527
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:52,400
move tracking we couldn't get it in

528
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:54,080
right now and you know we have

529
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:56,720
made some progress on the ps3 attraction

530
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:59,840
it just takes a lot of time

531
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:01,120
uh and like how do we do settings i

532
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,959
think that do we

533
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:04,639
you know is growing interesting to make

534
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:06,080
their own dui do we have to make our

535
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:09,840
universe for it

536
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:11,840
um yeah and we're also like

537
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:13,039
really interested in building up a foss

538
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:15,918
exo

539
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:17,200
community not just for you know driver

540
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:19,200
developers but also

541
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,720
higher up in the stack but you know our

542
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:23,600
focus is there but we

543
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:25,200
have uh last year we had the first

544
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:27,039
fostexr conference

545
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,240
and we're planning to have one this year

546
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:30,720
as well so

547
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,760
the link there is to the false excel

548
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,440
twitter account we'll

549
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:35,200
tell you when we actually know when it

550
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:37,440
is probably be

551
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:39,600
probably be you know uh in amsterdam

552
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:42,559
around blenderconf

553
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:44,480
uh so a whole bunch of links i can once

554
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:47,200
i actually managed to get it up

555
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:48,080
we do actually have both internships for

556
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,360
extra stuff

557
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:51,678
so if you're interested in this and

558
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:52,959
you're finishing up your studies and

559
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:54,799
looking for internships definitely go

560
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:58,400
into the link and there's also

561
00:21:54,799 --> 00:22:00,158
regular job postings but if you're also

562
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,760
i don't think we have anything specific

563
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:03,919
for xr there but

564
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:05,520
i do think you should send you a new cv

565
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:08,559
anyways or just talk to me

566
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:09,918
if you're interested in it and

567
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:12,080
yeah and there's also all the other

568
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:15,120
pages for monado and open xr and

569
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:16,320
someone going on and if you see me you

570
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:19,439
know come after talk

571
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:20,960
or ask questions because i apparently

572
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:23,200
blew through all the slides and i didn't

573
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,960
think it would go that fast

574
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,320
so yeah talk to me about just about

575
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:31,760
anything uh

576
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:33,760
we are my own little programming amigas

577
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:36,879
voxels yeah just everything and

578
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:40,640
especially about johnny clabra

579
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:42,970
so thank you very much and any questions

580
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:50,940
because we have lots of time

581
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:50,940
[Applause]

582
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:55,840
yes

583
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,559
you mean

584
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:07,120
uh circles actually do yes they have

585
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:09,520
shipped

586
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:10,879
okay sorry uh when do we see more wonder

587
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:13,120
support for openxr

588
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:14,480
uh microsoft has was one of their first

589
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:18,479
one that shipped out

590
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:20,080
uh support there so they are there

591
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:23,280
oculus has also shipped up support on

592
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:26,879
their desktop i think yes

593
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:29,840
and and there's also us but uh

594
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:31,600
yeah more of them are coming uh steam

595
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:33,360
valve has their valve time so

596
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:35,360
i can't really comment on them when they

597
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:36,158
want to do it but hopefully at some

598
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:38,399
point

599
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:39,280
uh so i'm and they are in the working

600
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:42,480
group

601
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:45,520
so definitely are interested in it um

602
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:48,000
so yeah but it's still slightly early

603
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:49,120
but there's definitely a shift and i

604
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:54,000
think all of the

605
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:57,039
main players are on board so yeah

606
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:59,440
soon tm or valvetime soon

607
00:23:57,039 --> 00:24:02,400
but they're already all out there and

608
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:02,400
people can use it

609
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:18,400
yes could you please elaborate on the

610
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:21,520
fragmentation layout okay sure

611
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:23,360
okay so in the past uh

612
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:24,879
yes oh sorry so can you comment on the

613
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:28,080
defragmentations

614
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,960
uh sure um so in the post everybody had

615
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:31,360
their own api

616
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:32,960
oculus had their own api steamvr had

617
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:35,199
openvr

618
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:36,720
you know samsung and daydream and you

619
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:38,480
know they and we've

620
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:40,480
even open source community had their own

621
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:43,600
api with an openhmd

622
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:45,760
uh and you know most applications

623
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,879
brought it either to just openvr and

624
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:49,600
maybe oculus

625
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:50,080
uh or you know there was some windows

626
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:53,199
stuff

627
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:55,840
there but and you know we have all the

628
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,799
android applications so it's yeah you

629
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:59,678
couldn't really

630
00:24:56,799 --> 00:25:00,000
especially for us in open source you

631
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:03,360
know

632
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,960
nobody wrote to uh openationdl you know

633
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:06,719
you know unless it was a crazy open

634
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:09,840
source guy so

635
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:13,120
it wasn't really an ideal picture um

636
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:14,399
so what openxr gives us is that uh

637
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:16,320
there's one api

638
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:18,000
and you can make portable application

639
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:19,600
and the api

640
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,240
i would say is slightly more complex

641
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:26,799
than say openvr

642
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:29,919
but openxr also handles a lot more

643
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:30,799
types of devices and software is future

644
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:34,320
proof

645
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:37,200
but you know it's it's current

646
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:38,960
so target is just vr but it's definitely

647
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:42,640
designed with ar and

648
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:45,360
all of the knowledge that say windows

649
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:46,320
doing on hololens doing ar stuff

650
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:49,678
actually no

651
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:51,840
so it it's you know ready for it and

652
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:53,840
as time goes on we will release

653
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:54,879
extension and then update the core just

654
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:58,399
like

655
00:25:54,880 --> 00:26:01,679
opengl does where you know we had one

656
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:03,039
you know the first one um which didn't

657
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:04,960
even have textures and then you have

658
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:07,679
version two which had shaders and then

659
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:08,400
more changes you know built up so just

660
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:12,000
like that

661
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:15,279
open xo will be built up what's going on

662
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:18,159
as we go along yes

663
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:19,840
do you have any knowledge for something

664
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:21,440
that you can talk about about the device

665
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:25,840
plugin

666
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:29,760
it's not there yet uh there's probably

667
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:29,760
uh we have a face to face

668
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:33,520
next week and there'll probably be

669
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:35,840
discussion about it but it's

670
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:37,600
designed by committee uh for all you

671
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:38,399
know takes a long time and everybody has

672
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:41,918
to agree

673
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:45,279
but it also you know work through

674
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:47,120
things slowly so yeah

675
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:48,559
there's definitely a will for it and

676
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:51,039
it'll probably at some point

677
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:52,320
show up uh hopefully but in the meantime

678
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:54,000
you can write you know

679
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:56,879
one auto drivers and you will support

680
00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:02,000
open xr that way so

681
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:02,000
yeah next question

682
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,520
yes say you have a device that is not

683
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:09,120
powered by

684
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:11,840
html or something but expects the stream

685
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:13,039
stream to be sent to it yes about

686
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:15,360
devices that not

687
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:17,279
doesn't plug into a displayport or hmi

688
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:20,639
or anything like that

689
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:23,440
sure you know not always plug

690
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:24,799
modular so we definitely thought about

691
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,600
you know replacing the compositor

692
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:27,520
instead

693
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:29,039
sending it to say encoder and you're

694
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:33,120
signing it over the

695
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:35,440
uh wi-fi or 5g or say a usb link

696
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:36,799
which is basically what oculus link is

697
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:38,640
so there's definitely

698
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:40,320
you know if we had infinite amount of

699
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:41,120
time an infinite amount of code monkeys

700
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,960
we would do it

701
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:44,239
because it's fun and you know it's a

702
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:46,880
cool feature to have

703
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:48,480
but you know priorities and just getting

704
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:50,559
over the initial hump of

705
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:52,320
what you want to do so it's it's just

706
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:54,320
it's just it's open

707
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:55,760
you know and everybody can hack on it so

708
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:57,840
if you think that's fun

709
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:59,679
uh international please you know come

710
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:00,080
and talk and hack on it and then you can

711
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:01,840
have

712
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:03,600
we everybody can have it that's about

713
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:06,959
the power of open source

714
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:09,600
um yeah

715
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,600
next question

716
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:18,799
all right uh oh actually one

717
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:31,840
sure that's okay

718
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:44,960
yeah openexa was started by

719
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:47,039
i think valve epic unity oculus

720
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:49,120
so they were on there from the beginning

721
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:50,799
uh microsoft joined

722
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:53,039
uh after a while and i was sort of like

723
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:54,639
yeah we all cheered

724
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:56,960
because we didn't really think that but

725
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:58,559
they microsoft being the one that has

726
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:00,559
actually been pushing it most

727
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:02,320
i would say so they were there at the

728
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:06,080
start uh

729
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:06,080
and but yeah i think

730
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:10,080
if you do so everybody's fine with

731
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,840
opening

732
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:13,199
you know the front layer the thing that

733
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:15,120
application advice to because that's

734
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:18,480
actually solving a problem for them

735
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:19,918
uh where you know you know unreal

736
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:22,000
game developers right now i don't want

737
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:24,559
to target all of these

738
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,399
apis i guess one and then you know okay

739
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:28,799
we just have to solve the problems

740
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:29,520
everything that goes on behind is prob

741
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:32,000
you know

742
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:34,399
that's their ip and all of it lockdown

743
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:37,520
and stuff like that

744
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:40,239
but yeah

745
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:41,600
that's probably you know you know

746
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:44,159
contact protection as well

747
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:45,039
behind the scenes as well so but the

748
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:46,880
front

749
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:48,240
for part they're all you know they're

750
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:51,200
very open to

751
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:52,240
and you know they are releasing drive

752
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:55,120
you know run times

753
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:57,360
open xr runtimes that people can use so

754
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,360
yeah

755
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:02,799
yeah yeah yeah yeah but that's where

756
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:04,399
monado comes in so we you know

757
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:05,760
completely open source stack that you

758
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:08,479
don't have to

759
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:09,840
do anything like that and you know we do

760
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,640
have to then reverse something and

761
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:12,240
really

762
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:13,919
say hardware and figure out what

763
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:15,200
actually uh

764
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:17,679
you know what the bits do that we're

765
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:19,679
getting from the device and we have to

766
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:20,799
do all of the complex math to do the

767
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:23,840
tracking and

768
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:26,320
um you know slam tracking there's

769
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:28,799
tons of tons of university research and

770
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:32,158
you know spending a lot of time so

771
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:33,600
it's always a question of resources

772
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:35,760
that we have that we can do i mean we

773
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,000
want to do everything and our primary

774
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:38,480
goal

775
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,399
is to make sure that when the aor

776
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:41,919
revolution comes open source has a

777
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:45,439
solution

778
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:49,039
and also provide you a platform to do

779
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:49,039
also vr as well so

780
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:53,600
so yeah yeah and everything like

781
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,879
political questions i think that that's

782
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:59,918
fine just keep asking

783
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:59,919
anything even remotely tracks or that's

784
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:07,199
okay

785
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:14,468
okay i think that's it thank you very

786
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:14,469
[Applause]

787
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:21,039
much

788
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,039
you
