1
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:10,080
so this debate the topic is um

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:12,000
the four freedoms and the open source

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,160
definition are outdated and no longer

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,560
relevant in 2020.

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,440
our debaters are uh amanda brock neil

6
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,479
mcgovern

7
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:22,480
matt jarvis uh louis villa

8
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,000
and i don't think i've oh uh i'm sorry

9
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:30,080
andrew cash as i mentioned

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:34,239
um and i'm gonna give it over

11
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:34,239
so can you hear me now yeah yeah okay

12
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:39,680
so i am not debating currently i'm just

13
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,919
going to say a few words to you because

14
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,360
i

15
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:45,520
caused this debate to be uh

16
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:47,039
suggested at foster dam when the debate

17
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:50,399
format came out

18
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:53,600
and i i requested this slot because

19
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,960
we had had a meeting last year under

20
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,440
chatham house rules

21
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,280
as lawyers and there were some really

22
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,879
vicious arguments going on

23
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,239
and obviously i can't attribute them to

24
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:03,039
anybody because it was chatting house

25
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:04,878
rules

26
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:06,640
but it seemed like we'd reached a point

27
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,080
where this discussion needed to be had

28
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,240
more broadly

29
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:13,119
and this group of people were willing to

30
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:15,199
come and talk about it i will say that i

31
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:17,920
asked a lot more people to come and talk

32
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,200
and most people didn't want to debate

33
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,400
i don't know if this is common across

34
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,680
the debates but particularly women

35
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,560
didn't want to debate

36
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:26,080
so we have five of us we did have six

37
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,759
earlier in the week we've had one drop

38
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,759
out so what we're going to do is

39
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:33,439
slightly different i guess we are going

40
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:35,759
to run through the panel order of 7733

41
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:36,880
but we are going to just flow a little

42
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,560
bit more be

43
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,240
somewhere between a traditional sort of

44
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:43,040
high school debate format

45
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:44,880
and a panel session and we really want

46
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,479
to get the audience debating with us

47
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,240
which was really why we put this

48
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:50,240
in the first place to discuss what's

49
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,679
going on so with that i'm going to hand

50
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:55,280
over to lewis who's the

51
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:57,360
first proposer so um

52
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,719
my disclaimer here i mean there is the

53
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,600
standard disclaimer

54
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:03,679
um i want to particularly stress that i

55
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,158
until recently was a card-carrying fsf

56
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,079
member

57
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:07,840
and and am a member of the open source

58
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:10,239
initiative was a member of the open

59
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:12,160
source initiative board so

60
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:13,120
please use that in context when i say

61
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,799
some things that are going to come

62
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,920
across pretty harsh

63
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,920
so um

64
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,359
five seven

65
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:26,080
20 i can go um

66
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,520
someone was impressed that i had all

67
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,520
these notes and i said that i can talk

68
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,080
about this for hours uh without notes

69
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,680
but

70
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,680
if i only have seven minutes then i

71
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,560
really need notes so

72
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,040
um the first thing to know about whether

73
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,519
or not

74
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,319
the four freedoms and and open source

75
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:42,480
definition

76
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:45,119
are still relevant today in 2020 is that

77
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:48,079
these documents are 20 years old

78
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,599
if these documents still made sense 20

79
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,360
years after they were written

80
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:53,599
in exactly the same way that they were

81
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,800
written without having a line changed of

82
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:57,280
them they would be some of those

83
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,159
prescient documents in human history so

84
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,159
it is i think

85
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:02,000
not a criticism of their authors to say

86
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:03,519
that they didn't fully understand where

87
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,599
the industry was going to be

88
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:07,519
right they didn't know that sas would

89
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:08,799
take they didn't even know what sas was

90
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:10,800
they didn't know that sas was going to

91
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,680
take over they didn't know about the

92
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,360
growth of data

93
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,720
privacy and ethical concerns though in

94
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,760
the case of the for freedom some of

95
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,359
those were

96
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,799
the outlines of some of those were

97
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,239
beginning to come into view but the

98
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,080
centrality of technology

99
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:23,680
all those questions uh would have been

100
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,040
difficult to see of course the

101
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,680
centrality of open source

102
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:30,239
and free software to the entire industry

103
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:32,720
that was a pipe dream that we all wanted

104
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,599
and we wrote these definitions in part

105
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,599
with

106
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:37,200
this sort of like well we will fight to

107
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:39,920
get there instead of

108
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,720
instead of with the reality of hey we've

109
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,238
won

110
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,159
open source software is one free

111
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:45,360
software pointedly i will point out has

112
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:49,359
not won

113
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:51,360
um and uh and of course we've gone from

114
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,040
fitting everyone in open source onto the

115
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,040
campus of one university

116
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,560
to literally there are more people doing

117
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,480
open source now than live in all of

118
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,680
brussels or probably all of belgium i

119
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,079
should have checked the population of

120
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,840
belgium

121
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:05,439
before i started this so

122
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,040
the next thing i want to say about why

123
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:09,760
these definitions are outdated

124
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:11,679
is where do you see communities anywhere

125
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:13,679
in these definitions

126
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,879
every time people talk about free

127
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,400
software and open source in the

128
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:18,000
healthiest positive sense

129
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:19,679
they talk about collaboration of

130
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,560
communities of connected people

131
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,560
the reason we are all here at fosdem is

132
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,240
because of the amazing

133
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,720
wonderful community that has formed

134
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,639
around this and yet if you look in these

135
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:33,360
things they are all about these dry

136
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:34,080
technical things about copyright law

137
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,720
they speak

138
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,520
nothing to what has actually been most

139
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,800
powerful

140
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,639
which is the communities that have

141
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,759
formed around them um

142
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:44,720
you know one important way to think

143
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:45,919
about gpl v2 which predates the osd and

144
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,520
the four freedoms

145
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:50,560
is that by enforcing a certain level of

146
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:52,719
sharing it makes a compromise on freedom

147
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,960
in order to help build community we

148
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,960
don't have we have lost that language we

149
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:59,680
don't know how to compromise on

150
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:01,520
data uh well actually i was going to say

151
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,680
on source code but

152
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,639
also in data right van lindberger's here

153
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,560
has been

154
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:08,160
trying to get a license through the open

155
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,960
uh through the open source initiative

156
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,680
process

157
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:13,520
where guess what software in 2020

158
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:16,080
without data

159
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:17,840
is junk it's useless and yet the open

160
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,560
source definition says nothing about

161
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,159
data

162
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,840
it says nothing about how we use this

163
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,759
stuff and so when we

164
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,679
have to fight through these outdated

165
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:29,199
definitions

166
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,199
oh man i'm making great time

167
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:37,759
i don't know a benefit a curse um

168
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:39,360
you know the another thing so i was

169
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:40,720
actually let me transition then into the

170
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,639
data thing

171
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,240
it is perfectly compliant with the four

172
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:45,759
freedoms and the open source definition

173
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,800
to distribute software

174
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:50,320
that won't build install or run

175
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,240
and it's limited to the software that

176
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:54,719
you have in your hands

177
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,160
right so if i got the software from you

178
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,919
then hey maybe we can put some

179
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,960
requirements into place

180
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:03,198
that uh require uh that i'm required to

181
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,960
have it but if it's on a server

182
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:06,319
the four freedom sort of speaks to that

183
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,400
the open source definition does not

184
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:12,479
speak to that at all

185
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:14,479
and uh so in the world of 2020 when so

186
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:16,000
much of our software isn't actually ever

187
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:17,280
in our hands

188
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,680
the four freedoms and open source

189
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:22,000
definition don't answer that question

190
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,680
and it's central to how we think about

191
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,120
things right and again

192
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:29,919
uh some of these licenses uh like agpl

193
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,880
like the crypto cryptographic autonomy

194
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:32,719
license

195
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:36,080
um which i'm always going to want to

196
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:38,560
call the kryptonomy license

197
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:41,198
those things aren't spoken to by the

198
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:44,400
four freedoms in the osd

199
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:47,440
and of course there's this question that

200
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:49,359
i sort of alluded to earlier

201
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:51,440
is this question of what we use software

202
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:54,479
for in other words what is the ethics

203
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:55,199
of the software we use now the four

204
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:57,520
freedoms

205
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:59,280
conceptually are grounded in ethics

206
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,840
right we believe in the four

207
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:04,159
freedoms because we believe that that

208
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:05,679
leads to a more ethical software

209
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:09,039
but the four freedoms aren't tests of

210
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:11,199
ethics the four freedoms are tests of

211
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:12,560
well can i can i change this software do

212
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:13,599
i have the right

213
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,919
it doesn't say anything about the

214
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:17,280
ability to change software doesn't say

215
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:20,159
anything about

216
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:22,318
uh you know are we everyone in this room

217
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,000
is in the one percent

218
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:25,919
of people in the world probably the

219
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,520
point one percent of people in the world

220
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:29,359
in the level of control that we have

221
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:32,719
over our software

222
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:35,120
right um our the for freedom says

223
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,759
nothing about that other 99.9 percent

224
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,080
now

225
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:40,080
the fsf to their to their great credit

226
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:41,359
does say other things about that

227
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,919
but it's not captured in the four

228
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,919
freedoms if the fsf the organization

229
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:47,440
went away tomorrow and we had to rebuild

230
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:49,758
from the four freedoms

231
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:51,520
it would tell us very little about all

232
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,720
this other important stuff things like

233
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:55,919
accessibility

234
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:58,800
things like privacy look in the four

235
00:07:55,919 --> 00:08:00,560
freedoms and you won't find those things

236
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,800
and of course that was obvious enough

237
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,560
that was already a problem in 2006 when

238
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,919
i started law school a classmate of mine

239
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,240
who now works for the

240
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:10,318
american civil liberties union asked me

241
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,960
why is software morally important

242
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:14,479
now those of you gone to law school know

243
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,758
that most people in law school are drunk

244
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:17,758
most of the time

245
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:19,039
um and so that's part of why i couldn't

246
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:22,160
answer her question

247
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:24,159
um but my answer was big and sprawling

248
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:26,879
and they were not convinced

249
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,440
right to talk to her now and to say why

250
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,280
is

251
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,800
software morally important is of course

252
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,559
an obvious question

253
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,000
right we all know from facebook

254
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:35,838
upsetting our elections

255
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,440
we know from the privacy implications of

256
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:39,200
all this stuff uh

257
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,279
that you know software at the end of the

258
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,320
day mediates essentially every human

259
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:44,320
transaction

260
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,080
and so who controls software and who can

261
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:49,200
use it has immense

262
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,640
impact on issues of justice and again

263
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:53,440
the open source definition says nothing

264
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:55,839
of justice this is nothing of morality

265
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,959
and the four freedoms only tangentially

266
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:58,720
does

267
00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:00,319
to put it another way when this was

268
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,440
about richard struggling with his

269
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,279
printer

270
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,560
saying no restrictions on my use was

271
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:06,399
good enough

272
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,160
when this is about exxon using free

273
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:09,600
software to extract carbon from the

274
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,120
ground more efficiently

275
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,120
or the department of defense using

276
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:16,080
linux-based cloud systems to bomb the

277
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:17,920
whole world more efficiently

278
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,000
don't we need to have some sense of

279
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:23,040
ethics in those definitions

280
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,959
right in a world that is

281
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,560
entirely driven by software we need to

282
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:28,880
be thinking about the bigger picture

283
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:31,439
because access and modification is

284
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:33,279
simply not enough

285
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:37,839
uh to quote bradley i yield the

286
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:37,839
remainder of my time

287
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,839
yeah okay

288
00:09:53,839 --> 00:10:00,000
so um obviously we don't agree with the

289
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:06,240
with lewis's um stand in the middle and

290
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:06,240
i've got my notes here um

291
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:11,279
so i think if we look back to the 1990s

292
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,120
when

293
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:14,880
these ideas were codified you know it's

294
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:17,040
important i think to

295
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,240
and useful to to step back and and

296
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:21,360
revisit some of these

297
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:23,200
why these things came into being so if

298
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:26,800
we look back to the 1990s

299
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:28,560
um mobile phones were pretty uncommon

300
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,240
mass adoption of the internet was pretty

301
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:32,399
nascent

302
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:34,079
many people didn't have home computers

303
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,959
uh the world wide web was just getting

304
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:38,399
going

305
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:39,920
and um as we fast forward 30 years

306
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:42,240
as lewis said software has become

307
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:44,399
completely pervasive in our lives

308
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,000
so the control over the software that

309
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:49,040
you use has become

310
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,680
um exponentially more important than it

311
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,880
was

312
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:53,359
uh then um for the vast majority of

313
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,079
people

314
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:57,839
in the first world at least um computing

315
00:10:56,079 --> 00:11:00,880
permeates everything we do at work

316
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:03,200
and in our leisure time and

317
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:05,040
really uh open source and free software

318
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:07,600
has enabled all of this

319
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:09,519
um linux and the surrounding utilities

320
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:12,800
from from gnu and elsewhere

321
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:14,079
now runs our planet um everything from

322
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:17,279
the tiniest embedded

323
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:18,800
uh device to the biggest supercomputers

324
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:20,399
android powers most of the world's

325
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:23,120
mobile devices uh

326
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:24,240
tor enables persecuted minorities and

327
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:27,760
whistleblowers

328
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:28,000
to communicate securely uh bind ntpd and

329
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,360
all

330
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,120
the other low-level networking

331
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,920
components power the internet

332
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:35,920
openstack and kubernetes uh enable

333
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:37,439
technology disruptions in every industry

334
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:40,959
from telcos to banking

335
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:42,959
openssl protects our online world

336
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:44,000
open ssh allows us to use computers

337
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:46,399
securely

338
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,360
the list goes on and on and you know

339
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:49,839
without free

340
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,399
and open source software we would likely

341
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:52,720
have had

342
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:54,560
none of the global cloud providers um

343
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,720
google amazon azure

344
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:58,160
and every other player in that space run

345
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,079
almost entirely on

346
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,519
open source software and without the

347
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:02,399
four freedoms and the open source

348
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:04,560
definition

349
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:05,839
our world uh could have been very

350
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:08,560
different for those of us

351
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:10,000
um who were around during that time it

352
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:12,479
was not at all obvious

353
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,360
that uh linux would take us to where we

354
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,639
are today

355
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,880
uh there were definitely points in the

356
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:18,160
90s and the early 2000s when

357
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:20,000
the open source and free software

358
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:22,319
movements could easily have lost

359
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,399
uh those battles um you know this was

360
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,839
the era of the ceo of microsoft saying

361
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:27,680
linux is a cancer

362
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:29,680
um the days of encryption and computing

363
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,839
power uh considered to be offensive

364
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,839
weapons that needed controlling

365
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:35,040
and the days of things like the sco

366
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:38,000
lawsuit against

367
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:39,120
ibm claiming ownership over linux so

368
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,600
there were definitely

369
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:44,480
armies rage arranged against us and

370
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:46,639
ultimately the power of community

371
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,880
which the four freedoms and the osd have

372
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:51,120
given us proved to be the best way of

373
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:52,800
producing high quality software

374
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,639
and that's ultimately proved to be the

375
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:57,040
tipping point

376
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:59,040
uh so whilst um those things are both

377
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:01,199
specific about source code

378
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:03,599
i i think that source code in a way

379
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:05,519
isn't necessarily the most important

380
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,200
aspect of that it's what goes along with

381
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:08,959
that access to source code

382
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:11,200
that's really had that power to change

383
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:13,599
the world um

384
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:15,120
creating community around software uh

385
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,959
communities in terms of developers and

386
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,639
communities in terms of users

387
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:20,479
is what has enabled the creation of

388
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:22,240
world changing software projects

389
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,519
like linux like kubernetes like

390
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,440
openstack

391
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:26,959
without community none of those projects

392
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,440
would have able would have been able to

393
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:29,839
achieve

394
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,360
the success that they have had and our

395
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:33,120
world would would likely be a very

396
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:35,040
different place

397
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,959
um you know as an example of that in the

398
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:39,680
in the 2000s microsoft were

399
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:40,399
uh giving uh customers access to source

400
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,160
code

401
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:44,000
but that doesn't actually provide to

402
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:45,680
users the things that are implied in the

403
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,600
four freedoms than the osd

404
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:50,160
that doesn't give them that ability to

405
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:51,760
change and integrate or the ability to

406
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:54,319
influence the development of that

407
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:56,560
software that can only happen

408
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,920
with open design open development

409
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:01,199
processes all of which

410
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:03,920
ultimately come back to community

411
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:04,319
i i think that uh that the ideas behind

412
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,240
the four

413
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,560
freedoms and and the osd have also

414
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,680
permeated across our culture in lots of

415
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,279
different ways

416
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:13,120
they're powerful concepts that have a

417
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:13,920
life of their own uh we can look at

418
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,399
publishing

419
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:17,360
you know around the creative commons uh

420
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:19,600
we can look at

421
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,800
examples in the legal field uh things

422
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,199
like drop law

423
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:24,240
um and um we can look at the open

424
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:26,160
hardware movement

425
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,279
uh where we're now applying the ideas of

426
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,959
open collaboration

427
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:30,639
and sharing to hardware design and

428
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:32,959
development

429
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:34,639
and so these ideas of openness have

430
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:36,479
really taken root in our culture you

431
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:37,360
know many very large companies now have

432
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:40,079
adopted

433
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:41,600
those open source principles internally

434
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:43,439
and externally

435
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,120
as the best way of developing complex

436
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:48,160
software

437
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:49,839
so in an era where our entire lives are

438
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:52,079
focused around platforms

439
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:53,519
where we store our photos our personal

440
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:54,959
data our emails

441
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:57,600
our interactions with our friends and

442
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:58,880
loved ones openness becomes increasingly

443
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,600
important

444
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,800
non-open platforms do put us at risk of

445
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,279
arbitrary changes

446
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:07,279
in terms and conditions uh often also

447
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:08,079
removing our ability to question those

448
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:09,600
decisions

449
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:11,760
our videos might get removed from

450
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,000
youtube our facebook posts get taken

451
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,399
down

452
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,120
our twitter account's frozen and it's

453
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:17,040
often

454
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:19,360
impossible to appeal against those kinds

455
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:20,800
of decisions uh we may have access to

456
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,480
remove because of where we live

457
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:24,319
uh because of our religious beliefs or

458
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:26,560
because of arbitrary political changes

459
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:28,240
that we have no control over

460
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:30,800
and we've also still got a healthy

461
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,639
ecosystem of corporate patent trolls

462
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,959
um attacking free software on a regular

463
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:36,800
basis so i'd argue that the four

464
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:37,680
freedoms and the open source definition

465
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:41,040
have become

466
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:43,599
more important in as concepts in the

467
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:45,519
time since they were first defined

468
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,360
whilst it is true that in a world

469
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:48,800
dominated by on-demand computing and

470
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,720
software as a service

471
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,839
it may have become harder to appreciate

472
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,519
their relevance

473
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:57,360
but the ideas and concepts that they

474
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:57,360
embody have never been more important

475
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:06,870
i see the 58 seconds

476
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:06,870
[Applause]

477
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:23,839
don't listen um

478
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:35,680
okay right looks like i have seven

479
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,079
minutes i've prepared for three so i

480
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:39,839
will

481
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:43,680
speak very very slowly um also

482
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:46,240
somewhat um confusingly um i

483
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,959
am also going to be i'm speaking in

484
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,040
support

485
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:50,160
of the four freedoms because of the fact

486
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:52,319
there was a change in running order

487
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:55,759
because one of the speakers dropped out

488
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:57,360
um if the

489
00:16:55,759 --> 00:17:00,240
um if the open source definition and

490
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:02,480
four freedoms are outdated

491
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,600
then why have they been used more

492
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,679
recently

493
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,280
by organizations such as the open source

494
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:09,439
hardware association

495
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:10,399
or the open hardware and design alliance

496
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:12,880
or the open

497
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,520
uh knowledge foundation in each case is

498
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,880
the benefit

499
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:19,520
of the basis for their own set of

500
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:21,600
equivalent freedoms and principles in

501
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:24,000
those particular fields of endeavor

502
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:24,879
so open hardware open source hardware

503
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,280
open data

504
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:29,200
have all adopted principles that are

505
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:31,039
very closely based on either the four

506
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:34,160
freedoms or the open source

507
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:36,240
definition and there's a reason for that

508
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:38,720
and the reason is that those principles

509
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:41,840
still hold and they still work

510
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:43,280
and my experience

511
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:45,280
my i've been involved in drafting the

512
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,678
cern open hardware license and as part

513
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,320
of that

514
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:50,000
experience i found that reference back

515
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:52,399
to both the four freedoms

516
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,440
and the open source definition proved to

517
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:56,240
be very useful

518
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,640
on numerous occasions particularly

519
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,960
because

520
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:00,320
during the drafting process people

521
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,960
continued

522
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:04,799
to say to us wouldn't it be great if the

523
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,240
cern open hardware license could do this

524
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:07,520
wouldn't it be great if it could do that

525
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:10,640
they wanted it

526
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:13,039
to for example ensure that any hardware

527
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:14,000
that was made and licensed under the

528
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:16,960
cern open hardware

529
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,000
license was um sustainably produced you

530
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,919
know great idea

531
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,360
that that's that that's very laudable

532
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:24,320
aim certainly

533
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:25,918
um they also wanted to make sure um that

534
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:27,439
any hardware that was produced was

535
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:29,440
fixable as well

536
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:31,120
so that would you know easily accessible

537
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,320
things like you know don't use security

538
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:35,280
fastenings

539
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:36,799
um don't don't glue things um unless you

540
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,240
absolutely have to make sure that you

541
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:40,639
can take things to pieces

542
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:42,320
you can substitute components most

543
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,600
easily you know again that's a great

544
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:45,520
idea

545
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:47,520
um and more generally various

546
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,960
suggestions trying to prevent the

547
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,960
hardware that was licensed under the

548
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:53,039
cern open hardware license

549
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:54,400
uh from from being used for evil

550
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:55,280
whatever that evil happened to be

551
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,160
whether it was

552
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:59,120
um evil that was you know used um as a

553
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:02,480
weapon or

554
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:05,840
um in um some some sort of

555
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:08,320
um non-environmental fashion

556
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:10,159
um so we we kept on getting inundated

557
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:13,918
you know with all of these very very

558
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:15,760
laudable ideas and

559
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:17,120
we felt very strongly that we needed to

560
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:19,440
reject those because we

561
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:21,039
would have ended up with a license that

562
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,720
was effectively useless

563
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:25,120
it would have had so it would be so

564
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:28,400
cumbersome to use it would restrict

565
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:30,000
the the use of the hardware so much

566
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,760
we were trying to anticipate a whole

567
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,000
bunch of things that really

568
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:35,520
it wasn't appropriate to put in what in

569
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,120
essence is an intellectual property

570
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,639
rights license

571
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:41,760
and the easiest way to counter that was

572
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:44,640
to go back to the original definitions

573
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:46,240
now there's absolutely no reason at all

574
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,600
why you shouldn't campaign for these

575
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:50,160
other things as well

576
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:52,000
in fact you know you yes go out there

577
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:53,039
and argue for um for environmental

578
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,200
sustainability

579
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:56,480
go out there and argue that hardware

580
00:19:55,200 --> 00:20:00,000
should be um

581
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:02,400
capable of of being easily uh repaired

582
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,280
and so on um but those are separate

583
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,840
issues

584
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:07,200
and if you want to look at things in the

585
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:09,120
software context like

586
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,480
um you know sustainable community

587
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:13,199
development and this sort of thing

588
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:14,320
then that's surely a place for a

589
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:17,520
separate set

590
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:19,360
of principles that go alongside the

591
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:21,520
fundamental principles

592
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:24,320
about software freedom and the open

593
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:24,320
source definition

594
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:35,840
sorry

595
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:41,439
lost my notes there for a second

596
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:48,559
yeah so yeah no no that that's fine

597
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,679
so um yes said i i've only prepared for

598
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:52,320
three minutes anyway

599
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:52,799
uh so my fundamental point is the open

600
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,360
source

601
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:56,080
uh definition and the four freedoms uh

602
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:58,799
they remain

603
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:59,678
um uh relevant and fundamental bedrock

604
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,039
of what we're doing

605
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:03,679
there are plenty of other things that

606
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:04,320
are also good beneficial and we should

607
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,000
consider

608
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:08,000
campaigning for those separately but

609
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:11,679
don't try to conflate them all

610
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,679
into a single set of principles thank

611
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,840
you

612
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,720
i'm brilliant for seven minutes

613
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,520
apparently excellent um i i've prepared

614
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,159
three minutes

615
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:37,918
worth of stuff as well and i thought no

616
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:40,159
it's fine i can feel that

617
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:42,000
i'll fill it it's okay um and i thought

618
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:44,960
i was going to be opposing it but

619
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,679
you just proposed it as well so i'll

620
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:48,240
just

621
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:49,120
kind of talk for seven minutes um

622
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:52,000
probably on

623
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:52,000
on both um

624
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:59,919
i i can start off speaking against

625
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,240
i don't know okay

626
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:13,760
so i recently came back from the china

627
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:16,880
open source convention and

628
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:19,039
tencent there had done a study and

629
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:21,520
tried to estimate how much of the

630
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:23,760
world's computing was now

631
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,799
of software running today was open

632
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:28,158
source and

633
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:31,120
they estimated over 95 percent

634
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:32,400
of all software running is open source

635
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:35,120
we've won

636
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,760
it's brilliant we've reached this utopia

637
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:38,479
where we

638
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:39,120
everyone is in control and why does it

639
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:42,720
not

640
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:43,678
feel like this there's something

641
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:46,240
slightly

642
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:46,240
odd here

643
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:51,200
for me

644
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:57,120
i'm going to say something slightly

645
00:22:54,640 --> 00:23:00,000
controversial which is i don't care

646
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:00,000
about free software

647
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:05,600
i care about user freedoms

648
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:10,480
the intention behind making free

649
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:13,280
software is important

650
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,840
but it's irrelevant if the reality is

651
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:17,200
that

652
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:19,678
users can't make use of those freedoms

653
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:21,280
lewis was quite near it's less than half

654
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:24,799
a percent of the world's population

655
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:27,200
can code the chance of

656
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:27,918
users being able to modify their own

657
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,919
hardware

658
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:31,760
or being rich enough to be able to

659
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:32,640
afford to find someone and contract

660
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:35,360
someone else

661
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:37,200
to modify that to that software is

662
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:40,240
vanishingly small

663
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:43,279
and it's our responsibility i feel to

664
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:46,720
provide for that user first

665
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:49,919
does it matter if a piece of code is

666
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:51,440
gpl or bsd licensed if your data is

667
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:54,720
being sent to a third party

668
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:57,279
to modify and monetized

669
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,880
does it matter if something happens to

670
00:23:57,279 --> 00:24:01,520
be under an mit license

671
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:02,960
if you can't access your computing

672
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:05,600
because you have a disability

673
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:07,039
or you can't afford a really fast

674
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:10,080
internet connection to get

675
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:11,919
all the latest all the latest

676
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:14,080
software or the metadata that comes with

677
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:14,080
it

678
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:19,840
that said

679
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:24,799
the question is that the four freedoms

680
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:28,959
and the osi is

681
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:32,320
outdated and no longer relevant

682
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:35,360
it is not what kind of world

683
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:35,360
are we trying to make

684
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,320
i put to you that we can't build that

685
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,720
world

686
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:44,639
without those four freedoms yes it is

687
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,679
lewis is absolutely right i completely

688
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,600
agree with him

689
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:49,679
openness is important community is

690
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,559
important control of data is absolutely

691
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:53,600
fundamental

692
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:54,320
i absolutely agree with him but we can't

693
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,559
get that

694
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:58,480
without those four freedoms they are the

695
00:24:56,559 --> 00:25:00,158
foundations on which we build this world

696
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:02,640
we want to live in

697
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:03,200
to say just get rid of them because it's

698
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,120
not doing

699
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:07,440
enough doesn't mean that that you should

700
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:09,678
get rid of them in the first place

701
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:10,720
and my question i guess to those who say

702
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:14,480
they are outdated

703
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:29,840
and no longer relevant is simple

704
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:29,840
which would you remove thank you

705
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:36,799
okay does that work so i i've sort of

706
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:40,240
drawn the short straw here

707
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:43,200
um i have to sum up both

708
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:44,799
both sides yeah yeah yeah yeah no no no

709
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,640
i know i know but i've drawn this

710
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:48,720
i'm going to explain why yeah yeah no no

711
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:51,760
no nobody's making me do anything

712
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:54,640
i'm here of my own volition um i have

713
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:57,039
the short straw because we are five not

714
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:59,200
six so we're not even so i sort of have

715
00:25:57,039 --> 00:26:00,960
a double sum up to do

716
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:02,880
based on both sides so i'm sort of going

717
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:04,640
to try if it's possible to make the case

718
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:07,520
for both sides and obviously i've just

719
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:09,039
written my notes now to do a sum up

720
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:11,600
so if we think about what the guys have

721
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:13,440
said it's very clear and run throughout

722
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,639
everybody's talk that we're sitting in a

723
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:16,480
stage of confusion

724
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:18,480
right everybody has said that there's a

725
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:20,960
lack of clarity a lack of transparency

726
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:22,720
and a confusion across

727
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:24,320
the half a percent did we agree on in

728
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:27,600
the end that's in this room

729
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:30,399
and beyond so how do we get to a stage

730
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:32,240
of confusion

731
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:34,720
i think that if we look back on the

732
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:36,240
history of both the four freedoms and

733
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:39,360
the osd

734
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:40,880
we see people choosing to work and to

735
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:42,799
give their personal time in those

736
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:45,440
environments because they believed and

737
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:47,360
because they wanted to do something

738
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:49,440
so they made that decision to go and

739
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:51,520
become developers working in those areas

740
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:54,000
as opposed to proprietary

741
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:55,760
and that was a really clear decision for

742
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,279
each and every one of them to make when

743
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:59,039
they made it

744
00:26:57,279 --> 00:27:00,799
now life has moved on and we've heard

745
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:02,879
people talk about being a victim of our

746
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:05,840
own success in some ways

747
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:07,760
and as it's moved on i think there might

748
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:09,678
have been a bit of a disconnect

749
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:11,039
so a lot of people in this room because

750
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:11,760
a lot of you are much much younger than

751
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:14,240
me

752
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:16,480
have grown up with open and free being

753
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:18,000
part of your day-to-day existence

754
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:19,520
and that's a good thing and that's a

755
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,000
commendable thing

756
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:24,879
but you haven't had to go through that

757
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,880
same choice process

758
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:28,399
and that same choice process you would

759
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,919
hope would have been given to you

760
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:31,678
and let you make an informed decision

761
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:34,080
about what and why you do it

762
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:35,840
but if it's just the norm you accept the

763
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:38,639
norm and you don't challenge it

764
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:40,320
and i'm told i'm the age i am so i

765
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:41,440
haven't grown up 20 years later but i'm

766
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:43,918
told

767
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:45,440
that it hasn't been clear to people so i

768
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:47,440
remember having an argument a year ago

769
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:49,279
with a developer i really respect

770
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:51,039
who kept telling me public source and

771
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:52,480
open source were the same thing

772
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:53,840
and they're not because you don't have a

773
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,960
license with public source and if you

774
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:56,799
don't have a license it's not open

775
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:58,640
source right it's very clear

776
00:27:56,799 --> 00:28:00,559
so i think we have what the boys have

777
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:02,399
talked about is a confusion

778
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:04,000
for no bad reason and we need to think

779
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:06,959
about what that confusion is where it's

780
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:09,039
come from why it's there

781
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:10,880
and to help us understand not just the

782
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:12,879
decisions the developers made to become

783
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:14,480
open and free developers we also have to

784
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:17,039
understand

785
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:18,960
what was meant by open and free so we've

786
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:20,640
got the osd we've got the four freedoms

787
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:22,320
but those were developed at a time when

788
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:24,799
we didn't have social media

789
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:26,158
so we don't see years and years of

790
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:28,158
twitter feeds we don't see

791
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:29,679
archives of many of the conversations

792
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:32,399
around some of those

793
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:33,360
i mean put your hand up if you believe

794
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:36,239
that the osi

795
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:36,240
developed the osd

796
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:42,960
where did the osd come from yeah i know

797
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,720
i'm just going to see

798
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:46,720
i'm not sure that i trust the the hands

799
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:48,159
up thing here so where did the osd come

800
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:51,520
from

801
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:52,320
right good so did bruce go up to a

802
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:55,440
mountain

803
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:55,840
and heave this bit of stone back down

804
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,760
with

805
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:59,199
10 things defined there that could not

806
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:02,080
be changed no he didn't

807
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:04,240
he didn't at all what he did was come up

808
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:06,559
with something that in the context and

809
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:08,080
in the time seemed to be reasonable

810
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:09,760
it's worked for 20 years so it's

811
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:11,279
certainly reasonable we've seen the

812
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,080
success that the boys have talked about

813
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:14,320
in open source

814
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:16,320
maybe we are a victim of our own success

815
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:17,840
but it has been successful

816
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:20,080
so we've got to give it credit we've got

817
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:21,840
to respect it and we should try and

818
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:23,199
understand where it came from and why

819
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:25,039
it's the way it is

820
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:26,480
so every one of those words there would

821
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:28,080
have been thought through

822
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:30,880
every one of those words there has

823
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:33,360
allowed us to get to a stage in history

824
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:34,799
where we can say we've won right where

825
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:36,559
we can have this massive conference

826
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:38,799
where lewis can stand up and

827
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:40,320
with hard facts to back them tell us

828
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:42,399
that the whole of the

829
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:43,678
the belgian country would not add up to

830
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:45,199
the number of open source developers we

831
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:49,039
have in the world

832
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:52,559
so we have one but why do we trust

833
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:54,640
something just so absolutely

834
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:56,799
now i like to challenge things as some

835
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:58,720
of you who know me know

836
00:29:56,799 --> 00:30:01,120
and i've wondered long and hard about

837
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:03,039
that why do we just trust it

838
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:04,158
well you have to have something to base

839
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:05,600
it on

840
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:07,520
right so they they always say i didn't

841
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:09,678
get a trademark does that really matter

842
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:12,080
do we care we know what open source is

843
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:15,120
because we have a definition

844
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:18,000
but i think that

845
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:18,639
anything that we follow if we look at

846
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,559
laws

847
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:21,679
if we look at maybe americans you find

848
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:22,799
this different with the constitution

849
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:24,399
that's written but

850
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:26,320
generally for most of us we're looking

851
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:28,320
at something there that changes and

852
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:29,760
evolves over time right we change we

853
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:31,600
mature we grow up

854
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:33,600
our technology has changed over the last

855
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:35,039
50 years over the last 10 years

856
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,639
it's not just the internet it's the fact

857
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:37,919
you have connectivity everywhere it's

858
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:39,919
not just that you

859
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:41,039
can access things online it's the fact

860
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:42,559
that you walk around with a phone in

861
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:45,520
your hand the whole time

862
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:46,559
so our world is unrecognizable from the

863
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:49,360
time that this was

864
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:50,000
this was written it has to be logical

865
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,600
and sensible

866
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,440
for us to challenge it right there'd be

867
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:55,439
something wrong with this group

868
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:57,279
this group of highly intelligent people

869
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:59,360
if you weren't constantly pushing back

870
00:30:57,279 --> 00:31:01,360
and challenging

871
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:02,879
but i think that for us to make that

872
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:04,879
challenge appropriately

873
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:06,960
we have to go back and understand what

874
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:08,880
happened why what every word means

875
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:10,399
why every word is there what are the

876
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:13,200
things that maybe we don't know about

877
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:15,439
that we need to understand in a context

878
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:17,360
how do the changes affect those words

879
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:18,559
how do the changes allow us to develop

880
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:23,279
into something

881
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:24,559
perhaps more of 2020 oh no

882
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:27,039
oh no because i've got so much more to

883
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:29,840
tell you right so i have to speed up

884
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:32,080
so we should be able to challenge we

885
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:34,959
should be able to look at this

886
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:35,360
we need to think more about what changes

887
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:47,840
mean

888
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:47,840
and how that's going to impact us

889
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:56,720
can i grab the mic and cross-examine

890
00:31:53,679 --> 00:32:01,840
some of you me

891
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:01,840
stand in there

892
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:06,399
[Music]

893
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:08,639
well i i want to cross-examine neil and

894
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:11,518
andrew if i may

895
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:11,519
but we can

896
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:29,440
sure sounds good i guess i'm the other

897
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:32,479
way huh

898
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:35,919
um so uh andrew

899
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:39,039
you said that um

900
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:39,440
you you said that uh oh yeah negative

901
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:43,919
time

902
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:46,559
sweets i'm going to go into the future

903
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:47,919
um you know andrew you said that these

904
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:49,678
issues of

905
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:51,120
well you know you mentioned for example

906
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:52,799
environmental issues that people wanted

907
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:55,600
to bake into the open hardware

908
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:56,000
uh and you said that these are separate

909
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:58,719
issues

910
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,559
but if my labor as somebody contributing

911
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:02,559
to an open project is being used to

912
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:05,039
literally bake the planet

913
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:07,120
how is this in it how it this seems to

914
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:08,559
me that it's inextricably the same can

915
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:10,239
you explain what you mean by saying that

916
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:11,600
they're separate

917
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:14,000
um i think the thought process is that

918
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:16,399
you need to go through uh to reach

919
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,039
a set of criteria that are essentially

920
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:19,760
about

921
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:21,679
um freedom to use something um and um

922
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:24,399
freedom to copy it and freedom to study

923
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:27,039
how it works and so on and so forth

924
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:28,639
are fundamentally different um from the

925
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:29,600
set of criteria that you need to apply

926
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:32,080
when you're looking at

927
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:33,519
wider social issues and as i say i have

928
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:34,240
absolutely no problem at all in fact i

929
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:35,760
think it's

930
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:37,679
you know it's highly laudable to come up

931
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:38,799
with a set of principles that deal with

932
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:41,200
these other issues

933
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:42,639
but i cannot see how it's possible to

934
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:44,399
try to get

935
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:45,840
essentially you know one document to do

936
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:46,399
the heavy lifting for all of these

937
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:49,360
things in

938
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:51,120
in one go but shouldn't i have some

939
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:52,000
ability to discriminate and say i would

940
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:54,559
prefer the planet

941
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:56,000
not be baked uh with the work that i

942
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:58,320
have done

943
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,360
um of course and uh but so you have a

944
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:01,120
separate set of

945
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:02,479
criteria so you can determine you can

946
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:06,879
say that um

947
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:09,359
uh you know my that the these particular

948
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:10,960
hardware whatever it is complies with

949
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:14,239
not only does it comply

950
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:17,199
uh with a set of open

951
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:18,879
source hardware criteria um it also

952
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:20,078
complies with a set of criteria that i

953
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:22,719
want to apply to

954
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:23,119
it that deal with environmental issues

955
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:25,359
so

956
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:26,399
if somebody then takes that then they

957
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:28,078
would have to comply

958
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:29,918
with both of those sets of criteria if

959
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:32,240
they want to continue to describe it

960
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:34,078
as being open source hardware and

961
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:36,239
environmentally sustainable hardware but

962
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:39,280
if they don't care because they're exxon

963
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:40,879
they're free to use it anyway well

964
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:42,879
that's dependent on the person who

965
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:44,319
um initially establishes the the the

966
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:45,598
hardware design it's up to their their

967
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,560
choice what restrictions that they're

968
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:47,679
they're they're going to they're going

969
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:49,279
to

970
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:51,359
there may be mutual incompatibilities

971
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:52,079
there um that's true that's something

972
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:55,440
that we have to

973
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:56,800
to work through but i think um

974
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,920
this is a debate that we had quite

975
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,560
extensively when we were talking about

976
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,880
the cerno

977
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:01,920
open hardware license um and we felt

978
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:03,920
that we just weren't um

979
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:06,240
equipped to be able to think about these

980
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:09,920
um these specific issues

981
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:12,160
um uh uh uh outside the scope

982
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:13,920
of the uh the essentially the sort of

983
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:15,279
licensed intellectual property freedoms

984
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:16,079
that we were trying to grant people to

985
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:19,599
enable them to

986
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:21,520
use the particular designs right um

987
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:23,040
i i have one other question that i want

988
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,920
to ask you but i'm going to switch to

989
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:27,119
neil

990
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:29,359
because we're halfway through so you

991
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:30,640
asked what would i remove from the open

992
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:32,560
source definition and

993
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:34,319
and i would prefer to think of that as

994
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:37,040
what would you add

995
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:38,560
uh because so for example you mentioned

996
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:40,640
accessibility and i know that something

997
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:44,799
that you and gnome care deeply about

998
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:46,960
um and happy there's nothing in the

999
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:48,480
for freedoms or open source definition

1000
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:51,520
about accessibility

1001
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:55,440
and um ios by

1002
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:58,560
every uh serious use by

1003
00:35:55,440 --> 00:36:00,480
people with accessibility concerns i

1004
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:02,160
believe that ios which is definitely not

1005
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:05,280
free is substantially

1006
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:07,680
more accessible than memo to name the

1007
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:10,079
last fully open source

1008
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:11,040
mobile operating system i used or early

1009
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:14,480
android which was

1010
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:16,880
more open source than current android

1011
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:18,880
should we be adding to the for freedoms

1012
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:21,200
or open source definition to be

1013
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:22,079
to take into consideration for example

1014
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:25,359
accessibility

1015
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:26,960
um i think it's incredibly important and

1016
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:28,640
i'm sure you agree that accessibility is

1017
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:30,000
considered and there is many things i

1018
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:32,879
think we all agree that

1019
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,400
we need to improve and we need to add i

1020
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:35,920
don't think the four freedoms in the

1021
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:38,960
open source definition

1022
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:42,400
is the place to do that

1023
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:45,119
i should also point out this big

1024
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:48,560
thing here when i say i believe this

1025
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:48,560
this i may or may not believe this

1026
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:54,560
however as an example of this i i'm not

1027
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:55,040
a lawyer so being cross-examined by a

1028
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:59,200
lawyer is

1029
00:36:55,040 --> 00:37:01,279
a little bit worrying um

1030
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:02,240
i was on the city council in cambridge

1031
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:04,560
and

1032
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:06,399
a motion was passed that we should only

1033
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:09,040
use free-range eggs everywhere

1034
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:10,720
it's brilliant fantastic and we can no

1035
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:13,279
longer give uh flu vaccines

1036
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:14,399
to the staff because that uses egg

1037
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:16,240
protein and there was no way to

1038
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:19,040
guarantee it

1039
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:20,560
do we want to mess about with with

1040
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:21,119
ensuring with messing these two things

1041
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,560
up

1042
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:24,640
i think there's unforeseen circumstances

1043
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:25,440
so if the city council had insisted that

1044
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:27,520
everything

1045
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:29,520
uh that all software used by the city

1046
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:31,839
council was free software

1047
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:37,839
uh and that meant that accessible staff

1048
00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:37,839
couldn't use it would that be okay

1049
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:46,019
[Applause]

1050
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:57,040
okay so uh so who wants to

1051
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:57,040
cross is that amanda or neil

1052
00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:01,759
amanda who wants to cross louis and does

1053
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,520
anyone want to join lewis i guess is it

1054
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:05,520
for the record i'm not the kind of

1055
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:08,640
lawyer who does cross-examinations

1056
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:10,560
so this is why so awesome which

1057
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:12,560
is a new thing to us because we don't

1058
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:14,240
normally do this in debate so

1059
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:15,920
that's why we're confused yeah okay and

1060
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:18,799
so uh when we get to

1061
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:19,359
uh to like 20 seconds before the end of

1062
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,960
the time

1063
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:22,640
so you hear some of us like snapping or

1064
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:23,760
rubbing our fingers if everybody joins

1065
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:25,118
us it's a lovely

1066
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,240
soft way to let people know that their

1067
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:27,520
deadline's coming and then we all

1068
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:32,000
applaud at the end

1069
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:34,720
and then they know they have to be done

1070
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:37,119
oh yeah sure neil's going to redeem

1071
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:37,118
himself

1072
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:41,839
so i've never cross-examined anyone in

1073
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:43,920
my life i'm not that kind of lawyer i

1074
00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:46,320
was a commercial lawyer not a litigator

1075
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:50,880
so i don't quite know how to do this

1076
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:52,720
um lewis you you talk about the sort of

1077
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:54,640
ethical stuff and putting requirements

1078
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:55,680
in there and apart from the fact that it

1079
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:57,040
doesn't work within the current

1080
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:59,359
definitions

1081
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:00,240
how would you ever make that work in

1082
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:03,598
real life

1083
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:06,879
so how do you enforce that and

1084
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:10,000
sort of how do you make those decisions

1085
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:10,800
well they're hard um i think the

1086
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,800
interesting

1087
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:14,480
question i think the interesting answer

1088
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:17,119
to that

1089
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:19,680
is to say that if you'd asked the same

1090
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:22,000
questions about copyleft

1091
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:24,240
before the gpl was written or indeed

1092
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:26,800
even after gpl v1

1093
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:27,279
the answer would have been i don't know

1094
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,640
right

1095
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:30,480
now but you're making the case for it so

1096
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:32,160
you have to know no i don't

1097
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:34,720
what i have to know is that if we

1098
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:36,160
experiment as we did in early open

1099
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:37,759
source licensing

1100
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:39,839
i have faith that most of those

1101
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:41,680
experiments will fail terribly

1102
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:43,759
um but that at least some of them may

1103
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:46,720
hit on workable answers

1104
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:47,520
uh and so the current open source

1105
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:50,078
definition

1106
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:51,440
as it stands rejects all experiments out

1107
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:55,440
of hand

1108
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:57,200
says uh if you uh you know if you

1109
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:58,720
experiment with ethical licensing in any

1110
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:01,839
way uh

1111
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:03,759
the uh the osi will wag its finger very

1112
00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:05,839
very vigorously at you

1113
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:06,800
and uh tell you that what you're doing

1114
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:09,119
is a bad thing

1115
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:10,160
right and i actually agree with the osi

1116
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:13,359
that 99

1117
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:14,480
of this is terrible ideas right but i

1118
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:17,680
don't want to be the one

1119
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:18,800
to say to that one percent you know i i

1120
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:20,560
try to put myself

1121
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:22,000
in the shoes of the people who criticize

1122
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:24,240
stallman early on

1123
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:27,040
right who said copy left will never work

1124
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:30,078
this is unenforceable this is communist

1125
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:32,319
um and if we had let those people

1126
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:34,160
determine the playing field

1127
00:40:32,319 --> 00:40:35,599
then none of this would have happened

1128
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:38,960
right instead we allowed some

1129
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:40,400
experimentation in licensing and

1130
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:41,920
you know most of the early open source

1131
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,960
licenses are not used most of them were

1132
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:44,720
failures

1133
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:46,640
but yet some of them did right some of

1134
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:49,040
them did succeed okay

1135
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:50,720
so give me an example of how you might

1136
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:53,599
see that work how you think that could

1137
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:56,160
possibly work

1138
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:57,440
well i mean there's two different uh two

1139
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:58,720
different levels where this would work

1140
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:02,319
right one level is

1141
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:04,640
the open source initiative could say uh

1142
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:06,960
certain types of discrimination uh are

1143
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:07,759
allowed and in fact i would say that the

1144
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:09,440
open source

1145
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:11,440
initiative has already said that certain

1146
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:13,359
types of discrimination are allowed

1147
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:15,680
against certain types of business models

1148
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:16,560
like say putting proprietary kernels in

1149
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:18,399
your phone

1150
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:20,000
right like that is a business model that

1151
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:23,040
is explicitly disfavored

1152
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:26,319
by the osi because they allow the gpl

1153
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:27,680
right similarly they the osi

1154
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:31,599
discriminates against certain

1155
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:32,879
sas business models by allowing the agpl

1156
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:34,400
now we pretend that that's not

1157
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:35,760
discrimination against certain business

1158
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:38,079
models

1159
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:39,520
except when it comes up to oh well data

1160
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:41,520
is a business model so we can't

1161
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:42,960
discriminate against proprietary data

1162
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:44,720
well guess what we already discriminated

1163
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:46,640
against proprietary stuff

1164
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:48,240
so we do all the time so one thing would

1165
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:51,200
be to simply acknowledge

1166
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:53,118
that that discrimination is happening uh

1167
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:55,359
and allow for a little bit more of it

1168
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:56,800
on the how might it work on an ethical

1169
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:59,839
license side

1170
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:03,359
come to copy left conf on monday um

1171
00:41:59,839 --> 00:42:05,599
but uh you know i think the uh the trick

1172
00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:07,440
as uh all the lawyers know to writing

1173
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:08,240
something that actually works is often

1174
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:11,040
about

1175
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:12,560
how you manage ambiguity right so a lot

1176
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:15,359
of these early

1177
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:15,920
there's a a very well intentioned uh

1178
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:19,040
license

1179
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:20,720
called the atmosphere license i think

1180
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:22,800
that essentially said that any entity

1181
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:26,480
that had more than ten thousand dollars

1182
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:28,160
invested in uh carbon extracting

1183
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:30,640
businesses

1184
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:32,640
which is essentially every indus every

1185
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:34,160
business of any decent size

1186
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:36,319
right because of the nature of the stock

1187
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:39,759
market and how they invest their money

1188
00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:40,319
uh couldn't use uh couldn't use this

1189
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,839
software

1190
00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:43,599
right and that i would agree is

1191
00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:45,839
unworkable um

1192
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:47,280
but you could imagine there's a list of

1193
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:48,799
the top 100

1194
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:50,800
uh carbon investing businesses

1195
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:52,240
themselves right and you could simply

1196
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,800
say if you're on that list you can't use

1197
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:54,560
this

1198
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:56,319
right every other business can use it so

1199
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:57,440
but you say you believe in free and open

1200
00:42:56,319 --> 00:43:00,960
source software right

1201
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:03,119
yeah no yeah i mean for purposes of this

1202
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:04,240
of this debate maybe i mean for real

1203
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:07,040
life for the record

1204
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:08,799
display no it's no it's either you

1205
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:09,440
believe in it or you don't believe in it

1206
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:13,599
come on

1207
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:14,720
i i i am deeply concerned that open as

1208
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:16,640
we currently define it

1209
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:18,399
removes a lot of ethical constraints and

1210
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:19,359
doesn't solve actual ethical problems

1211
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:22,560
that we have right

1212
00:43:19,359 --> 00:43:24,480
it doesn't it doesn't make android more

1213
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:25,599
accessible than ios we pretend it's

1214
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:27,520
better but

1215
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:30,560
if you have any kind of visibility

1216
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:32,560
impairment for example it's not better

1217
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:35,520
you know and similarly if exxon is using

1218
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:37,359
it to extract carbon from the ground

1219
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:39,119
okay is there a danger that you might be

1220
00:43:37,359 --> 00:43:41,359
being really really naive

1221
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:43,440
and that if you sorry lewis this is not

1222
00:43:41,359 --> 00:43:46,319
personal i may or may not believe this

1223
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:48,000
of course of course but isn't there a

1224
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:48,800
danger that if you make this one

1225
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,720
exception

1226
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:51,920
potentially you open a flood gate for

1227
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:53,520
people who might be less well

1228
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:54,720
intentioned than you are in terms of

1229
00:43:53,520 --> 00:44:09,839
doing that

1230
00:43:54,720 --> 00:44:09,839
absolutely yeah

1231
00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:19,040
is there any one other with all due

1232
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:22,960
respect is there anyone other than the

1233
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:22,960
legal debris regulars yeah

1234
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:29,760
and people who think that the motion is

1235
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:32,560
right will get preference so anybody who

1236
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:36,319
wants to say the motion is right

1237
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:39,599
again that the oh it's gone uh

1238
00:44:36,319 --> 00:44:42,400
that the osd and four freedoms are

1239
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:43,839
outdated remember for video please

1240
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:46,560
always speak into the mind

1241
00:44:43,839 --> 00:44:48,078
thank you lewis um the motion was that

1242
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:49,759
the four freedoms and osd are out of

1243
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:53,040
date and not fit for purpose in 2020

1244
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:55,119
no longer no longer relevant in 2020.

1245
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:56,800
and someone who believes in that to ask

1246
00:44:55,119 --> 00:45:00,560
us a question

1247
00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:03,280
carla piana carla

1248
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:04,240
i'll i'll ask question uh for what lewis

1249
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:06,240
just said

1250
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:07,919
uh so considering that the history of

1251
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:10,959
gpl includes uh

1252
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:13,760
sanctions against south africa and

1253
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:15,040
and sort of not and not putting south

1254
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:17,280
africa on a

1255
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:18,720
list in the license so that once they

1256
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:22,160
reformed

1257
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:25,200
then the there wouldn't be like like a

1258
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:26,960
license in legacy having an embargo

1259
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:30,640
against them anymore

1260
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:34,800
so if we put exxon on a list

1261
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:34,799
and exxon reformed how would that work

1262
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:39,040
i mean i i don't want to get into too

1263
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:40,960
much detail on this because i think it's

1264
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:44,720
a bit of a distraction from the bigger

1265
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:46,400
picture um but uh there are for example

1266
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:47,200
this particular case uh there are third

1267
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:49,359
parties who

1268
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:50,640
publish new such lists every year

1269
00:45:49,359 --> 00:45:52,480
specifically with the

1270
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:54,160
idea that they could be that they could

1271
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:55,119
reform right they might drop off that

1272
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:58,480
list

1273
00:45:55,119 --> 00:46:00,079
uh and so therefore you might not want

1274
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:03,359
universities to divest from them

1275
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:06,240
for example right and so if you say

1276
00:46:03,359 --> 00:46:07,839
look if you drop off the list great now

1277
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:09,118
that requires partnering with a third

1278
00:46:07,839 --> 00:46:10,480
party which

1279
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:11,680
historically i got to say is not

1280
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:13,440
something our communities have been

1281
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:16,399
terribly good at

1282
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:18,000
and i say that with lots of love um so

1283
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:20,160
you know it's not easy right

1284
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:22,319
i mean i think you know something that

1285
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:23,680
uh bradley told me some time ago that i

1286
00:46:22,319 --> 00:46:27,599
think is deeply right

1287
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:28,960
is that copy left was really a big

1288
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:32,800
conceptual leap

1289
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:34,240
and i want us to be open to the

1290
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:36,079
to the notion that there might be some

1291
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:38,000
big conceptual leaps just because we've

1292
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:40,800
seen in the past six months

1293
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:42,000
some well-intentioned but badly drafted

1294
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:43,520
licenses does not mean

1295
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:45,680
that there will never be a well-drafted

1296
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:47,359
license and the question is how we

1297
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:50,160
how we react to that or frankly how we

1298
00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:50,160
get left behind

1299
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:54,000
and i think that's really important both

1300
00:46:52,319 --> 00:46:55,680
in terms of the

1301
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,280
conversation about the osd and on a more

1302
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:59,118
broad basis

1303
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:01,280
we have to think about how do we deal

1304
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:02,640
with this right how are we going to look

1305
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:04,160
at changing it

1306
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:05,759
if we are going to change anything how

1307
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:08,560
could it possibly change and what's the

1308
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:11,280
impact of the past

1309
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:13,440
what does change look like that is done

1310
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:15,200
and measured

1311
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:16,480
uh what's changed look like this done in

1312
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:18,560
a measured thoughtful way

1313
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:19,839
is a really great question to ask that

1314
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:24,480
moves us beyond this

1315
00:47:19,839 --> 00:47:26,960
binary of the debate

1316
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:28,640
hi thank you for this debate um i've

1317
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:30,160
been in industry for a very very long

1318
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:31,839
time

1319
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:34,799
i don't know what the four freedoms are

1320
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:34,799
can we define them

1321
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:41,599
actually can i can i respond

1322
00:47:39,839 --> 00:47:42,960
so here's the thing you are in great

1323
00:47:41,599 --> 00:47:44,480
company um

1324
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:46,160
this is something i didn't have time to

1325
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:47,920
fit into my talk but i will take the

1326
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:51,118
opportunity to say it right now

1327
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:53,440
which is that one of the i was speaking

1328
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:54,720
recently to developer of lead developer

1329
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:56,400
one of the

1330
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:57,680
most widely used javascript frameworks

1331
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:59,280
in the world which is to say one of the

1332
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:00,558
most widely used pieces of software in

1333
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:03,040
the entire world

1334
00:48:00,559 --> 00:48:05,040
and he said i don't understand why you

1335
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:06,558
all are still discussing this

1336
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:08,400
we just think that open source means we

1337
00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:11,280
get to collaborate

1338
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:12,000
and we do it on we probably do it on

1339
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:14,400
github

1340
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,839
and as long as i can still collaborate

1341
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:17,920
these needles

1342
00:48:15,839 --> 00:48:19,119
on the how many angels on the head of a

1343
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:21,839
pin

1344
00:48:19,119 --> 00:48:22,319
uh are you know not super relevant to

1345
00:48:21,839 --> 00:48:26,000
him

1346
00:48:22,319 --> 00:48:28,400
right um and and i think that's a

1347
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:30,559
as we grow from 100 000 developers to

1348
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:31,839
100 million developers

1349
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:34,160
you know most of those people are not

1350
00:48:31,839 --> 00:48:35,599
going to know whether for you or

1351
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:37,440
how many people here know what the four

1352
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:40,480
freedoms are

1353
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:41,920
all right okay yeah how many of you

1354
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:44,720
would feel comfortable coming down here

1355
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:44,720
and reciting them

1356
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:50,000
because i admit i wouldn't actually neil

1357
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:50,720
just before you pass it to neil i'm

1358
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,640
going to say

1359
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:54,000
maybe we need something that isn't open

1360
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:55,920
or free to be defined

1361
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,359
maybe there's a need for these other

1362
00:48:55,920 --> 00:49:00,720
things that people are talking about

1363
00:48:57,359 --> 00:49:00,720
that they're doing to be described

1364
00:49:00,839 --> 00:49:04,400
somewhere

1365
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:07,598
yes i can repeat them because they've

1366
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:07,599
just been placed in front of me

1367
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:15,040
it is it is basically you can

1368
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:16,079
you get a program i'm not going to read

1369
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:18,480
off this because it's

1370
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:19,520
a boring way of doing it you get a

1371
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:22,720
program you can

1372
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:24,880
run it you can use it whatever you want

1373
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:26,319
and and that's actually the first one i

1374
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:27,839
think is is what's being talked about

1375
00:49:26,319 --> 00:49:29,839
here of part of the problem is

1376
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:32,000
for whatever you want what if i make a

1377
00:49:29,839 --> 00:49:35,440
program and i don't want you to do

1378
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:36,720
what you want to do but that's kind of

1379
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:39,520
tied into the

1380
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:40,799
fundamental freedom there of you can do

1381
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:42,720
whatever you want with it

1382
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:45,839
it's your software you're in control of

1383
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:48,160
your own computing

1384
00:49:45,839 --> 00:49:49,599
and i think if and that is so

1385
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:51,839
fundamentally tied

1386
00:49:49,599 --> 00:49:53,200
into this concept of these these four

1387
00:49:51,839 --> 00:49:53,920
freedoms i mean the other ones is things

1388
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:56,000
like

1389
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:57,760
you can modify it you can give it to

1390
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:00,640
your friends

1391
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:02,480
you can redistribute to the entire

1392
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:03,920
communities at the various and there's

1393
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:04,400
various tests which come along with that

1394
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:06,319
like

1395
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:07,599
desert island test chinese distant tests

1396
00:50:06,319 --> 00:50:10,319
and things like that but

1397
00:50:07,599 --> 00:50:11,520
the fundamental the first freedom the

1398
00:50:10,319 --> 00:50:13,759
zero freedom

1399
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:15,440
is that you can run it for any purpose

1400
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:18,960
now if the author is saying you can't

1401
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:22,640
use it for evil for example then

1402
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:25,040
what is evil and then how do you enforce

1403
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:27,359
that and or if i say you can't

1404
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:29,119
or we have a magic list what happens if

1405
00:50:27,359 --> 00:50:30,558
i produce a load of free software and

1406
00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:41,839
it's absolutely brilliant and then i get

1407
00:50:30,559 --> 00:50:41,839
on that list

1408
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:46,240
all right so thank you very much um so

1409
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:48,880
audience did you

1410
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:50,240
learn anything from this debate raise

1411
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:54,160
your hand

1412
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:58,000
excellent and the other question

1413
00:50:54,160 --> 00:51:09,839
is did you change your mind on anything

1414
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:09,839
as a result of this debate
