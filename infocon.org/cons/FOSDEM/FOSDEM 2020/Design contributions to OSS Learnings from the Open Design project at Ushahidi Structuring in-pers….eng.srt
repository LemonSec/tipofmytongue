1
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:17,520
okay

2
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:19,600
so thanks for coming to this talk

3
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,800
about design contributions to open

4
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,279
source software

5
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:25,599
uh the learnings from the open design

6
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:28,160
project which was a project that i did

7
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:29,759
during my time at ushahidi uh i won't be

8
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,679
going into any depth about what ishihidi

9
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,559
does uh just essentially it's an

10
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:37,040
open source non-profit humanitarian tech

11
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:40,320
company that i was the lead designer of

12
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:41,680
for two years so a little bit about me

13
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,200
before we launch into some of the

14
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,360
project background

15
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,440
my name is errol my pronouns are they

16
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,480
them if you're going to do any photos or

17
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,800
refer to me i'd

18
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,879
please use my pronouns i'm a

19
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,959
humanitarian designer

20
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:57,360
i've been in the design and user

21
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,879
experience space for about 10 years

22
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,559
previously in corporate and commercial

23
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:03,839
spaces

24
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:05,759
i have been though in the

25
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,439
community development and humanitarian

26
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,960
space for around about seven years in a

27
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:12,720
voluntary capacity

28
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:14,320
and two years in the open source space

29
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,360
so that's kind of my background and

30
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:17,360
going into this project

31
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:23,520
so as a person that was fairly new to

32
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,399
open source really i

33
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,880
came in as a designer with a set of

34
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:29,439
preconceptions

35
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,158
about how to approach the subject of

36
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:32,798
design

37
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:33,600
within any tool open source to me was

38
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,479
another

39
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,880
another way of creating a software tool

40
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:38,159
and

41
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,000
one of the things that became really

42
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,840
quickly apparent to me as a designer in

43
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,799
this space within open source after i

44
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,560
did some of the

45
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:46,880
very quick learning about what open

46
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:49,119
source is how the community is built

47
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,000
and how it operates in a in a very

48
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:52,240
different way to

49
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,520
potentially the corporate world or the

50
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,439
commercial world

51
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,439
is i was asking myself this question

52
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:59,119
when i was going through our repos

53
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:01,360
looking for contributions or looking at

54
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:03,600
contributions from coders

55
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:06,479
i was thinking why aren't there many

56
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:09,679
design related contributions to

57
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:12,560
our open source specifically but then

58
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:13,040
the wider question came up was i wonder

59
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,599
if

60
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,239
equally in other open source projects

61
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:18,879
are there

62
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:19,440
design contributions there so i started

63
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:22,560
to

64
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,680
have conversations with at the time we

65
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,360
had two designers

66
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,360
on staff at shahidi we were having lots

67
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,200
of conversations about how this could be

68
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,000
possible and what are the barriers

69
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,280
for designers to contribute to open

70
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,840
source software

71
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,040
we were designers employed working on

72
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,879
open source software

73
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:41,359
but we still have this desire in this

74
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:43,599
want to include the design community

75
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,519
in somewhat the similar way that the

76
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:46,319
development community is but perhaps in

77
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:49,440
a way that

78
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:53,518
works best for designers

79
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:56,000
so we engaged with a agency an agency

80
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:58,319
came to us actually ushihidi as a

81
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,560
humanitarian open source project

82
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:01,760
and wanted to do some some work with us

83
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,239
they were really keen to

84
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:06,239
explore what humanitarian open source

85
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:09,840
tech was

86
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:11,840
and with them we started talking about

87
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,640
this problem space of designers in open

88
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,959
source

89
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,159
and they were really interested it kind

90
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:17,440
of sounded to them

91
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:19,359
like sometimes the things that they

92
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:21,359
organize around like

93
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,519
called design jams or kind of designer

94
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,440
hackathons in a lot of ways

95
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:26,640
so you're like well how about we take

96
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,319
some of the time that we were going to

97
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,119
support you with and and create some

98
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:30,798
events and do

99
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,640
a design hackathon around your open

100
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:34,239
source and we thought great

101
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,559
let's let's see what happens let's see

102
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:37,760
what works so we did two different

103
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:42,959
events with this

104
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:45,040
organization and it's how we met adobe

105
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,720
through these different events we did

106
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:49,760
one in berlin and we did one

107
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:51,599
in seattle and these

108
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,840
are the basis of a lot of the learnings

109
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:55,280
about going into the open design project

110
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:59,840
that ushihidi

111
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:01,439
then got funding from adobe to carry out

112
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,319
and the key thing that we learned from

113
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:05,280
these first

114
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:06,958
events that were unfunded ones that we

115
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,599
wanted to explore and wanted to try and

116
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:09,840
find out

117
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:11,200
some answers to was that we essentially

118
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,319
found out that

119
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:16,238
designers by and large really want to

120
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:18,959
work on projects for good

121
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:20,238
that have a purpose that contribute back

122
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,960
in some way

123
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:23,440
to a community and it just so happened

124
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,799
that because

125
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:29,199
ushahidi was a humanitarian open source

126
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,919
the connection to for good was slightly

127
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,320
easier for

128
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:34,880
most designers to connect up with than

129
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:36,159
your other kinds of open source projects

130
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:40,400
so we found this was a really good

131
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:42,560
entryway into open source in general

132
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,239
so we formalized what we called the open

133
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:47,440
design project

134
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,960
um within ishahidi and this was like i

135
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:51,759
said a collaboration

136
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,479
between adobe as a funding partner

137
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:55,040
designer

138
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:58,000
as our interested agency design

139
00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:00,880
community partnership

140
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,160
part and then ushihidi as the owner of

141
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,520
the open source

142
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,280
tools the owner of the open source

143
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:08,799
projects that we were going to

144
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:10,320
pilot these different interventions

145
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,520
these different methodologies these

146
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:15,199
different things that we were going to

147
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,198
discover what we needed to create

148
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,039
so this project formerly started as a

149
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:25,120
funded project around

150
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:28,800
summer last year 2019.

151
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:30,880
and the first part of the project was

152
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,720
largely around discovering a lot of the

153
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,479
challenges

154
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:37,199
and well actually one of the first

155
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:38,960
things that we needed to do was define

156
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:40,880
what we wanted to try and achieve like

157
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:43,039
what did we want to do other than what

158
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:45,520
we'd previously done within the unfunded

159
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:47,360
events the the design jams

160
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:49,039
and we really wanted to encapsulate what

161
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,960
we had already done

162
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:52,159
but take it a few steps further and kind

163
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,080
of put it into this

164
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,520
this statement so we talk about

165
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:58,719
designers collaborating

166
00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:00,000
and contributing to humanitarian oss

167
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,240
at tech for good and challenge

168
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,400
gatherings this is how we presented it

169
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,600
to the design community

170
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,880
but like i was saying there were lots of

171
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,400
challenges and one of the first things

172
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,039
that we needed to discover before we

173
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,960
could

174
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:12,240
improve on the previous events that we

175
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:14,239
tried

176
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,600
was start to understand some of these

177
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,280
challenges

178
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,840
now each one of these challenges and

179
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:22,880
there are a lot

180
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:26,239
full many

181
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:28,719
many hours of conversation uh talks and

182
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,319
discussions long but i'm just gonna go

183
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,840
through them quickly

184
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:34,639
so that you have an understanding of the

185
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:36,638
things that we investigated

186
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:37,759
so one of the first things is that most

187
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:40,319
designers

188
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:41,840
outside of the existing open source

189
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:43,280
community

190
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,880
don't really have a clue what open

191
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:48,638
source is or can

192
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:51,199
be so if they have heard of open source

193
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:52,960
they might see it as the typical big

194
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,560
player as linux

195
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,159
they don't even know that there is kind

196
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,919
of such a thing as humanitarian or

197
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,080
non-profit or open source or

198
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:01,280
open source that contributes to good it

199
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,880
was something that was genuinely

200
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,239
surprising to a lot of the designers we

201
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,880
were engaging with

202
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,720
and most of these designers are ones

203
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:11,440
completely outside of the current

204
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:13,199
community that were coming in and

205
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,000
wanting to participate in something for

206
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:17,840
good

207
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,840
that was the draw

208
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:25,840
the next part kind of follows on

209
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:27,440
is the open source software and

210
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,198
all the things that are in encompassed

211
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:31,599
within that it's not

212
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:32,639
typically part of design education

213
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:34,800
although it's

214
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:36,639
slowly becoming part of some

215
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,840
institutions design education

216
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:41,199
very recently which is really

217
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:44,960
encouraging to see but by and large

218
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:46,319
my education uh and many of my peers

219
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,878
education did not include

220
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:50,240
open source as a topic if we used open

221
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:51,919
source they might have even

222
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:54,479
never mentioned that they were open

223
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:57,440
source or gone anywhere near

224
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:58,000
digging into the subject in depth and

225
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:01,039
this

226
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:04,160
follows on to another problem which is

227
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:06,080
around if you're not told and educated

228
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:09,599
and brought into this community

229
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:12,318
then how can the business world the

230
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:14,240
working world which most designers will

231
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:15,280
tend to go into the corporate commercial

232
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,400
world

233
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:19,840
how can they use open source knowledge

234
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,960
open source principles to

235
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:26,239
help them build their cv as well

236
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:29,120
if agencies and existing businesses

237
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,680
that are like outside of an open source

238
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:33,039
world

239
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:35,519
and not technology focused if they

240
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:36,640
see on a designer cv oh open source

241
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:38,399
what's that i mean

242
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:40,559
i'm not going to consider that as part

243
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,039
of like my hiring process it was like a

244
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:43,598
real

245
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:44,319
uh chicken egg scenario around like what

246
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:47,040
designers

247
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:49,440
saw that they could use as valuable

248
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:51,760
information for their further career

249
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,959
so they didn't feel like it was really

250
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:56,480
part of their

251
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:59,599
education so if designers know

252
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,800
open source then one of the things that

253
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,640
can be a huge barrier

254
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,079
is the existence of things like github

255
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:07,199
or gitlab and

256
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:10,240
even just the superficial interface

257
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:13,200
and how we use those

258
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:15,680
systems to host and build and

259
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,360
communicate our open source projects

260
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,599
most of the designers that i work with

261
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,600
on these projects as soon as you sort of

262
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,880
open up a github issue there's a sort of

263
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,680
apprehension

264
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:27,920
a kind of sharp intake of breath about

265
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,439
how to just get started with interacting

266
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:31,120
and you really often have to take them

267
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,160
through the process of commenting on a

268
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,160
github issue

269
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:36,000
understanding what labels are

270
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,839
understanding where they can search and

271
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,440
all these kinds of different

272
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:44,320
kind of basic level functions of

273
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:46,480
things like github but it's really

274
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,240
important to understand that that's the

275
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,399
place that most designers are coming

276
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:53,279
from when they want to contribute to

277
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:53,279
something for good

278
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,519
so not only doing research into

279
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:01,760
designers we did a lot of research into

280
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:04,079
existing open source communities and

281
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,880
people that maintain open source and

282
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:06,239
speaking to

283
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:08,240
a lot of people that either are

284
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,760
currently maintaining open source or are

285
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:12,000
looking to

286
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,959
or own their projects when you talk

287
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,440
about them

288
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:16,000
when you talk to them about design they

289
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,880
say

290
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,480
things like logos and graphics or ui and

291
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:24,720
that really undersells

292
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:27,279
the value of design as a many

293
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:29,200
many splendid function that encompass

294
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:31,120
encompasses usability and user

295
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:33,200
experience and service design

296
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,560
lots of different things are of benefit

297
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:37,600
from the design industry

298
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,599
for open source

299
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,680
but it's not to downplay the use of

300
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:44,240
jargon in the design

301
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:45,439
community as well and how isolating that

302
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,519
can be from the

303
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,200
open source perspective as well so

304
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:52,240
there's a lot of work to be done

305
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,959
on breaking down how we use our

306
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,440
functional

307
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:58,880
language within our profession and how

308
00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:02,000
inclusive or exclusive that can be

309
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,480
um around inclusivity as well oss

310
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,800
project

311
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,399
issues can be really restrictive in what

312
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,319
even if they know what kind of what they

313
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:09,519
want to ask for as far as a design

314
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,120
contribution

315
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:13,360
they can be incredibly restrictive i had

316
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,160
a lot of designers looking at issues and

317
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,680
saying well they're just

318
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,920
telling me what they want rather than

319
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:22,160
asking me to explore a problem

320
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:22,160
that they want solved using design

321
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:32,800
and similarly or similarly

322
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:35,200
the if you take a very open

323
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,319
approach to say workshops with with an

324
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,880
open source project

325
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,480
to designers what you tend to get and

326
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:44,399
this is what we got in those first

327
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:46,640
unfunded events was that they lose focus

328
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:48,240
and they lose relevancy to real issues

329
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:51,360
that need to be progressed within

330
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:53,200
open source projects so

331
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,639
on the one hand issues can be very

332
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:57,200
restrictive and not

333
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:57,839
inclusive for designers but then when

334
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,240
you say

335
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:01,680
improve our product they create things

336
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,680
which are

337
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,800
not able to be actually implemented what

338
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,399
we tend to call

339
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:09,279
something like vaporware or design

340
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:12,240
fiction within the industry

341
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:15,920
fascinating solutions but not nowhere

342
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:17,600
near immediately implementable

343
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:19,279
and then there's the lack of version

344
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,040
control in

345
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:22,480
various different kinds of software that

346
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:25,040
designers use

347
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,639
and also the lack of kind of a process

348
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:28,800
for version control as well in a

349
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:32,320
language around version control

350
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:33,839
and also something about how we approach

351
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:38,320
the idea of collaboration

352
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:42,079
and sharing within the design community

353
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:42,880
a lot of challenges so i want to talk

354
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:44,399
about what we

355
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,920
what we did what we did with the project

356
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:47,279
so we investigated we did all this

357
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:50,479
research we did a lot of

358
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:52,320
interviews we have an open repo and

359
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,240
with all of the information all the

360
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:56,560
research hosted on that repo

361
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,399
but i want to talk through the

362
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:00,560
activities the workshops that we that we

363
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:04,240
did and what we changed

364
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:06,160
so we did two uh workshops

365
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:08,000
uh two subsequent workshops after

366
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:11,439
developing a very

367
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,959
um a testable but based off of the

368
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,440
research that we created

369
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:17,199
a testable methodology a testable

370
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:20,240
workshop framework

371
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:22,079
and a way of constructing specific

372
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,279
way of constructing issues in a much

373
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:26,079
more

374
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:28,320
design friendly but also implementable

375
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:32,160
into the oss way

376
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:34,880
we did one of the workshops in

377
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,519
bangalore in india which was as part of

378
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,720
the design

379
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:41,360
up festival which is a conference

380
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:43,040
primarily for designers

381
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:45,279
and we focused there on one of

382
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:47,599
ishihidi's crisis tools so ishihidi

383
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:50,639
makes a few tools that are to do with

384
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:52,320
crisis response and humanitarian aid and

385
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:53,920
we really focused in

386
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,279
on the location that we were hosting

387
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,560
this workshop this is one of the key

388
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:57,839
things that we discovered was really

389
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:00,959
important

390
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:06,079
so we focused in on the kerala flooding

391
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:09,040
that happened in 2017 and 2018

392
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:11,279
and we made sure that the challenges

393
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:13,680
that we were bringing to that location

394
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:14,399
and those designers were ones that were

395
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,399
relevant

396
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:17,600
and familiar to them so that they had a

397
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:19,360
connection

398
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:23,040
that that feeling of doing something for

399
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:25,440
good was embedded within their community

400
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,240
we did our second one in taipei in

401
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,040
taiwan

402
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:30,079
and we focused in on typhoons and how it

403
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,240
affected rural

404
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:35,040
farmers and their livelihoods after

405
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,040
those typhoons

406
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,480
to talk a little bit about what we

407
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:43,440
brought to the workshops

408
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:44,880
as far as activities that we did we did

409
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,639
a few different ones we did something

410
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:50,560
called empathy mapping

411
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:52,959
defining the problems ideation

412
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:54,239
storyboarding and then we went into live

413
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:56,079
prototyping

414
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,279
and the idea was at the end of these

415
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:59,920
workshops

416
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:01,519
which we tested two different structures

417
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:04,560
to the workshops

418
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:07,440
was that each challenge or issue

419
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:08,638
would have a tangible contribution of

420
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,800
some kind of design

421
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:12,800
at the end of the workshop so these

422
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,880
workshops were about a day long

423
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:18,160
one of them in bangalore that we tested

424
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:20,720
a full day so from a 9 a.m to a 6 p.m

425
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:22,000
a full sort of exhausting day of

426
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:25,199
designing

427
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:28,079
and in taipei what we tested was two

428
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:30,560
halves with a remote sprint in between

429
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:31,279
so we did a four hour workshop to

430
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:35,199
introduce

431
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:37,600
the project introduced open source and

432
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:38,319
the first exercise which was embassy

433
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,480
mapping

434
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:42,720
we did remote sprint activities which

435
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,639
were the subsequent activities here

436
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:46,320
and then we finished with another four

437
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:47,839
hour workshop a week later

438
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:50,000
with the sketching and prototyping in

439
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:52,000
person we wanted to see whether there

440
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,959
was a difference in these two different

441
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,560
structures

442
00:15:52,959 --> 00:16:01,199
to get better contributions or

443
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:01,199
more sustainable contributions

444
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:05,759
so to go into two of the very key things

445
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,000
as well

446
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:09,279
other than um other than what i've

447
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,880
covered already

448
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:14,720
on what makes a design related

449
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,920
workshop around your oss really

450
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:19,600
important

451
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:20,639
was one of them was inviting into the

452
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:24,320
process

453
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:27,279
a witness so not only making that

454
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:29,040
the issue of the open source relevant to

455
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:32,399
that location that you're taking

456
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:33,839
um taking that workshop too so

457
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:35,759
the designers within taipei are the

458
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:37,360
designers within bangalore but it was

459
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:41,279
bringing in a witness that had

460
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:43,440
had experienced the need of the software

461
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:44,480
so in in the case of the crisis

462
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:47,680
communication

463
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:51,279
uh oss tool that we were building for

464
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:51,839
we had two witnesses the bangalore

465
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:53,920
witness

466
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:54,880
was a person that had done extensive

467
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:57,920
research

468
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:59,680
and aid delivered aid out into the

469
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:02,319
kerala flooding area

470
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:04,559
and she was our key witness to be able

471
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:06,079
to give feedback to the designers and to

472
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:08,240
bring them into the relevancy of what

473
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:09,599
they were designing how how close was it

474
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:11,760
to the designers so

475
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:14,020
how close is it to the user's need so

476
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:15,199
she was really there to

477
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:17,359
[Music]

478
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:18,799
test whether it was working whether the

479
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:21,839
solutions were working

480
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:23,839
and in taipei we had one of the farmers

481
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:25,520
that had been devastated by one of the

482
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:26,480
his farms had been devastated by the

483
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:29,600
typhoons

484
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:31,039
and a volunteer organizer that

485
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:33,120
coordinated an effort to go in and

486
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:37,039
relief that relieve those farms of

487
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:37,039
of what they needed during the typhoons

488
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:42,160
so it's really key having essentially

489
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:43,840
your users of your open source there

490
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:47,200
with the designers so that they can

491
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:49,840
experience who they're helping

492
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,799
the second one is the process of

493
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:53,918
translating

494
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:56,400
issues into design challenges

495
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:57,200
so there's an example here from the repo

496
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,559
that we

497
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:02,400
that we worked on and some of the things

498
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:05,039
that you really need to go into depth

499
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,240
on are who are the different users of

500
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:07,919
this potential

501
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,760
potential issue if you have an admin

502
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:11,840
state versus a

503
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:13,120
another estate what are the problems

504
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,639
that you're trying to solve what are the

505
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,678
ways in which you've maybe tried to

506
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,440
solve it before

507
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:19,679
what's all the information from your

508
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:21,039
team basically as much information in

509
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:22,960
that issue as possible

510
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:24,720
though we did realize that there was a

511
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,440
point in which there was too much

512
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,360
information

513
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,679
for designers and it became uh

514
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:31,199
restrictive in a different way and

515
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:32,799
rather than too little in through there

516
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,160
was too much info so we've met a happy

517
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:37,360
medium now with this

518
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:40,160
issue here and

519
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:42,719
to show you what came out of it was a

520
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:45,440
series of different prototypes

521
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,640
so each of the workshops had multiple

522
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,559
different teams

523
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:50,320
and they self-selected their teams based

524
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:51,280
on their skills that they wanted to

525
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:53,918
bring to

526
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:55,200
that team we tried to evenly disperse

527
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:56,080
different kinds of skills or at least

528
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,480
people that were willing

529
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:59,840
to perform different kinds of skills so

530
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:03,200
product management

531
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:04,799
uh wireframing sketching lots of the

532
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,640
different skills so that the work was

533
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:08,639
evenly shared across the team

534
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:10,799
and at the end they produced a testable

535
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:13,280
prototype something that somebody could

536
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:14,879
click through to go into the field and

537
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,600
test with so they could also show our

538
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:19,360
witnesses

539
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:23,439
what they completed so

540
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:26,399
to wrap up the aims of the

541
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,960
open design project going forward are

542
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,120
still

543
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,320
to increase and sustain contribution

544
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:33,120
from designers to

545
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:34,960
open source to support the community and

546
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:37,280
that means both the design community and

547
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:39,840
the open source community

548
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:41,039
to build the understanding between those

549
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,959
two functions

550
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:44,320
to start to break down the jargon start

551
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,400
to break down the bridges that we may

552
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:48,320
have constructed over the years of our

553
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:51,120
operations

554
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:52,000
and bringing open design to education

555
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:55,039
and workplaces

556
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,799
to start making sure that oss is valued

557
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:58,640
within the design community and within

558
00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:01,600
our workplaces as well as our

559
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:02,720
educational institutions

560
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,240
some of the things that you can help

561
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,840
with if you're interested is we want to

562
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:07,520
build more relationships with different

563
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:09,439
oss projects

564
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:11,280
so we don't want this to just be of

565
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:13,120
benefit to ushahidi

566
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,559
unishihidi's tools this framework this

567
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:16,080
methodology all the different things

568
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:18,840
that we've learned we want it to be

569
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:20,879
usable and relevant for any open source

570
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:23,840
project

571
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,880
and you can find the resources here on

572
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:27,360
the

573
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:29,200
open design repo so we've got five

574
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:31,918
minutes and that's

575
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,559
it we go now okay five minutes left for

576
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:36,880
questions

577
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:39,129
you you flash five minutes left

578
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:43,280
thank you thank you

579
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:46,720
[Applause]

580
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,720
you could still squeeze in a question

581
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:50,400
yes so i come from the education

582
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,080
background

583
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,159
one of the things i think is challenging

584
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:55,360
for people like me who are deep in the

585
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:57,520
software side is

586
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:59,199
i think in the design world there's that

587
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,879
difficulty to

588
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,799
sharing your work sometimes because of

589
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:05,440
how the industry is and

590
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:06,158
it's you know you feel like that's your

591
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,320
that's that's

592
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:09,600
your work that you're you're losing out

593
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:11,520
yeah obviously what would be what do you

594
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:13,120
think would be a better approach to

595
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,720
being more inclusive or inviting

596
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:16,639
designers into the conversation

597
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:18,080
in terms of like the language and some

598
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:20,880
of the ways that we talk about

599
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:21,360
specifically around education i guess

600
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,400
yeah

601
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:25,439
so um the institution that's already has

602
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:28,200
a module

603
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:30,000
around open source is a technical

604
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:32,080
university in darmstadt

605
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,120
with their design students it's really i

606
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,720
went to visit and it's really

607
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,760
fascinating to see design students

608
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:38,799
getting really

609
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:40,320
like having that educational basis

610
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:42,799
so i'm really hopeful that there'll be

611
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:45,678
more institutions building in modules

612
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:46,879
um i think that this is partly a

613
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:50,720
question about

614
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:52,240
what we call design ego um

615
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,760
there is such a thing it's a very

616
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:56,240
complicated topic

617
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:57,120
but there is not really there's only

618
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:00,720
recently the

619
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:03,439
the examples within corporate world of

620
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,240
actively sharing either functions or or

621
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,320
being

622
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:07,520
not just critiquing like there's a

623
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:09,280
there's a good

624
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:11,520
history of designers critiquing each

625
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:12,000
other almost critiquing each other's

626
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:14,320
work

627
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,039
too much um for the sake of critiquing

628
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:17,840
but

629
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:19,039
um yeah there's we're still building up

630
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:22,639
these processes of

631
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:25,679
opening up like how we did stuff like

632
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:26,080
a lot of what design has struggled with

633
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:29,840
was

634
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:32,480
over the years is it's a validity as a

635
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:35,039
job function like often design is

636
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,039
regarded as

637
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:39,919
like a very enjoyable job because it's

638
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:41,120
creative in a lot of ways when it's it's

639
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:43,440
a job like many others

640
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:44,399
it's a very it's a very complicated um

641
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:48,159
topic but i think

642
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:50,000
what you can do is what i found works

643
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:52,400
is having somebody that speaks a

644
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:55,120
reasonable amount of design language

645
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:56,720
that the designers can connect with that

646
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:59,918
also speaks a reasonable amount of

647
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:01,200
open source language so that um

648
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:02,960
with some of the workshops we actually

649
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,360
got developers coming along and learning

650
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,360
design

651
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:06,559
activities as well which was really cool

652
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:08,240
and fascinating

653
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:10,158
but yeah having that balance of somebody

654
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:13,760
that can kind of be a bridge

655
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:18,880
um allows them to flexibly bring in the

656
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:18,879
the two topics on an even platform

657
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:24,159
cool i don't want to take up more time

658
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:28,158
because yeah but

659
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:28,159
it's like we can still squeeze in a real

660
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:37,840
shotgun

661
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:53,120
sure so

662
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:58,720
so i guess one of the things that might

663
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:02,240
be most interesting oh so the question

664
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:03,440
um was around agile methodologies or

665
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,640
things that are used in the agile

666
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,960
process and maybe

667
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:08,640
bringing some of those in to how we're

668
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,720
working here or could they be brought in

669
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:13,760
and would they be valuable

670
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:16,240
um so as far as my knowledge goes

671
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:18,720
there are agile process there are not

672
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:19,440
specific design agile processes but you

673
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,320
can

674
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:23,279
have something called a design sprint

675
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:25,600
and one of the

676
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:26,400
one of the people that we worked closely

677
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:29,360
with

678
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,919
was the global virtual design sprints

679
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:32,559
and they

680
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:33,919
came out of austin texas and they now do

681
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:35,918
a global virtual

682
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:36,960
like remote across the world design

683
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:40,159
sprint so they

684
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:43,200
are really trying to push the idea of

685
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:45,520
global remote for good

686
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:47,200
design sprints which is super cool check

687
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:50,240
check those folks out

688
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:51,200
um there are some things that i think we

689
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:53,200
could benefit from

690
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,960
retros for one thing it would be great

691
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:58,400
to be able to build into this

692
00:24:54,960 --> 00:25:00,240
this um process the ability for the

693
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,760
oh the open source project and the

694
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:04,400
designers to

695
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,799
do a retrospective on what was created

696
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,840
um

697
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:08,559
also building in um structure around the

698
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,879
sprints

699
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:13,120
so i structured the remote sprint around

700
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:14,559
these activities but there are

701
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:16,719
there are further sprints that i

702
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:18,559
structured that

703
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:20,240
again if we get further funding or if we

704
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:22,080
carry on the project then

705
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:23,279
that's what i would like to test next

706
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,480
and then actually the next thing that i

707
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:27,360
wanted to test

708
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:29,279
out after these activities was a sprint

709
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:32,320
for the designers that was so

710
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:33,760
focused solely around user testing and

711
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:37,039
how to support

712
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:39,679
um open source design user testing

713
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:40,640
processes so that's all structured and

714
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:44,320
kind of ready to go

715
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:44,320
just needs the

716
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:57,840
needs of either the funding or the

717
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:57,840
support or yeah those kinds of things
