1
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:10,240
so now we have uh

2
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:11,280
john mark uh talking about monitoring

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,360
strawberries

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:16,640
also happens to be my favorite fruit

5
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:22,400
which i don't get in india

6
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:25,359
[Applause]

7
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,680
okay hello everyone thank you for having

8
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,880
me

9
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,320
thank you for organizing this room i'm

10
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:33,440
very happy to be here today

11
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:36,239
to discuss uh how we build observability

12
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:37,680
in our projects uh it's agriculture so

13
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:40,320
you'll see it's not going to be a very

14
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,600
technical talk but what can be

15
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,399
interesting for you is that

16
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:46,320
we're going to look at observability

17
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:49,760
from the perspective of iot

18
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:52,079
and also from agriculture

19
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,280
because as you will see we basically

20
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,360
leverage

21
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,320
iot technologies to grow fruits and

22
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:59,600
vegetables

23
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:03,680
inside cities so

24
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:06,000
first we need to talk about strawberries

25
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:07,200
i've been living in in paris this past

26
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,400
two years

27
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:13,600
and most strawberries you can buy there

28
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:16,080
they actually come from spain or morocco

29
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,039
so they actually do travel a lot before

30
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,400
they reach

31
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:22,320
the store and this is why sometimes

32
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,759
on the top of the strawberry you might

33
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:27,919
see some white circles

34
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:30,479
on a white crown is because the fruit

35
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,400
was harvested way too early before its

36
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:33,520
full maturation

37
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,960
and they do that in industrial

38
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,560
agriculture so that the fruit can

39
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,720
continue the maturation during

40
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,240
transportation

41
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,920
and this is how they can extend the life

42
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,920
of the of the product

43
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,680
but the issue with that is that during

44
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,720
the transportation the food is going to

45
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:50,000
attack

46
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:52,079
its own reserve of nutrients and so

47
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,560
when you buy it it might not be that

48
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:58,639
tasty and the nutritive quality

49
00:01:54,560 --> 00:02:00,719
can be very bad and of course the second

50
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,479
big problem with lung transportation is

51
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:04,479
the use of pesticide

52
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:05,920
so another technique used to extend the

53
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:08,639
life of fruits

54
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,399
and it raises tons of questions about um

55
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:13,760
the impact of that farming model

56
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:15,360
on our health so what we try to do at

57
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:18,319
agricool is um

58
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,920
to get rid of the transportation part in

59
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:22,399
the farming model

60
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,920
so we produce fruits directly inside

61
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,080
cities

62
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,519
so that we can harvest them at full

63
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,200
maturation and so that they are very

64
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,920
tasty and very healthy

65
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,839
and of course always pesticide free and

66
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:37,119
the way we do this

67
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,400
we we buy these containers and inside of

68
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:42,160
them we set up an

69
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:43,120
iot infrastructure to grow plants and to

70
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:46,480
grow

71
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:50,640
fruits and vegetables

72
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:52,000
this is how it looks inside so we always

73
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:55,920
start from a blank

74
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:58,800
uh container and then we set up

75
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:00,640
vertical columns we can plug the plants

76
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,760
inside these columns

77
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:05,359
we have walls of leads to provide the

78
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,879
lighting and the energy for the

79
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,920
photosynthetic activity

80
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:11,920
of the plants we also set up an

81
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:13,518
irrigation system that goes through the

82
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:17,200
columns

83
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:19,840
and we also have a quite complex

84
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,399
climate regulation system made of an

85
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,640
industrial

86
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,799
air conditioning system and a bunch of

87
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:28,640
misting pumps to control the humidity

88
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:31,200
in the air and also a set of

89
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,798
hair fans to control the the air

90
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,280
circulation

91
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:37,519
so whatever we need to set up in terms

92
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,959
of sensors and actuators

93
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:41,040
to have perfect control over the

94
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:44,159
condition of storage so that they get

95
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:46,049
like the perfect setup to grow

96
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:47,359
we install it um

97
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:50,159
[Music]

98
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,840
so for example we also install hives

99
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:54,319
from bubble bees

100
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,080
so that burger bees can take care of the

101
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:57,599
pollination of flowers

102
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,280
and this is also something we can

103
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:00,798
control with iot

104
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,120
so that we can control the door of the

105
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:04,879
hive and so i find great control over

106
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:08,560
the exposure between flowers

107
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:10,560
and bumblebees this is the end result

108
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,720
this is how it looks like

109
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,000
this one is located in parque de merci

110
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:17,759
in the very center of

111
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,279
paris here is another one decorated by

112
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:22,639
an artist

113
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:26,400
and so now we have around 15 containers

114
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:28,160
in paris it means that

115
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,080
if you buy a planet or strawberry from a

116
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,120
record in the supermarket

117
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:34,159
you know that you're dealing with a

118
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:36,160
fresh product the harvesting date

119
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:38,160
for the tourists will always be on the

120
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,680
box so you know you're buying stories

121
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,120
that were harvested the same day or the

122
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,320
day before

123
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,320
and so you know you're dealing with a

124
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:48,320
fruit that is fully matured

125
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:50,719
and with no pesticide we've ran some

126
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:52,400
analysis to compare stories with other

127
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:55,280
stories from supermarket

128
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,758
and on average we reach 20 percent more

129
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,960
sugar

130
00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:03,039
and 30 percent more vitamin c so pretty

131
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:04,799
high uh nutritive quality

132
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:06,159
if you want to to build something like

133
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,280
this you need to run

134
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:11,280
a ton of research on plants so we are

135
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:13,039
running a couple of buildings in paris

136
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:15,919
where we have set up

137
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:16,639
uh this uh these cells for experiments

138
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:19,280
these are like

139
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:21,280
smaller versions of containers and in

140
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:23,599
each cell we can test one variable

141
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,638
of the environment so that through trial

142
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,280
and error you can

143
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:28,960
we can discover the perfect recipe for

144
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:31,840
the strawberries

145
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:33,520
um and to run one single experiment it

146
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,799
takes a bit more than three months

147
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:37,840
because that's the time you need to grow

148
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,600
strawberries so it means that you need

149
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:41,679
pretty good reliability during three

150
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,360
months in your iot system

151
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,360
otherwise you might mess up the

152
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:49,120
experiment and your results won't be

153
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:51,600
useful and

154
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:54,160
to build an infrastructure like that you

155
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:56,560
need a team of people

156
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,600
made of a very diverse set of technical

157
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,360
skills

158
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,120
so of course we have a lot of

159
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,520
agronomists

160
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,720
to run the research and so they

161
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:07,919
basically discovered

162
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:10,319
the agronomic recipe then our engineers

163
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:11,680
will try to build the physical

164
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:13,280
infrastructure that will make that

165
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,680
recipe a reality

166
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,559
inside the containers and then we have

167
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,720
the software team

168
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,680
made of software developers and devops

169
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,680
engineers

170
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,039
and so our goal is to work very closely

171
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:26,400
with these engineers

172
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:28,800
and agronomists so that's rewrites

173
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:30,159
the best iot infrastructure to automate

174
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,280
these containers

175
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:34,160
and make the recycle reality so right

176
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:37,758
now

177
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,560
we are around 90 sorry between 80 and 90

178
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:41,039
people

179
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,479
and seven developers in the software

180
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:45,759
team

181
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:46,080
so let's look inside in every container

182
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,000
we

183
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:50,400
install a machine with a debian instance

184
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,680
on it this machine can communicate

185
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:56,719
with the outside through a 4g connection

186
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:59,120
and locally it will communicate with a

187
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:02,000
plc controller

188
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,520
you can see this controller as a unit

189
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,479
that centralizes

190
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,799
all the input output interactions with

191
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:09,039
our

192
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,120
devices so all the sensors and all the

193
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:13,199
actuators

194
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,960
so basically with this controller in one

195
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:17,039
place you can read the values of all

196
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,638
your sensors and also the positions of

197
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:20,639
all actuators

198
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:24,400
and you can also forward new commands to

199
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,400
change the position of these actuators

200
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:29,280
on the debian instance we can deploy our

201
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:32,240
software stack

202
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:33,198
mainly we have a set of micro services

203
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,240
written in golang

204
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:38,400
and a parameters instance so in

205
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,319
parameters we will store

206
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,840
time series for the values of all our

207
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:44,800
sensors and also the positions of all

208
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:47,280
actuators

209
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:49,039
and the main goal of the microservices

210
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,400
is to regulate the environment in the

211
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:52,719
container

212
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,878
so for example we have a service for

213
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,479
climate regulation

214
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:58,479
that service will communicate with

215
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:59,840
parameters to read past values from

216
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:02,639
sensors

217
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:03,758
so it might send an http request to

218
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:05,520
parameters to ask

219
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:07,039
what's the average temperature over the

220
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,400
last five minutes

221
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:10,639
and if the service sees that the

222
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,520
temperature is far too off from our

223
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:13,440
target

224
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,639
it will run some climate regulation

225
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,400
algorithm

226
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:17,840
and the output of the upgrade might be

227
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,719
some new commands for the for the

228
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,239
actuators

229
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,240
so it might decide to change your

230
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,360
setting in the air conditioning system

231
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,680
or to activate

232
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,199
a misting pump to bring more humidity in

233
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,840
the air

234
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:31,680
so this is how you can use a plc

235
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:34,718
controller with time series to

236
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,719
to regulate inside

237
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:38,478
if we zoom out you can see that we

238
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:39,838
replicate

239
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:42,800
the same infrastructure in every

240
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:46,160
container and we use a docker images to

241
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:48,240
to make these deployments and then uh

242
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,360
in the cloud layer we deploy all the

243
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:53,040
user facing

244
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:55,440
web apps to build the observability

245
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:57,040
so all the time series from prometus we

246
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:00,480
centralized them into

247
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:01,439
an influx instance we put a graphene on

248
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,560
top of it to build

249
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:07,279
all our dashboards and graphs

250
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,920
we also use radash to build dashboards

251
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:10,320
of our

252
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:12,000
sql stored data in our postgres

253
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,680
instances

254
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,480
and we also built quite a few

255
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:19,839
observative pipelines over slack

256
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:22,640
because all our employees are using it

257
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:23,839
so for example in parameters we have uh

258
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,360
error tools

259
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:27,600
to tell us when there are incidents in

260
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,800
the containers these are truths will be

261
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,320
received on slack

262
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,839
so that we can send the technical

263
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,519
support so in the container to fix

264
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:35,040
things

265
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:36,720
and so in these areas rules you might

266
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:39,760
you might find your typical

267
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:42,880
ideals about your network

268
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:45,839
your services cpu loads

269
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,480
memory usage but you also extend the

270
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:50,480
definition

271
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:52,080
of rules to new layers in the artistics

272
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54,480
so we write tools for the

273
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:56,399
physical machinery with there and also

274
00:09:54,480 --> 00:10:00,480
rules for the plants

275
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:02,839
so for example in every water pipes

276
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,720
in the containers we have a pressure

277
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:06,640
sensors

278
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,160
and so the values on the sensors are in

279
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,000
parameters so we can detect when there

280
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:13,439
is a huge change

281
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:16,399
in water pressure and so these changes

282
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:18,640
they will trigger alerts and

283
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:20,079
they might indicate that there is a leak

284
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:22,480
in the hydraulic system

285
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:24,319
and so this is how we can send a plumber

286
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:26,880
on site

287
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,880
to fix it

288
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:33,120
so when we think about authority we

289
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,880
often think about

290
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:38,000
these techniques you know time series

291
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:41,360
metrics domain events traces

292
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:44,399
alerting and then we apply them to

293
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,120
different sets of abstractions and so in

294
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:47,040
our projects what

295
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:49,680
we try to do is to be very conscious

296
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:52,480
about extending the application

297
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:53,359
of these techniques to the physical

298
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,079
machinery

299
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:58,720
uh in the containers and also to the

300
00:10:56,079 --> 00:11:00,160
world of agronomy and plants

301
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,000
and the only way you can do that

302
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,600
successfully is to work very closely

303
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,600
with domain experts

304
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,680
you need to involve the engineers and

305
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:10,160
the agronomists in the process

306
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:11,359
so that they can basically educate you

307
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,800
about the domain

308
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,720
and so that you can discover together

309
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:17,839
what are the most valuable

310
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,880
authority pipelines to build and when

311
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:20,880
you do that

312
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:22,320
you will discover new techniques that

313
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:25,760
you need to

314
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:28,560
to develop so for example

315
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:29,600
inside your containers we have a set of

316
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:32,800
cameras that

317
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:36,000
pictures automatically of the planes

318
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:37,359
and the pictures get uploaded to a wss3

319
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,279
and then we have our ergonomist

320
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:41,440
reviewing these pictures

321
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:42,320
and so they can discover if there is

322
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,000
something wrong

323
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,079
with the plants by looking at the leaves

324
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,120
and the flowers and the fruits

325
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:51,120
so it's very human-centered pipeline but

326
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:54,320
we'll still consider it

327
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:55,920
as a full authority pipeline because it

328
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,399
gives us really good indication about

329
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:59,680
whether

330
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:01,600
the system is healthy or not and we do

331
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:03,519
this type of human central approach uh

332
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,600
in different ways we send

333
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:06,720
ergonomists inside the containers to

334
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,880
check the plants

335
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,800
we run testing sessions for our

336
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:13,200
strawberries we analyze

337
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:15,199
water samples from the hydraulic system

338
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,800
and we also make a ton of measurements

339
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,839
on the plants like measuring the the

340
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,599
size of the leaves

341
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:22,000
to see if the plants are developing

342
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,000
correctly

343
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,600
so we always try to automate the

344
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:27,839
pipelines as much as possible

345
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,040
but when it comes to to plants it's it's

346
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:32,720
too complex and we need

347
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,719
to put humans in the loop a lot

348
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:38,719
so some of the specific specific changes

349
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,720
with agriculture

350
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,320
first we are an iot company so we we

351
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,600
have to manage this huge fleet of

352
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,240
sensors and

353
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,839
actuators and they are distributed in

354
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,399
different places in paris so it comes

355
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:51,920
with its

356
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:53,920
own set of constraints then with plants

357
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:57,920
you can get a very tough set of

358
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:59,920
ergonomic slas so for example a single

359
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:03,120
incident in one container may be enough

360
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:04,800
to impact the full batch of strawberries

361
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,880
let's say your irrigation system goes

362
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,800
down for a couple hours

363
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:10,639
it might be enough to to damage the

364
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,079
entire production and so have a very big

365
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:15,360
impact on the bottom line of the

366
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:17,680
of the business and when it comes to

367
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:19,519
strawberries and berries in general it

368
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:22,319
can be very tricky

369
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:24,079
because floors and fruits are super

370
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,839
fragile

371
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:27,519
we're pretty well known in the indoor

372
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:29,120
farming industry for growing stories

373
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:31,120
because most companies they grow herbs

374
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:33,200
and salads

375
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:35,040
but with berries you you need to be to

376
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,000
be very precise in terms of temperature

377
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:39,920
humidity

378
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:43,040
irrigation levels and finally

379
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:44,800
plants can are very complex

380
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:47,040
it's an illusion to believe that you can

381
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:49,519
retro engineer a plant

382
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,639
it's way too complex so in practice what

383
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:53,279
this means is that

384
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:54,880
if there is an incident you cannot

385
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:56,079
always tell if it has an impact on the

386
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:58,480
plants or not

387
00:13:56,079 --> 00:14:00,719
you can look at them you may see some

388
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,320
some sign that it's healthy or not

389
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,760
but you will never get the full story

390
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,480
because you will never know everything

391
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,199
that's going on

392
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:08,959
inside the plant so it's always a good

393
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:09,839
practice when you write a postmortem to

394
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:12,000
try to

395
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:13,600
measure the impact on your business but

396
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,800
when it comes to plans it's just super

397
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:18,560
difficult for us to do

398
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:20,639
so what we've learned by navigating

399
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:22,319
these constraints is that

400
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:24,240
your observative pipelines they should

401
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,800
always come from an instance

402
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:28,079
so you should not kill them just for the

403
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:30,800
sake of coping with

404
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:32,079
the ongoing observative trend and so to

405
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,880
do that we have this very simple

406
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:35,359
framework that

407
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:36,880
for us what's valuable is to get

408
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,720
feedback on whether we're building the

409
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:41,439
right farming model

410
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:42,399
are we going to have great fruits enough

411
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,639
volume

412
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:47,920
and do our unit economics make sense so

413
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:49,600
that we can scale to multiple cities

414
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,959
and so from the definition this is what

415
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,880
we want to see

416
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:54,719
we want to see observations that help us

417
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:57,519
react to incidents

418
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:59,519
to understand uh how the stories respond

419
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:01,519
to the conditions we're giving them

420
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:03,040
we want also to try to predict what's

421
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:04,160
going to be the yield and quality of the

422
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,560
product

423
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:09,279
and also any insights that could help us

424
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:12,800
improve the united economies

425
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:14,399
um so for example in our system we might

426
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:16,240
have a

427
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:17,600
water pump sending water in the

428
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:19,600
hydraulic system

429
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,639
uh if we start monitoring the state of

430
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,560
that pump

431
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:24,240
we may discover that we don't use it

432
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,680
that often

433
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,279
and so in this case later on we might

434
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:29,519
make a decision to

435
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:31,439
downgrade it to a cheaper model and this

436
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:33,199
is how we can make a

437
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,920
unit economics decision driven by

438
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:38,880
monitoring data

439
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:39,279
so let's see the framework in action uh

440
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,360
what's

441
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:43,199
always super valuable for us is to

442
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:46,880
assess nutrient absorption

443
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:47,519
by the plants so basically if a plant is

444
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,600
absorbing

445
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:51,279
its nutrients correctly it's going to

446
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:54,160
grow healthy and provide us with

447
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:56,639
great strawberries one way to do this is

448
00:15:54,160 --> 00:16:01,519
to use vpd metrics

449
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:03,440
vpd stands for vapor pressure deficit

450
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:05,199
and it's kind of an indicator of the

451
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,480
intensity of the transpiration of the

452
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:08,479
plants

453
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:10,240
so if you take a plant the leaves are

454
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,240
saturated with water

455
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:14,800
and it needs to diffuse some of that

456
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:17,839
water in the hair to be able to grow

457
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:19,920
and this is called the transpiration and

458
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:21,600
during transpiration the nutrients are

459
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:23,279
are moved inside the plants and this is

460
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,759
how they are absorbed

461
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:26,320
so at every stage of growth of your

462
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:28,079
plant

463
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:30,399
you need the right level of

464
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:32,638
transpiration intensity

465
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:34,000
and vpd is a good indicator of that it's

466
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:36,800
basically a

467
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,079
ratio between the level of saturated

468
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,279
water in the leaves and the level of

469
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:41,920
saturated water

470
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:43,839
in the air and what's nice with vpd

471
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:45,839
matrix is that it's fully automated

472
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:48,320
you've got your time series you can be

473
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:48,839
the automated reporting enterprise you

474
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:52,240
can build

475
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:54,639
alerting and then we have other

476
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,759
pipelines for the same concerns so we

477
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:59,120
have our cameras that

478
00:16:55,759 --> 00:17:01,279
upload pictures for us and um

479
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:03,360
if our economists look at these pictures

480
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:05,679
and if they see some droplets of water

481
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:07,679
at very specific times of the day

482
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:09,199
they may get very valuable information

483
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:12,480
about the

484
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:12,480
intensity of transpiration

485
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:16,319
we also run water analysis of our water

486
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:18,720
sample from the

487
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:19,918
irrigation system and if we do that

488
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,760
multiple times

489
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:23,280
through time we may discover some

490
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:27,599
interesting

491
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:31,039
long trend about nutrient absorptions

492
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:33,039
so again some automated approach some

493
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:36,080
semi-automated approach and

494
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:37,679
we need to put experts in the loop

495
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,678
this is the only way we can get like the

496
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:44,080
best observations for us to

497
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:44,080
to know that our system is working

498
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:48,400
so all of this it relates to what we

499
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,480
start

500
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,600
phrasing as a domain driven of the

501
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,840
ability

502
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,799
so the idea that the pipelines are

503
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,240
building

504
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:58,879
they're not just about techniques but

505
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:01,360
they are always related to

506
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,320
either a business objective or some

507
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:05,439
knowledge from

508
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:08,159
from the field of agronomy

509
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:09,840
and so in practice it means that we want

510
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:12,960
our system developers to work very

511
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:15,039
closely with the domain experts

512
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,960
on one hand you want these experts to

513
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:19,280
share their knowledge about the domain

514
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,880
so that developers can learn about

515
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:23,678
physical engineering

516
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:26,000
about climate regulation about agronomy

517
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:27,440
about nutrient absorptions

518
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,440
so that the developers they know why

519
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,960
they're building these pipelines

520
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:34,000
and they know why they should focus and

521
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:36,480
put the priorities

522
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,400
and on the other end it's nice for your

523
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,960
domain experts to learn about the world

524
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,960
of reliability and observability

525
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:44,559
so that then they can understand the

526
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,480
technicality and

527
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:47,600
they can put the project in the right

528
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,520
direction

529
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:51,280
so at agricult we have a ton of

530
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:54,639
engineers and economies that

531
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:57,280
know a lot of stuff about time series

532
00:18:54,640 --> 00:19:00,720
alerting prometheus grafana

533
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:03,520
uh we tried to talk to them about

534
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:04,960
best practices like postmortems and

535
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:08,000
defining

536
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:11,440
slos or other plants

537
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:13,039
and the only way to do this is to speak

538
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:16,080
the same language

539
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:17,840
so you want the wording inside the your

540
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:19,760
or your system

541
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:21,439
to be the same as the one used on the

542
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:23,360
field by domain experts

543
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:25,280
because if you have some type of

544
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:27,840
cognitive distance between the two

545
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,960
it will be very difficult to to add new

546
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:31,439
features to the system

547
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:33,679
and it will slow everything down and you

548
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:35,120
could you could also have like this

549
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:36,720
miscommunications that could result in

550
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:38,479
some nasty verbs

551
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,760
for example if if we don't have the same

552
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:42,799
vpd definition

553
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,799
we're going nowhere

554
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:52,080
and so sometimes when we can

555
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,640
we go as far as enabling our domain

556
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,760
experts

557
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:58,880
to build our iot pipelines themselves

558
00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:01,280
so we have non-computer

559
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,240
people if you want that learn about

560
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,480
influx that learn

561
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:05,440
to write influx queries so that they can

562
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:08,720
build their own

563
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:10,240
grafana dashboards we have people

564
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,919
learning about sql

565
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:14,799
so that they can use redash and build

566
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:18,000
the views over or sql data

567
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:20,000
we even we haven't designed a web editor

568
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,159
for promoting sellers

569
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,640
so that we have agronomists that can

570
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:26,799
write their own parameters alert rules

571
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:28,000
and it will get deployed in any

572
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:30,720
container they want

573
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,200
for them and so it's kind of a trade-off

574
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:34,240
because

575
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:36,000
you are putting more people in the loop

576
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:37,760
so there are more risk for errors or not

577
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,720
following the best practices

578
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,720
but on the other end

579
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:44,559
you remove the bottleneck from the small

580
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:46,000
software team and everyone learns about

581
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:47,600
building observative pipelines and you

582
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
can move much faster

583
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:51,039
so in a startup this is like kind of a

584
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,799
trade-off that you need to

585
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:57,440
navigate so that's it for the slides

586
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:58,960
i guess my final message is that

587
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:01,679
authority is not just

588
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:03,280
about techniques it's very much about

589
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:05,280
the application domain

590
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:07,120
and so i think most projects would

591
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:09,039
benefit from

592
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:10,719
bringing domain experts in the authority

593
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:13,520
journey and

594
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:14,240
to teach them about the best practices

595
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:18,559
and

596
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:20,480
yeah so we are we are growing startup

597
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:22,399
we are hiring so if you like the kind of

598
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:31,840
stuff for your building feel free to

599
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:31,840
send us a message thank you

600
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,720
thanks a lot uh we have four minutes for

601
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:40,559
questions please don't get up

602
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:40,559
please only get up after the q a is over

603
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:45,280
thank you for the joke is any of what

604
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:48,720
you show

605
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:51,840
here open source um no

606
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,840
we we don't do a player

607
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:57,520
no we we're not doing your open source

608
00:21:56,159 --> 00:22:00,000
right now

609
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:01,600
but we we want to do it in the future

610
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,039
right now we're trying to figure out how

611
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:05,039
to grow these plants

612
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:06,480
so we're not investing in uh opening

613
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:08,240
stuff because

614
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:10,960
we're not ready to bring that kind of

615
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:14,159
quality but we are very much looking to

616
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:17,440
to to build some type of uh

617
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:20,000
indoor farming community uh

618
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:21,760
starting in paris and run some open

619
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,320
source academy and this kind of stuff

620
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:25,760
but it's the very beginning for us and

621
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:29,120
so we really hope like in the coming

622
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:29,120
months to boost track something here

623
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:36,158
hi uh i have a question uh so you

624
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:38,399
mentioned there are a lot of manual work

625
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:39,520
involved when your colleagues are

626
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,520
looking at the pictures do you have

627
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:44,720
plans on implementing i don't know like

628
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:46,000
machine learning models to automate this

629
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,120
process because essentially they're

630
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,960
classifying

631
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:50,559
yeah they say they can say it's good bad

632
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,799
or they classify the disease or

633
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:55,600
something something happens thank you

634
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:56,320
yeah absolutely we started uh looking at

635
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:59,520
it

636
00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:01,200
uh so right now we we do the

637
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,720
manual approach basically because we

638
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:05,760
don't have time

639
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:08,320
to build uh the computer vision stuff

640
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,879
we see it as like a new research project

641
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,399
because

642
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,919
it's very hard to estimate the effort

643
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:13,679
you need to put into this

644
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:15,360
since we already have we always have the

645
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:16,559
constraint of already running research

646
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:19,360
on plants

647
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:20,240
we try to remove that risk but we could

648
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,840
definitely

649
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:24,320
because we know the dates for each

650
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:25,918
picture we could definitely do some

651
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:28,879
supervised learning about

652
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:30,559
try to estimate uh the level of growth

653
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:33,520
of the plants so i just discovered this

654
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:34,879
water droplet automatically so we don't

655
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:37,120
have a

656
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,480
nicely tagged data set today but it's

657
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:41,520
definitely going to

658
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:43,760
at scale something we want to do to

659
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:46,000
to make this relative pipeline better

660
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:46,000
yeah

661
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:51,199
how can we compare agricultures the

662
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:54,320
normal farming

663
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:57,600
in it's effective and

664
00:23:54,320 --> 00:24:00,879
how many containers do we need to cover

665
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:04,080
needs of strawberries for dubai like

666
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:05,279
or some small town so it depends on what

667
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:08,158
you mean by effective

668
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:08,960
uh if you mean by by a yield volume of

669
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:11,360
production

670
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:13,760
yes volume of production comparatively

671
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:17,279
to the normal village is it

672
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:19,200
gross so it's it's much more productive

673
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:22,400
than classical agriculture in terms of

674
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,400
the surface you need to use

675
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:26,559
so what we right now we're producing

676
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:30,639
between

677
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:31,120
15 and 20 kilograms per square meter per

678
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:34,240
year

679
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:36,879
so it's much much more than

680
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:38,640
industrial agriculture in terms of the

681
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:41,520
the space

682
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:42,159
you need to use so what's the big

683
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:44,639
challenge

684
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:46,480
today is more about the unit economics

685
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:48,400
and make it work

686
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:51,679
like make this investment in this big

687
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:51,679
iot infrastructure worth

688
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:59,520
so we get much better yield but we still

689
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:02,559
a way to go before making workable at uh

690
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:05,918
it's a bigger scale so we have

691
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:10,000
one more question have you planned

692
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:11,760
something else than strawberry yes

693
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:15,200
so our stories are in supermarket and

694
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:18,320
for a few weeks now we have

695
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:21,919
herbs so coriander basil

696
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:24,639
salads that are getting in the store so

697
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:25,760
these are more easy to produce in terms

698
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:27,440
of

699
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,799
the reliability level you need to reach

700
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:32,480
in the system

701
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:34,639
and yeah our goal is to in the future

702
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:36,400
try to uh to address all the main

703
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:38,320
vegetables and foods that people

704
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:40,840
have in their fridge but right now yeah

705
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:43,840
we focus on on herb salads and

706
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:43,840
strawberries

707
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:51,439
yeah but yeah it's a good question yeah

708
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:53,039
so

709
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:54,640
