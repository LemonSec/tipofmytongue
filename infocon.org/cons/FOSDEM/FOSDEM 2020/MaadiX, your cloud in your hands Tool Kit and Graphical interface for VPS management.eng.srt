1
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:08,879
i am madish

2
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:10,639
i'm presenting maddix the lack of

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,360
imagination today we have to choose the

4
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:14,399
name

5
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:17,520
but maddix is a toolkit that

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,439
allows people to install free open

7
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:22,160
source application on a new

8
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:24,160
server without the need of having

9
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:27,198
technical skills or make

10
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:30,640
a big investment the idea came

11
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:31,679
from my experience with xnet which i am

12
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,880
co-founder

13
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:37,680
and this is an activist group which

14
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:39,360
operates in in things related with

15
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,760
digital democracy

16
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,680
uh privacy protection whistleblower

17
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,440
protection and so on so

18
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:48,079
working with other activist

19
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:49,199
organizations we were surprised to see

20
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:52,239
how many people

21
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:55,120
were using services provided by

22
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:56,160
big corporation and they were creating

23
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,879
actions

24
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,760
and sharing sensitive information for

25
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:02,399
example with

26
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,599
google groups or stuff like that and

27
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,240
these people normally

28
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,320
most most of them were aware that this

29
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,880
was not the best practice

30
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,399
but they had no alternative they said i

31
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,720
i have no says that mean

32
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,720
i have no money to pay one what can i do

33
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:20,000
and we have no answer for that

34
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:23,520
actually so this is what we did

35
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:27,200
build this answer the approach

36
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:30,479
to be this tool was very clear to us

37
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:33,119
we didn't want to be to create a service

38
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:34,079
to offer a service we wanted to offer a

39
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:37,119
solution

40
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:40,240
that will empower users and transfer the

41
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:43,600
responsibility of their data as well as

42
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:47,360
the application to them so we

43
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:48,079
do not run a service with our cis admin

44
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:51,200
that

45
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:54,559
manage their data yeah okay encrypt

46
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:57,520
whatever you want but it would be on our

47
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,960
our responsibility and so we didn't want

48
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:02,000
to reproduce that

49
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:05,119
so we decided that this tool must

50
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,000
run on own service of people that can

51
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:08,878
have at their home or which with

52
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,239
whatever

53
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:15,840
uh internet hosting provider

54
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:19,040
uh so uh

55
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,160
this graph i why did i show you this you

56
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,400
say it's this crazy

57
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,920
because this is at least a complete list

58
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,800
of company owned by

59
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:28,879
alphabet and it's incomplete for two

60
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,680
reasons because in the same wikipedia

61
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:31,359
they say

62
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,760
that it's incomplete and because it

63
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:36,560
didn't fit in my screenshot

64
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:38,160
i made some to make it fit but i

65
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:41,599
couldn't get it all

66
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:44,959
so the thing is uh

67
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:48,160
if somebody needs a email in

68
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:50,400
make the decision to switch or their

69
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,280
their organization from gmail for

70
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,239
example

71
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,120
to another email provider uh which

72
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:57,200
option they have

73
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,239
they could for example use protonmail we

74
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,839
have just seen

75
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:03,920
but on my opinion the the model is not

76
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:06,319
that different i mean you still trust

77
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:08,720
that people from protomail

78
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:09,518
respect privacy and care about that we

79
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,920
say okay

80
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:12,640
i mean i'm not discussing that but it's

81
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,518
just a

82
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,879
technical design right or to turn on

83
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:19,840
that so what happened if

84
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:20,560
tutanota tomorrow belongs to the to that

85
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,720
list

86
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,799
we don't we have the same problem we

87
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:27,440
have not solved the base problem

88
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:29,840
that's why we decided that the the email

89
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:33,440
server must run on people machine not

90
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:36,319
on our uh common email server

91
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,799
and the image is important this is the

92
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:39,280
graph

93
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:41,599
the first one is the gmail users and the

94
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,480
blue bar refers to younger people so it

95
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:45,440
also

96
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,000
uh it shows that there is a tendency of

97
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,920
young people

98
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
to use these tools and it's normal

99
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:53,200
because it works

100
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:56,480
it has a sex interface and you have

101
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,839
a lot of other services once you set up

102
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,480
a gmail account

103
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,599
and you can have it set up in a minute

104
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,760
of course

105
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:04,640
so the alternative if you don't want to

106
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,359
transfer

107
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:10,480
this responsibility from jimmy to

108
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:13,599
another external or more friendly

109
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:15,679
uh privacy friendly company

110
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:18,399
the only alternative you have is to run

111
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:21,600
the email server yourself and this is

112
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:23,520
a guide that you can follow and when you

113
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,240
get at the end this is to install

114
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,639
postpiece

115
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,080
door record without that and when you

116
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:31,120
fire get at the end

117
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,159
this is the result and from here you can

118
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,479
start

119
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,240
creating your first email account and

120
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:40,080
this is not sexy at all

121
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:43,680
so uh many people will end up here

122
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:46,639
and so of course this is pain right so

123
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,759
this is the ideology all i mean the the

124
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:50,800
idea that

125
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:54,639
was with us all the time when developing

126
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:55,840
this tool we so if there is not only the

127
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:58,400
email

128
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:59,679
server of course there are other tools

129
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,320
for

130
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,280
there are a lot but uh next cloud on

131
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,759
cloud

132
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,799
only office online library office online

133
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:10,160
uh a lot

134
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:12,080
a rocket chat vpn so people can from a

135
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,360
graphical interface that we have

136
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:16,400
developed

137
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:18,800
and which is installed on on server

138
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,400
when you start using mavic's uh with

139
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,759
this graphic from this graphical

140
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,080
interface you just select

141
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:25,600
the application you want you push the

142
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:28,800
install button that

143
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:32,080
is over there and the the

144
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,919
installation process starts

145
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,680
from the same graphical interface you

146
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:38,240
can also manage other things

147
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,360
you can get a look at how the how your

148
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,479
system is

149
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:44,479
you can create users give them access

150
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:46,960
you can create vpn accounts you can

151
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:48,719
create virtual hosts for your domain

152
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:52,159
and all the typical things you need in a

153
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:55,360
server so but how does it work so

154
00:05:52,160 --> 00:06:00,479
you can think about maddix as the recipe

155
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:03,600
of a repository sorry of recipes

156
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:04,000
that people can download and apply on

157
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,120
their

158
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:10,240
own server uh this

159
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,800
now i i will show a slide that you would

160
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,240
say oh

161
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:17,520
no yes this is these are the technology

162
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:19,280
we use but

163
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:22,000
some of you in the hall may you know

164
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:25,520
that antiball and pocket are not really

165
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:29,360
privacy friendly tools but we changed

166
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:32,240
the way we implemented them so

167
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,600
for opennet nebula we only use that in

168
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,919
case we also provide

169
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,880
hosting to set up a virtual machine but

170
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:40,080
if you want to use

171
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:42,639
amazon we don't use open level you

172
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,440
you give us you provide the server

173
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:46,639
yourself

174
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:49,599
so the first okay it's a part so

175
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:50,960
ansible we just use it at the beginning

176
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:54,159
to set up the first

177
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:57,919
very basic installation so

178
00:06:54,160 --> 00:07:01,199
we do not uh offer

179
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:02,960
using maddix in servers that are

180
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:05,039
already the previous configuration

181
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:07,599
because it would be a mess for us

182
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:08,560
to calculate all the possible panoramas

183
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:11,919
we prefer to

184
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:15,680
go on developing rather than

185
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:18,400
solve different scenarios so

186
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,280
once ansible basically what does is

187
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,758
install

188
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:23,440
the puppet client people could say no i

189
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:26,560
want to do that my own

190
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:30,160
okay but i mean we have all the

191
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:33,120
all automatized why not so and we

192
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,599
could one day make an image that people

193
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,400
can

194
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:38,639
install or but we go slow because

195
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:41,758
because we are a small project anyway

196
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:43,840
so then puppets once you have

197
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,759
the puppet install you run a forced

198
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:48,318
puppet agent this is how it's

199
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:48,960
called it's called and the puppet agent

200
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:52,319
talk

201
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:56,719
to this repository and ask

202
00:07:52,319 --> 00:08:00,560
him in it her i don't know to download

203
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:02,319
the the basic uh and to configure the

204
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,919
the base of the system which includes

205
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:06,960
the graphical interface the

206
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:10,240
ldap uh directory and

207
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,878
mysql and all the base yes based

208
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,000
packages

209
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:17,840
so puppet normally is

210
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:22,479
not good for this purpose to to to build

211
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:24,878
autonomous and and privacy

212
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:26,080
oriented tool because puppet normally

213
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,879
needs to know

214
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:30,318
all the secrets about the machine that

215
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:33,440
is talking with with it

216
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:34,159
i mean to install for example a mysql

217
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,959
server

218
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:37,519
puppet needs to know which to provide

219
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:40,239
which

220
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:41,839
password will be used as a root password

221
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,320
for the mysql server

222
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:46,399
and normally puppet stores this

223
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,800
information on the master server

224
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:49,760
and this was something that we didn't

225
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,000
want

226
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:54,640
so what we do we solve this problem in a

227
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,680
very silly simple way but it works it

228
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:58,480
works like a sham so we cheat the puppet

229
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:02,000
master

230
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:04,640
so that it is using fake templates

231
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,600
with fake values that are common for all

232
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,839
installation

233
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,880
and upon the installation is always

234
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:12,320
terminated

235
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,959
the machine locally generates its own

236
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,160
secrets

237
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:19,119
and overwrites these secrets with

238
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:20,000
the one that was used by puppets and

239
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,279
that way

240
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:26,800
we not only i mean there are two

241
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:29,519
two benefits of this way of working one

242
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,160
is that under security point of view we

243
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:32,480
don't

244
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:34,160
store in the same place a lot of secrets

245
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,800
of people which we don't want it would

246
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:38,240
be

247
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:41,279
quite uh quite a mess for us

248
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:42,320
and second users can apply own

249
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:45,439
configurations

250
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:47,760
and puppet wouldn't then overwrite

251
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:49,120
this personal configuration in a normal

252
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:52,640
environment puppet

253
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:55,680
would do that right so

254
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:58,880
um then it's

255
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:01,199
great but then a lot of people who are

256
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,240
an organization who are actually in high

257
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,079
risk area

258
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,680
started using maddix because it was

259
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:08,880
useful for them they could

260
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:11,920
have in infinite

261
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:13,519
vpn account without asking anyone it was

262
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,439
very agile for them

263
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:17,200
and so suddenly we get concerned about

264
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:20,800
the security because we took

265
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:24,079
care about that but you know so we

266
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:26,560
asked somebody external

267
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:27,199
externally to make a security outlet

268
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:30,319
which

269
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:31,519
we did with uh open uh radically open

270
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:34,959
security

271
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:35,760
and the thing is that from this security

272
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:38,239
audit

273
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,439
the result was that there were a lot of

274
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,680
recommendation

275
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,480
that we are now in the face of

276
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:45,199
implementing

277
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,240
in order to ensure the security of all

278
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:49,200
the system

279
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,160
and this represents for us a big

280
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:53,680
challenge

281
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:56,319
because uh we have to translate

282
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:57,040
all these concepts to the graphical

283
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,320
interface

284
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:03,279
we don't want people to avoid using

285
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,720
this security indoor enforcement because

286
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:06,079
they are too complicated so we are

287
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,959
making an effort we are not

288
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:10,079
expert in ux so we are making an effort

289
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:13,439
we will

290
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:14,239
need help on that and also because for

291
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,519
example

292
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:20,720
the security audit says that we just

293
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:22,880
show a low tls version 1.2

294
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,000
and we know that there are people using

295
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:27,600
medics that have

296
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,519
old browsers that do not support that

297
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:32,640
they may have problems so

298
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:34,160
it would we put transformatics in

299
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:37,040
something

300
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,920
impossible to use not working you know

301
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:41,839
so

302
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:43,439
we decided to leave this decision to use

303
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:46,480
so now we are implementing

304
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,959
all views all interfaces related with

305
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,560
these

306
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:53,920
issues these security issues

307
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:57,359
and um so uh

308
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:58,399
maddix you can use once install the

309
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:02,240
application you want

310
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:03,040
and not use it anymore you cannot talk

311
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,200
with the

312
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,079
with the server you can actually

313
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,360
uninstall

314
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:12,079
the puppet or whatever but

315
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,639
what we do we also provide updates

316
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:15,519
because

317
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:16,560
one system once it runs you need to to

318
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:19,760
maintain it

319
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:23,359
and so we publish periodically new

320
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:24,079
releases in which typical we have bug

321
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,560
fixes

322
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:27,599
security enforcement new application

323
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:31,199
updates for

324
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:34,160
existing previous applications so

325
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:36,000
the important thing on that is that this

326
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:39,680
graphical interface

327
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:43,040
is not running any comment

328
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:46,719
it's just an interface from where

329
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:49,360
all the from where user inserts

330
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:51,279
uh data which are written from this

331
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:54,399
interface which is a jungle

332
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:55,839
uh based in jungle and bright in the

333
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:59,120
eldar

334
00:12:55,839 --> 00:13:02,320
so then there is the crown

335
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:05,040
who is reading this eldar and if

336
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:06,000
it finds that something must be done

337
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:09,760
because there is

338
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,560
a status who changes so the puppet is

339
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,279
triggered

340
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,279
otherwise no

341
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:20,800
for example these are some

342
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:21,920
custom models we have developed we also

343
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,319
use some

344
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:25,199
models from the puppet forge and these

345
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,839
are

346
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,560
models that run locally on the machines

347
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:31,680
so not

348
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:32,638
every time the client needs to talk with

349
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:36,079
the master

350
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:37,040
there are for example uh when creating a

351
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:40,239
new

352
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:41,839
uh a new a new domain and you need to

353
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,720
create the virtual host this is

354
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:45,199
something that

355
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,920
the machine can carry out locally on

356
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:49,359
their own

357
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:52,000
using these puppet models yes so

358
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:53,440
what what it happens is that if a new

359
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,639
domain is added

360
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:59,360
the uh the domains module

361
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:00,079
turns into a locket status so the cron

362
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,120
read that

363
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:04,880
and perform all the necessary tasks in

364
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,720
order to create the virtual host the

365
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:10,800
little encrypt certificate

366
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:14,079
the web root folder and all that

367
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:17,760
so we are

368
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:20,160
always working on on this tool

369
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,880
we have a lot of time working on this

370
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:24,639
tool

371
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:28,720
and we are now planning to add

372
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:31,839
new tools such as moodle

373
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:34,240
then also we want to add something for

374
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:36,240
online forms which are not pretty sure

375
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,639
which is the best solution if you can

376
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,680
have

377
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:40,880
el pas on that but basically the the

378
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:44,479
decision

379
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:46,560
uh to to add a new feature is from the

380
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,279
feedback we receive from people that are

381
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:50,319
using that

382
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:52,639
so uh but yes we want to

383
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:54,160
add the kanban that there is nothing

384
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:57,279
right now for that

385
00:14:54,160 --> 00:15:00,000
uh and there is

386
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:00,320
you have to think that medics can can

387
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,360
run

388
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:05,519
on a very small machine we use very

389
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:08,560
little docker just for the application

390
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:12,240
that had only docker support

391
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:14,560
with with a dockerized image support and

392
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:16,079
all the other stuff are integrated and

393
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:20,160
we just use

394
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:22,959
debian because we it's easier for us

395
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:24,839
to just give support to one operating

396
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:27,518
system

397
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:30,000
and and of course people

398
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:31,600
have root access to their machine it's

399
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,079
their own machine

400
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,519
uh they have access they everything is

401
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:38,239
written in the log

402
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:40,480
we didn't publish the the server side

403
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:42,880
because it's just a puppet with

404
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:45,199
with the models we use and most of them

405
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:46,959
we publish the one we have developed

406
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:48,240
but the other one are from the puppet

407
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:50,239
porch directly

408
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:52,320
so also that all the sources are

409
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:54,800
downloaded directly from

410
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:56,800
if you if you download another mysql

411
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:59,599
server it's downloaded directly from

412
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:00,880
with debian from the source so yes we

413
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,120
would like to make a better

414
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:04,639
documentation not all the infrastructure

415
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:08,320
we will do but you know we are

416
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:11,440
always uh behind the the

417
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:13,600
timetable but this is our intention

418
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:15,279
and i think it's all i hope you have

419
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:23,839
understood what we do

420
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:23,839
and thank you very much

421
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:28,000
thank you very much there's a lot of

422
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:30,239
time for questions does anyone have a

423
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,240
question

424
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:39,440
i would like to ask you are aware of

425
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,399
you know horse and cloudren and cloud

426
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,959
yes

427
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:45,519
yes the difference is that you know

428
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:45,518
horse clothes

429
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:52,399
yes the other one is i tell you um

430
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:53,519
hi the one that the guy went to work

431
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:57,920
with

432
00:16:53,519 --> 00:17:00,399
cloudflare you know how is that custom

433
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:01,360
yes i know what i do what are the

434
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:04,480
differences

435
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:07,039
yes before starting we

436
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,760
load it because if this solution already

437
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:10,799
exists

438
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:12,240
why repeat ourselves so the difference

439
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:15,039
with cloudron is that

440
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:16,959
on cloudron if you install on your own

441
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:19,199
another application and then you

442
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:20,160
update the classroom it will override

443
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:23,919
all your

444
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:24,880
custom things they say that on their

445
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:27,439
website

446
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,160
so it was not useful for us because it

447
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:30,960
was just

448
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:32,559
for us it was it but x is the tool that

449
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:35,440
avoid repeating

450
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:36,320
boring tasks such as installing you know

451
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:39,200
but

452
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,840
people need to have the freedom to then

453
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,320
make

454
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:46,080
the customization of their own system so

455
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:49,600
this was not useful for us

456
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:52,639
samsung sandstorm for something

457
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:54,719
is more complicated for users if you

458
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,679
want to set up a website and make it

459
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:57,600
accessible

460
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:59,120
with the domain some configuration and

461
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:02,240
you still need have

462
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,639
to have some skills in order to install

463
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:06,240
them

464
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:07,600
run it and so on and among these three

465
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:10,640
you know hosts is the one

466
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:12,159
we love more we think it's great

467
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,280
yesterday we were talking with people

468
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,919
from the project

469
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,399
and the thing is that in this case also

470
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:19,440
uh

471
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:22,559
people need to somehow

472
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:25,440
have a scissors name capable to make

473
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:28,559
some little maintenance on the one hand

474
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,679
on the other hand we saw that the their

475
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:32,399
interface

476
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:33,840
yes is running scripts directly and we

477
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:36,640
thought that

478
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:38,799
under a security point of view it was

479
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,679
not a good decision we wanted something

480
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:41,918
that

481
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:43,520
uh avoided that could mark this

482
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:46,559
difference in this separation

483
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:49,918
and on the other hand these systems

484
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:51,039
allow us to also provide service service

485
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:54,400
as a cis admin

486
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:57,520
i i refer to bigger organizations

487
00:18:54,400 --> 00:19:01,679
and provide them a very customized

488
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:03,760
uh configuration for the server

489
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:06,080
because for example we can we could

490
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:08,480
create a

491
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:11,120
template just for them if we want you

492
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:13,840
know so and we do actually we do we

493
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:15,520
give maintenance and and support to

494
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:18,799
bigger organization

495
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:19,679
and they ask us for example of a future

496
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:22,080
that

497
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:24,000
it only works for them you know so we

498
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:26,240
don't we just can work

499
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,200
that way also with bigger organization

500
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:30,320
and but we have

501
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:33,200
systematized all the this admin

502
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:33,520
work which is borrowing and repeating

503
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,880
and

504
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:40,160
so on any more

505
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:43,280
questions we still have time

506
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:47,120
uh would it be possible to um

507
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:48,639
install it on a like my own machine that

508
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:52,639
i have running in my basement

509
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:57,200
your own pc yeah yes you could

510
00:19:52,640 --> 00:20:01,120
but think it's a server environment

511
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:03,360
and the with local

512
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:05,039
installation the problem is the ip if

513
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:07,678
you're changing ip

514
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:08,720
think that you have for example uh let's

515
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:12,000
encrypt

516
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:13,679
uh certificate generated but then if you

517
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,799
change that fee everything could break

518
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:19,919
you know so okay you could but

519
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:20,879
take into account this thing about ips

520
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:24,799
for example to

521
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:27,760
install the rocket chart you need a

522
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:30,240
a long domain or subdomain the process

523
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,879
automatically creates the virtual host

524
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:34,080
so

525
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:35,919
if your isp change your ip

526
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:37,840
your mavic server is up or you

527
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:40,640
won't work anymore

528
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:41,520
but yes it can work you can for example

529
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,679
the site

530
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:46,240
then you make some configuration in the

531
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:49,840
site to work to use it just in a land

532
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,840
and so it could work

533
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:02,399
how do you do major upgrade major

534
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:06,320
upgrade oof

535
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:08,720
we did from jesse to to stretch

536
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:10,399
and in this we need to a little bit

537
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,280
communicate with the user it's not just

538
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:14,559
the button

539
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:17,678
but that what we did was

540
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:20,480
uh button in which users send us

541
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:21,200
um like a report because so we see if

542
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,760
they had

543
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:25,200
made some uh installed other

544
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:28,240
applications

545
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:31,200
you know to see if the if their system

546
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:33,120
has some application that we are not in

547
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,640
is not included in the upgrade for

548
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:38,320
example

549
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:42,080
then we have automatized

550
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:44,480
part of this process but we

551
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:46,799
every machine that we have that we did

552
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:50,240
their grade from jesse to stretch

553
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:51,039
we said to people come to drc write this

554
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:53,919
comment

555
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:56,080
do that i mean we you know we had to

556
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:59,200
communicate because it's a major agree

557
00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:03,360
we tell them do a backup before

558
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:06,480
everything so this is a little bit

559
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:07,039
more complicated we could not get just

560
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,960
one click

561
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:11,840
but because we prefer also that we

562
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:14,000
prefer to have a conversation with them

563
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:15,439
be sure that they have a backup

564
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,600
and sit like that because we don't

565
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:20,080
provide the cap to people

566
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:22,480
then we are going to implement encrypted

567
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:24,879
backups so we will also maybe find a way

568
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:27,840
to solve that but see the moment we do

569
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,840
not provide the cap

570
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,840
sorry here in the in the gitlab there

571
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:34,720
are some

572
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:36,720
pre-stretched stretch manifest that you

573
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:38,640
can get a look of what they do

574
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:41,919
that is the preparation to go to from

575
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:43,600
majestic to stretch you can read them

576
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:46,240
and did you automate also the

577
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:49,360
installation configuration of uh

578
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:52,799
things like a fail to ban or climb up

579
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:54,399
uh stuff like that so we have

580
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:56,720
this a spam assessing for example

581
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,600
something that user can install until

582
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:01,760
now we

583
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:04,080
for everybody is level three but we will

584
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,879
add the option to increase or reduce

585
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,879
this level

586
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:08,480
and for pay to ban also the

587
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:12,799
configuration see now

588
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:16,720
is the default and it's for ssh

589
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:19,840
savile apache code and so on

590
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:21,760
but i mean now is already it's included

591
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:24,000
by defaulting on all servers

592
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:24,799
not a package that people can decide to

593
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,840
have or not

594
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:31,120
this is mandatory in this case

595
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:34,799
but yes we would like to add the the

596
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:36,959
opportunity to you know to change the

597
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:38,400
for example we will need to pull the

598
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:42,320
opportunity to

599
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:43,679
unban ip from this cultural panel

600
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:46,080
because a lot of people

601
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:47,120
for example when configuring the

602
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:50,158
thunderbirds

603
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:51,760
yes they make errors and so they get

604
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:54,240
funds from their job

605
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:57,440
you know so we would like to add a

606
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,440
customization for that

607
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:05,279
hello how do you decide which apps

608
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:07,679
are included in the library of apps

609
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:09,919
how does it work we started because we

610
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:13,039
needed this tool so we started putting

611
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:15,440
the tool the apps we needed and to end

612
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:18,080
the community we were working with

613
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:18,720
and then some other that we didn't think

614
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:21,840
of

615
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:23,279
uh were requested by people that were

616
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:25,360
already using medics

617
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:27,840
and so when we saw that it was not just

618
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:30,320
only one person but

619
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:31,678
more than once so we decided okay they

620
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:34,720
all write this

621
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:37,120
app is useful so if somebody uh

622
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:38,960
request that uh would be great to have

623
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:40,000
this application and it's not really a

624
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:44,000
crazy

625
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:46,240
thing that is we we had it

626
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,520
and you said you're going to add new

627
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:51,840
apps in the future

628
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:56,720
yes and the future is six months because

629
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:59,199
we want to add moodle and we want to add

630
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:00,159
we were thinking about the line survey

631
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:03,120
you know to

632
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:05,600
create online form but it's not really

633
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:07,520
so much easier to use for i mean it's

634
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:10,158
the interface on my opinion

635
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:12,000
is not so clean so we are digging and

636
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:15,760
investigating

637
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:18,159
why uh why not

638
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:19,120
which alternative could there be for

639
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:22,559
that if you know

640
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:29,840
some we would love to to to

641
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:29,840
check more okay thank you very much

642
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:36,149
[Applause]
