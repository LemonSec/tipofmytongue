00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:08,719
hello everybody first of all

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,240
thank you very much for coming to this

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,880
talk

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,480
we are going to present a dashboard we

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:17,359
have been creating the last

6
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:18,080
three months trying to show the current

7
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:21,600
status

8
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:24,959
of the iot project in the open source

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:27,680
so in this slide you can see the url

10
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,480
so if you want you can just now go to

11
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,840
the url

12
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,920
and start playing with the dashboard we

13
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:35,600
are going to present now also these

14
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:38,480
slides are in the in the talk

15
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,120
a page in the default website so you can

16
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,959
also download

17
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:46,480
the light you want now this is a

18
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:48,079
depression 0.1 because our idea

19
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,599
is to present you this version of the

20
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:52,960
dashboard but

21
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:55,120
from now try to do it in a community way

22
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,239
trying to incorporate the views of the

23
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:59,120
iot community

24
00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:00,160
so this is is a kind of tool for

25
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:03,440
everybody in the community

26
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,440
so this is our main goal

27
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:09,680
so my i am alvaro castillo from

28
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:10,720
i'm working right now in quesados

29
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:14,560
developing

30
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:15,840
another iot platform but mainly i'm on

31
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,080
opposition's advocate

32
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,119
and also i'm developing in several open

33
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,158
source projects

34
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:25,439
now i'm working with the plc forex

35
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:27,360
guys that they are creating

36
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:28,639
a framework for communicating with the

37
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,880
industrial protocols

38
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:33,520
in order to offer a common api for

39
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:37,439
communicating with with them

40
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:40,960
and valerio is presenting this

41
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:41,839
with me okay i'm a grimoire lab

42
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,000
maintainer

43
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,439
and house contributor since greenwood is

44
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,399
part of

45
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:49,039
chaos and i work for bitter yeah that is

46
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,960
maintaining

47
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,960
the platform that we used to build the

48
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,720
dashboard i wear anyway the plush the

49
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:57,839
cluster needs open source

50
00:01:54,720 --> 00:02:00,158
and you can use it if you want and

51
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,079
okay my interest is are source code

52
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:03,200
analysis atl processes and reverse

53
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:05,360
engineering

54
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,960
and i know basically nothing about iot

55
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:10,399
but i was just announcing

56
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:13,120
the data okay

57
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:14,879
so this is a outline of the of the

58
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,200
presentation

59
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:18,000
we are going to present you some of iot

60
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,560
architectures

61
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,720
because we have based our analysis in

62
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,640
these architectures trying to

63
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,760
find a common categories that we are

64
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,079
going to use

65
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,599
in the present in the dashboard and the

66
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,239
presentation to compare

67
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:34,319
the status of iot in different in

68
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:37,120
different categories

69
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:39,280
and we have followed some criteria to

70
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:42,080
select this open-source project because

71
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,200
uh you can imagine that selecting

72
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,720
between the hundreds of

73
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:48,720
operation projects that uh exist in iot

74
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,160
is something that is difficult so we

75
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:53,120
have decided

76
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:54,480
to focus in the projects that are

77
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,760
already in the

78
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,679
open source foundation the main open

79
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:59,760
source the apache foundation exclusive

80
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,760
foundation and linux foundation

81
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,200
and after that we are going to show you

82
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,440
some findings and insights

83
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:07,200
and some conclusions about about our

84
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:09,840
work

85
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,958
so why are we doing that what is our

86
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,319
main motivation for creating that

87
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:15,040
digital war

88
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:15,760
probably the the motivation is on one

89
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,920
hand

90
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,760
understanding the iot community i have

91
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,238
joined this community around six months

92
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,480
ago

93
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:24,239
and i want to know the projects the main

94
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,480
projects different architectures

95
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:27,440
and to get this knowledge about about

96
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,920
this

97
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:32,159
this world and also to offer visibility

98
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,399
of the main projects in open source

99
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:36,079
both of us are believers in open source

100
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,480
and we want to

101
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,599
collaborate them as possible in this

102
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:42,159
field

103
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:42,720
and how are we doing that in grimoire

104
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:44,640
lab

105
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,080
we work together in the past and the

106
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,798
focus of the

107
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,680
of the platform is to doing analytics

108
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:52,159
about

109
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,519
software development communities and we

110
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:55,840
are using these tools

111
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:56,879
to extract this information from the

112
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:01,680
several communities

113
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:04,959
in iot and

114
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,760
as i said at the start we want

115
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:07,840
contribution

116
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,679
by the iit community in order to have

117
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,040
this as a search tool in the in the

118
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:14,400
community

119
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:15,120
some warnings about our work the first

120
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,280
one

121
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,840
is that initially we are pretty focused

122
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:23,679
in the industrial iot

123
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:25,679
sector but after some thoughts about it

124
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,199
iot and industrial iot are not so

125
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,000
different so in some way they are

126
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:30,479
merging

127
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,360
the technologies so it is not so so so

128
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,719
important

129
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,320
about the brain selection and

130
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,280
classification is something pretty

131
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,440
dividable

132
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,719
so for example when we start showing you

133
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,320
the categories

134
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,240
and how we have classified the projects

135
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:44,400
in this category you can say okay

136
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,919
this is a project i know i know about it

137
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,239
and you have classified it in a category

138
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:48,320
that

139
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,680
is not the best category so it's

140
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,639
something that we can discuss about it

141
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,639
and we can modify

142
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:54,840
the report and create future versions

143
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:57,440
improving with your

144
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:58,400
knowledge and we are using pretty basic

145
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:01,120
metrics

146
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:03,039
baseline metrics because we prefer

147
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,759
having this as a simple report simple as

148
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:06,320
well

149
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:07,919
in order to send clear messages and if

150
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,400
there are interests and we have value in

151
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:10,960
it

152
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:12,239
we can go deeper with praise like cows

153
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,880
from linux foundation

154
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,000
that we here we have here a photo for

155
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:19,199
for past friday

156
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,840
that they have uh i'm eating heroes in

157
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:21,280
brussels

158
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:23,039
and we can cooperate with these

159
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:26,239
communities in order to have

160
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:28,080
more advanced metrics and about the data

161
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,000
we use creative combined electricities

162
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:32,400
for all the data we are producing

163
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,960
that the data that we're creating but

164
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:38,479
you are going to see data from github

165
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:40,479
and this data at the end is from the

166
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:42,400
developers that are providing this

167
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:44,639
information

168
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,758
okay about the selection of the projects

169
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:49,440
i

170
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:51,199
i have talked about it a bit but

171
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,960
at the end we decided to sell a project

172
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:54,080
from the from the main of insurance

173
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,799
foundations

174
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:58,240
probably you can say that with apache

175
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,680
eclipse and information

176
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,840
also the mozilla foundation is working

177
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:04,840
in the weather in global things

178
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:07,840
but they are working in a pretty

179
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:09,679
specific a part of ivory

180
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,599
these foundations are working in several

181
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:14,960
categories with different projects

182
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,960
so we think that they are

183
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,240
this is a better solution now but this

184
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:21,440
is something that we can change

185
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:24,639
okay and about the comparison we have

186
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:27,600
uh analyzed the iot

187
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:28,400
and we have different different

188
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,840
architectures

189
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:33,280
and we have at the end uh decided to

190
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,960
use some categories to classify the

191
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:37,119
projects in order to compare them

192
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,400
so we are going to present them a bit

193
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:41,759
later

194
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:43,758
so the first step once we have decided

195
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:45,520
to use the project from the foundation

196
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:47,120
is to define how we are going to

197
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,719
classify these projects

198
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,319
in different categories and for doing

199
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,800
that we have put the focus

200
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:54,639
in the iot platforms because they are

201
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,319
really complex platforms that cover a

202
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:57,599
lot of different things other different

203
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:00,800
systems

204
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:03,039
and we have based our analysis in them

205
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,400
so i'm going to spend more more time

206
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:06,400
here

207
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:08,719
these are the basic features in this

208
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:11,198
kind of of platforms

209
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,840
and the first one we have used is the

210
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:13,759
one

211
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,960
that is the reference architecture from

212
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:17,360
the

213
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,080
industrial internet consortium that is a

214
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,400
consortium

215
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,758
that is defining the different standards

216
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,239
in the iot fields

217
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:26,080
and they are and they have a strong

218
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,560
knowledge and position in the iot

219
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:29,520
and we find that this is a interesting

220
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,280
one

221
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:33,599
and you will find here that there are

222
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:35,280
three tires the exciter the platform and

223
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:37,759
the enterprise either

224
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,960
this kind of architectures is a symmetry

225
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:39,919
the same architecture that we are going

226
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,400
to find

227
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:44,479
in the architectures provided proposed

228
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:46,560
by the different foundations

229
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:47,840
i'm going to enter in details because we

230
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:51,280
are going to lose all the time

231
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:53,840
if i do that but if we compare

232
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:55,679
this this high level vision with the one

233
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:58,799
for eclipse foundation

234
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:01,919
that they also propose to have

235
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:03,520
three tires the constrained devices the

236
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:05,120
gateways and smart devices and at the

237
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:08,400
end the cloud platform

238
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:10,560
you can map it against the previous one

239
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,599
and if you take a look to the proposal

240
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,520
from the linux foundation the

241
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:14,878
architecture proposed by them

242
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,878
they are proposing an architecture and

243
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:17,440
also the different projects they are

244
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:19,120
also

245
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,520
and so we classifying them in these

246
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,720
architectures you can find here also the

247
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:26,000
three layers

248
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:27,680
the three tires in the same way so

249
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,039
it seems that there are common patterns

250
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,960
between all the architectures that we

251
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:32,479
can use to classify our projects in a

252
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,559
common way for all of them

253
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:35,680
that this is the goal we have following

254
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,880
the in the presentation

255
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:39,039
and talking about the advances over

256
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,599
foundation they don't try to create this

257
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:41,679
kind of

258
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:44,240
approach a strategic approach trying to

259
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:46,959
classify architectures in iot and so on

260
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:48,800
they just offer a very attractive

261
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:50,079
framework a very traffic platform to

262
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,560
work inside

263
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,680
apache and they have in the big data

264
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,439
clearly they have

265
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:57,120
attracted the best of open source

266
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,279
projects about big data

267
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,640
and in iot they are also attracting some

268
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:04,240
pretty interesting projects but

269
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:07,199
mainly focusing in data

270
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:08,000
so reclassification after doing an

271
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,640
analysis of

272
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,839
all of that we have concluded that the

273
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:15,120
best categories

274
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:16,560
for iot are these thing categories that

275
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,080
we have here

276
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,599
probably in the next release of the

277
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,279
report we are going to use to simplify

278
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,880
that and for example the four categories

279
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:23,680
are ecosystems that are pretty generic

280
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:26,240
categories

281
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:27,519
we are going to merge in another one but

282
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:30,640
the idea is to have

283
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:32,160
one category for always mainly real-time

284
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:34,959
operating systems

285
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:36,399
and virtualization in the aids also

286
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:37,119
about protocols the different protocols

287
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:40,640
used

288
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:42,320
to communicate in this iot field

289
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,680
about the the gateways the software

290
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,519
using the gateways

291
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,920
that are a critical part of the of the

292
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:49,839
platform the processing of the data

293
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,360
doing the persistent of the data in the

294
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:53,920
age

295
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,800
frameworks and platforms that are

296
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:58,160
analysis

297
00:09:54,800 --> 00:10:01,199
that cover most of the different systems

298
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:03,600
and at the end the application frame was

299
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,560
designed to deploy applications that are

300
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,519
going to

301
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:09,599
use the iot information the iot data and

302
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:13,200
process it

303
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:15,120
for doing added value things and at the

304
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:18,160
end the focus ecosystems

305
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:20,320
that are the the useless ones okay

306
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,920
so now valerie is going to present you

307
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:25,839
the

308
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:27,920
lab yeah so as alvaro said

309
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:29,200
the idea of this work was to understand

310
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,839
the iot

311
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:33,440
ecosystem and after they find the

312
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:35,440
category the idea was

313
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,680
to have a dashboard so some way to

314
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:40,880
visualize these categories and how to

315
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:43,120
understand this uh this ecosystem

316
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:45,360
so we use dreamworld lab green lab as i

317
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:48,640
mentioned before is a

318
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:51,680
platform free open source and uh

319
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,319
is used to make for software development

320
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,079
analytics

321
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,920
so in this case we can see that we have

322
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:57,599
a this is our view of remote lab

323
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,519
we have different components one

324
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,560
component is in charge of retrieving

325
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:02,480
data from

326
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:04,000
popular data sources used in software

327
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,720
development then we have another

328
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,360
component that

329
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,720
takes care of digesting this information

330
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:12,320
that is stored in uh

331
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:15,440
in elasticsearch uh json

332
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:17,279
based the database and then once we have

333
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:19,519
the information here we can

334
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:21,200
visualize it so we can generate reports

335
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:24,160
or in this case

336
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:26,320
the dashboard so for this specific work

337
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,959
we focus basically on two data sources

338
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,160
that are

339
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:33,279
git and github so

340
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:34,640
we selected the projects uh we we use

341
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:37,439
personal to retrieve the data

342
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:39,279
percival is a tool that simplifies the

343
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,519
life of people that want to extract data

344
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:43,120
from

345
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:45,200
from software development tools for

346
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:47,279
instance from git we extracted commits

347
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:49,839
and from guitar we started we started to

348
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:52,639
request and issues

349
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:54,320
the other two components are gral wasn't

350
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:56,560
used for this work but is used to

351
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:59,519
extract information about source code

352
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:00,319
so lines of code comments synchromatic

353
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:04,399
complexity

354
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:04,399
and then artur is a tool that is able to

355
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:09,040
execute graph and perseverance scale so

356
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:12,320
once we collect the data

357
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:13,920
from git and github we use the

358
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,079
data storage component that is

359
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:18,719
greenwallet greenwalk is in charge of

360
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:20,560
enriching the data so basically we in

361
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,839
this case we are adding information that

362
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:24,319
are not

363
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:26,000
directly available in the data in the

364
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,680
data we are collecting so for instance

365
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,200
if we focus on it

366
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:32,239
we could add here information about

367
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:33,279
programming and if you focus on github

368
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:37,600
we could add

369
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:39,120
information about the number of

370
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,040
comments that is something that is not

371
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,920
directly available in uh

372
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,480
in the github api one important part

373
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:47,839
here

374
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:49,920
is uh the way we deal with identities

375
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:51,200
so in order to understand the community

376
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,680
the iot community

377
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,399
we started collecting the i mean the

378
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,000
information

379
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:58,240
email information that were available in

380
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,040
git and github so according to the

381
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:02,480
uh to the the email the domain we

382
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,319
started classifying and

383
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,399
grouping people together so then we were

384
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:09,440
able to identify people from redact

385
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:11,200
or people from ibm

386
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:13,200
so large companies that are actively

387
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:16,639
involved in iot

388
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:18,480
uh and then

389
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:20,720
we have so these things was done it was

390
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:23,680
done with certified

391
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,560
and then here we reached a point where

392
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,800
we have like

393
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,680
just the data and we need the we need

394
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,359
just to use

395
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:31,120
uh the last component to visualize the

396
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:33,920
data that in this case we use

397
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,639
beta that is an extension of it's a soft

398
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:37,439
fork of

399
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:38,480
kibana that is part of the elasticsearch

400
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,720
ecosystem

401
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:42,240
and the output that you are going to see

402
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:45,440
it right now

403
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:47,120
is basically a dynamic web page

404
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,560
where you can filter and drill down the

405
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:53,040
data to better understand what

406
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:53,040
what you have so

407
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:00,959
okay so this is basically the dashboard

408
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:03,040
so on top you can see that we have a

409
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:05,359
different

410
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:07,120
tabs so in this case since we don't have

411
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,600
too much time we will focus just on it

412
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,760
but

413
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:12,480
you can access the dashboard and start

414
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,480
checking the data

415
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:18,959
we remove the outdoor information

416
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,440
so you will not see here uh the name of

417
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:22,800
people

418
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,440
just the name of the organizations so as

419
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,240
you can see

420
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:28,480
if we start checking what we found we

421
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:31,839
can see that linux apache and eclipse

422
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:35,199
are basically uh there

423
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:37,120
they share the the iot ecosystem

424
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:38,399
and then here you can see the categories

425
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,160
alvaro mentioned

426
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:41,760
so we can see that for instance os

427
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:45,360
visualization is

428
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:50,560
much more important than

429
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:50,560
fog or integration that seems to be site

430
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:54,800
categories of of the iot ecosystem and

431
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,680
then here we have the

432
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:59,359
the organizations so the top one is

433
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:01,120
intel then we have apache

434
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,880
uh the third one is unknown because we

435
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:05,680
were not able to classify

436
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,000
uh the people there so we were not able

437
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,638
to

438
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,079
associate their domain to a company

439
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:11,120
generator you can find people from

440
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:14,319
university

441
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:16,800
or freelancer so in that case

442
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,839
it's clear that they are unknown and

443
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:20,560
then here you can see

444
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:21,360
uh on the on the past five years we have

445
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:24,638
around

446
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:26,800
uh 2000 comments and uh well

447
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:28,160
5 000 people contributing to to the to

448
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:31,439
iot so we are talking about

449
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:33,439
uh um an important community and here we

450
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,240
can see the evolution of commits and

451
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,759
authors

452
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:38,560
uh grouped by the different

453
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:40,399
organizations and again

454
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:42,959
the foundation sorry and here you can

455
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:47,199
see that uh

456
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:50,319
maybe at the very beginning apache was

457
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:50,880
the first one but then eclipse started

458
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:55,839
also

459
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:55,839
contributing to iot uh

460
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:01,730
yeah if we want to change

461
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:01,729
[Music]

462
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,519
the problem the complete history for the

463
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:08,160
last 10 years

464
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:09,120
this is how you can change the detail

465
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,639
that you are analyzing you can see that

466
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,959
the data is automatically

467
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:14,079
reflected here and now we are analyzing

468
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:15,920
the last 10 years

469
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:17,279
while before we announced the last five

470
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:20,719
years so

471
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:23,199
and we have prepared the uh some adult

472
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,560
visualizations that are this one because

473
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:26,000
the one that you see are basically the

474
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:28,239
default ones in greenwood lab

475
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,600
and here this is a summary of the

476
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:33,920
findings we

477
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:36,079
we we got so we can see for instance

478
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:37,439
in the category application we can see

479
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:40,560
that the three foundations

480
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:41,680
are there so maybe apache has more

481
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:44,000
comments

482
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:45,040
but eclipse as a larger community while

483
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,720
linux says

484
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:48,240
more organization contributed to their

485
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,920
project

486
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,600
again we can go for instance to voice

487
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:54,639
visualization and

488
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:55,279
we can see that in this case linux is is

489
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:59,279
leading

490
00:16:55,279 --> 00:17:03,279
this uh this part then we have

491
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:05,599
other the other categories

492
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:07,679
that are for instance the fog one easily

493
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:09,839
there is basically eclipse there

494
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:10,720
and then we have uh persistence where

495
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:13,119
there is just

496
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:14,799
apache so here we have tried to

497
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:16,559
summarize a bit the findings

498
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:18,799
however in the presentation then we have

499
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:20,160
like we left several slides

500
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:22,240
for the people that want to read the

501
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:24,000
presentation so we have tried to put for

502
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:26,480
each category something

503
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,439
we found anyway again if you want to

504
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,679
navigate uh

505
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:32,080
through the dashboard it would be great

506
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:34,880
so then you can like try to

507
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:36,720
answer the question you would like to uh

508
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:40,960
to get answered

509
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,960
um okay

510
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:46,799
so i guess yeah okay so

511
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:48,400
in order to have enough time to complete

512
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:50,639
the slides we are going to

513
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,080
show you yes for example the findings we

514
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,880
have phone for one category we have two

515
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,480
categories

516
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,160
you can take the slides and go for all

517
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,760
the categories in order to understand

518
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,919
the different things that we have found

519
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,879
from the data but for example in the

520
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:03,600
case

521
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,720
of osm virtualization we have only

522
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,559
interesting because

523
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,760
and there is a large community in this

524
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:10,720
field

525
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:11,360
and a linux foundation for example is

526
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,679
the one

527
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,559
that seems to have more activity here

528
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:17,760
but

529
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:18,720
in order to to show you the decisions

530
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:21,760
that we have

531
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:22,240
done building this this information for

532
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,000
example

533
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,760
we have considered that the safety

534
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,880
project is separated from the

535
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:30,080
living foundation that probably is not

536
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,320
totally right because

537
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:34,080
it is not a complete linux foundation

538
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,678
project but it is related

539
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,039
it's a kind of collaborative project

540
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:38,400
from the linux foundation so the

541
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:39,360
relationship between the projects and

542
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,960
the foundations

543
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:43,760
are pretty clear in some cases but in

544
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:46,880
other words there is

545
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:47,440
it is not so clear for example in the

546
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,600
case

547
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:51,200
in these in this category in the case of

548
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:53,199
apache silver foundation

549
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,559
and they have not a lot of activity here

550
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:57,360
now but

551
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:58,399
the x project this morning we have

552
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,320
talked about it

553
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,840
is joining the apache foundation so for

554
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,559
example in the next release of this

555
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,480
report

556
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:05,918
we have seen that for example the apache

557
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,919
is having a lot of commits

558
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:09,280
coming from these news x projects

559
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:12,559
because it's huge

560
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:14,720
it has a lot of different commits so

561
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:15,600
at the end we try to solve the main

562
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,160
projects

563
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,799
and also the the activity the main

564
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:21,919
project

565
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:25,200
and the organization behind if of the

566
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:27,039
if of the categories we have done this

567
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,640
for all the categories so please take a

568
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:30,480
look to the slides if you are interested

569
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:32,240
and if you find strange things that is

570
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,120
possible because we don't know details

571
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,640
about everything

572
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:36,479
we are more than happy that to recite

573
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,360
this feedback from you and to start

574
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,880
improving

575
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:41,760
this this report so these are for

576
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,520
example all of these

577
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,960
different categories you can use the

578
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:48,000
taskbar and just click

579
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:50,559
in a category and all it does work is a

580
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:54,080
filter out for this category and you can

581
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:57,440
analyze the data for it

582
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:58,799
and we have here created a table it is a

583
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:01,679
kind of summary table

584
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:02,480
so in the different categories the main

585
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:04,720
foundation

586
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:06,159
in this category taking a look to the

587
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:08,880
number of companies the

588
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:10,080
size of the committee and so on uh and

589
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:12,000
then

590
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:13,760
the main project in this category for

591
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:17,120
example we have here

592
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:19,120
apache gaming fee projects that we have

593
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:20,799
for example to talk about the end this

594
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,959
morning and at the end the main

595
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:26,320
companies that are

596
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:29,039
there so

597
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:29,039
as a conclusion

598
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:32,960
which mutation is a winner from from

599
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,760
this

600
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:38,240
from this study that we have done and

601
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:40,480
there are good news that

602
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:42,720
for us for balarami the winner is open

603
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:46,080
source because both of them have

604
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:48,159
a pretty close activity between

605
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,678
a global view and taken over to the

606
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:51,520
different categories you can find that

607
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:54,720
the different foundations are working

608
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:56,158
in in most of all of the categories and

609
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,600
some is leading one the other one is

610
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:59,840
leading the other one

611
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:01,199
easy foundation has different strategies

612
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:03,120
so this is pretty good because

613
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,320
for example if some of that is so

614
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:06,080
strategy is wrong

615
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,840
you have the other two foundations that

616
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:10,320
are going to try other different

617
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:11,120
strategies so at the end we think that

618
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:15,039
there are

619
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:18,239
adversity that is really pretty good for

620
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:21,440
for for iod

621
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:22,320
so about the coverage of the of the

622
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:25,039
dashboard

623
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:26,480
but because you can think okay you have

624
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:27,840
deleted the project from the foundation

625
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:30,720
but maybe

626
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:32,080
the foundation have not attracted the

627
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:34,480
main iot projects

628
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:37,120
we have for example project the data

629
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:39,120
with a report from the pack radar i

630
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:41,360
don't know if you know it but it is

631
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:42,879
what is a consultancy that is creating

632
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:44,959
reports

633
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:46,720
about different industrial sectors and

634
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,120
they have a report about the id platform

635
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,120
based

636
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:51,199
on open source here in europe and the

637
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:53,360
main companies according to this report

638
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,320
are boss and eurotech that are also the

639
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:56,399
main companies

640
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:57,678
uh two of the main companies that appear

641
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,679
in the

642
00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:01,280
in the in the dashboard so the data in

643
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:03,280
the dashboard

644
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:04,480
we feel that is it is not the reality

645
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:07,120
and maybe if

646
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:07,919
not uh 90 percent upgrade but it's

647
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,280
pretty cool

648
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:12,400
and it's a good estimation of the

649
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:14,480
current status of the iot community

650
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:16,080
so maybe we are missing the mozilla

651
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:18,960
foundation with the westin's

652
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:19,600
iot but probably we will add it in in

653
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:22,880
future

654
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:24,799
in future reports so

655
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:26,159
one thing that we have found that is

656
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:27,360
important is the collaboration between

657
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:28,320
the different projects

658
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,840
in the different foundations they're

659
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,399
collaborating for example the projects

660
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,158
in

661
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:34,000
apache are working with the projects in

662
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:38,159
apache or also with the project in

663
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:40,159
eclipse analyst foundation and

664
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:42,000
we don't have a lot of data but for

665
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:43,440
example in the project that i know

666
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,840
better the plc4x

667
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:47,520
they are working closely with eclipse

668
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,559
with milo condito and with other

669
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:51,440
projects

670
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:51,678
and for example the clip secura that is

671
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,159
in

672
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:55,200
the iot gateway that is the lean project

673
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:58,240
in this field

674
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:59,520
is heavily based in apache camille so it

675
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:01,600
seems that there are clear collaboration

676
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:03,840
between the projects but we need to

677
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:04,799
try as always to improve it but in open

678
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,320
source pretty is

679
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:08,158
an open source pretty natural to go to

680
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:11,360
collaborating projects so

681
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:13,120
but it's not a bad idea to

682
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:14,559
try to improve this collaboration for

683
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:16,879
example with this kind of

684
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:18,480
of the rooms that is great for for the

685
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:20,080
iot community

686
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,760
and with this network we are trying to

687
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:24,559
also to offer visibility

688

712
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:17,039

[Applause]

724
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:53,520
this is a relative positioning of open

725
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:55,840
source providers for iot solutions

726
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:57,440
did you also look at closed source

727
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:59,199
providers for iot solutions like

728
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:03,520
microsoft amazon

729
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:06,799
to click close charge program

730
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:07,440
closer provider yeah we have put all the

731
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:09,279
focus

732
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:11,440
in open source projects and open source

733
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:13,520
projects inside the foundation so

734
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:14,640
for example microsoft is doing pretty

735
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:16,240
interesting things in iot

736
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:18,080
and the um and there are project open

737
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,559
shoes also but they are not inside the

738
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:21,279
foundation

739
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:22,879
this is why they are not here but

740
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:24,880
probably this is

741
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:26,400
something that we need to change and to

742
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,919
start because they are

743
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:30,880
a player in this community that's an

744
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:33,120
important player so we should find ways

745
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:34,240
so probably in the next release of this

746
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:36,479
platform we're trying

747
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:37,840
to aggregate to integrate other projects

748
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,919
that are not part of the project

749
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:41,360
but we need we but we need to find a

750
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:43,840
clear criteria to do that

751
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:44,559
so we need to think about ways okay why

752
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:47,360
we are

753
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:48,799
adding for example the microsoft

754
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:50,799
projects in github

755
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:56,720
and not for example the projector on any

756
00:25:50,799 --> 00:26:00,000
other provider so these kind of things

757
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:03,360
we have time for one more question

758
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:11,840
so anyone okay

759
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:11,840
thank you guys
