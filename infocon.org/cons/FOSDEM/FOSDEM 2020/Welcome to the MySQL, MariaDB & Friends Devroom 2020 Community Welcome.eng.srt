1
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:15,280
ready to go

2
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:21,759
okay welcome everybody the good news is

3
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:23,519
uh our room this year isn't flooded

4
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,720
uh you were here last year you remember

5
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:26,080
we got flooded in the middle of the

6
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,960
session so we all had to

7
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,639
evacuate and go to another room the bad

8
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,399
news as you can see is we

9
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:35,360
have a smaller room so it is going to be

10
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,719
pretty tight so hang on to your seats

11
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,480
make sure you're running the compression

12
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:41,280
algorithm every time

13
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,839
and hopefully we can accommodate most of

14
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,840
you

15
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,600
so the mysql

16
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,440
developer began the first time we had

17
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:53,680
mysql talks in

18
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:55,440
custom was in 2002 and then the first uh

19
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:58,079
actual dev room i'm getting the day

20
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:01,599
strike was 2009.

21
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:04,239
2012 it became mysql and friends

22
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,920
and last year it became my skill maria

23
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:08,159
