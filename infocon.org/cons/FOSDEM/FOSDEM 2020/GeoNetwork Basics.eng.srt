1
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:11,920
i'm back

2
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:16,400
did you guys miss me so

3
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:18,240
i love your hat that's great um

4
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,759
yeah you always have to acknowledge the

5
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,240
other hat where's in the room

6
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:24,000
so in this case i'm not doing like a

7
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,680
community talk i'm doing a i'm an

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,080
employee talks i got like company

9
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,960
branding and i have no idea what i'm

10
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,880
talking about

11
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,239
which is why i wrote this presentation

12
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,920
so that i would know what i'm talking

13
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:37,040
about

14
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,719
so geocat it's a spatial data

15
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:41,040
does spatial data publication and

16
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:42,480
discovery they really are passionate

17
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,160
about the open source thing they've been

18
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,319
doing open source for

19
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,839
i don't know a long time they were on

20
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:51,199
the scene before i was from

21
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:53,039
2002 2003 um

22
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:55,120
and they're based in banacom they've got

23
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,800
developers in the netherlands spain and

24
00:00:55,120 --> 00:01:00,239
canada

25
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:03,120
this is benecon i'm sure it's really

26
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:05,920
raining there right now

27
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,520
um for anyone who is in the previous

28
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:10,400
talk this looks familiar

29
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:12,000
i'm jody garnett uh i work on a number

30
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,799
of different open source projects i've

31
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,840
been doing open source geospatial

32
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:19,520
since 2003 and i've

33
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,960
really been happy to spend the vast

34
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,759
majority of my career

35
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,960
as a professional open source developer

36
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,040
in order to give back

37
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,080
i contribute to a number of software

38
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,439
communities

39
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:33,360
so i've just come off two tours of

40
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:35,360
being a director for the open source

41
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,960
geospatial foundation

42
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,280
i volunteer with the incubation

43
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,439
committee to help developers

44
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:44,079
and the marketing committee to help

45
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:45,919
people find the developers

46
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:47,759
and i also do a similar role in the

47
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,960
eclipse foundation

48
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:53,200
working to help onboard new projects

49
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,199
there

50
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:58,960
but nowhere on that previous slide did

51
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,240
it say geo network

52
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:04,479
and that's a trouble because geocats

53
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,759
main bread and butter their expertise is

54
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:08,000
in geo network

55
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,038
so this is the presentation i wanted to

56
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,760
read

57
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:12,879
when i joined the company how do i make

58
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:16,560
it go what does it actually

59
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:19,120
do who's it for and what on earth are

60
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:22,160
they using it for

61
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,840
and then as an open source person

62
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,920
who makes this thing what's the

63
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,480
community like you know who's paying for

64
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,480
it

65
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,599
what kind of maturity are we looking at

66
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,640
in the code base

67
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:35,200
what makes it go like is it any good

68
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:37,200
um you know what's its superpower or can

69
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,920
i rewrite it in python in an afternoon

70
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:41,679
like

71
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,679
i just you know those kind of questions

72
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:46,238
so first impression it's got osgo in the

73
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:49,279
corner so that's good

74
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:50,959
vendor neutral foundation

75
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:54,000
here's something that weirds me out it

76
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:55,519
says open source in the title

77
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,080
that's usually a sign that something's

78
00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:00,400
really old and open source is a feature

79
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,000
or it's a sign that it's like really

80
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,120
commercial and this is the open source

81
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,640
teaser

82
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,400
and they're going to try and withhold

83
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,480
functionality for you later

84
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,879
so i'm like ah open source to the title

85
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,959
something's wrong here whoop whoop

86
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:14,079
and then the other thing i like looked

87
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,599
at their logo

88
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,440
and i'm like what's going on with the

89
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:20,480
logo it like

90
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:21,200
so it's wrapping the globe it's got a

91
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,640
little meta

92
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:25,359
data monk dude contemplating the magic

93
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,399
of data

94
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,799
or something and then this top part is a

95
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,799
g

96
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:32,799
but you have to like look at it sideways

97
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:34,560
so i really expect everyone to turn

98
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:37,200
their head sideways it'll be an awkward

99
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,200
bonding moment

100
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,359
yeah so i wasn't able to get them to

101
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,640
have a normal logo

102
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:48,640
they love this thing okay

103
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:50,480
installation and setup um the quick

104
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:52,159
quick start kind of assumed we had a geo

105
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:55,280
network already

106
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:59,359
okay um before we start we

107
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:01,200
it's a java web app it uses java 8. um

108
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,799
use one from your linux distribution or

109
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,879
adopt jdk

110
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:06,080
there's a couple installations an

111
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:09,599
installer

112
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:12,959
war source code and docker but

113
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:15,119
there's no guided on how to use that so

114
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:17,120
as i made the presentation i documented

115
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,880
it so i me i owe the community a pull

116
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:21,440
request after this

117
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:23,919
there's an amazing installer that is

118
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:27,280
written in java or something

119
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:30,639
uh it eventually works yay

120
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:32,239
uh bring your own um tomcat

121
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:35,759
your own application server and drop a

122
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,759
bar in another popular choice

123
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,758
source code is an official distribution

124
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,639
i always love that they're living up to

125
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:43,600
open source

126
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:46,639
in their title and they do have an

127
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,639
official docker image

128
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:52,239
so in terms of setup starting with one

129
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:55,360
of these localhost things

130
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:59,440
we're presented with a nice blank screen

131
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:01,440
we sign in using admin and admin

132
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:03,360
and then we can start to get into this

133
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:05,680
administration console

134
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,440
um you know i went through and i changed

135
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,840
the title and the description so this

136
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,280
would be my

137
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:13,280
catalog and they've got a little example

138
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:15,440
here where we can load in some sample

139
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:17,280
data

140
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:19,919
and that's enough for me to actually

141
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:23,440
begin trying it out

142
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:24,639
so the next part of the website talks

143
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,520
about finding

144
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:29,039
and getting information um and then this

145
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:32,479
was a surprise to me

146
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:33,759
there's a map portal in it i in all my

147
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:35,758
years being near

148
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:37,520
it in the community i didn't realize it

149
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:40,479
actually had a map portal

150
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:42,960
is there anyone here ogc happy like do

151
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:44,880
they really love their standards

152
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:47,039
no one is willing to admit that one

153
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:50,320
person

154
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:52,719
have you heard of open web context

155
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:54,880
wow i was sure even a standards person

156
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:58,000
wouldn't have heard of that but

157
00:05:54,880 --> 00:06:00,400
we're not worthy uh so

158
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,759
these people uh the the geo network

159
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,000
folks actually

160
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:06,160
use ows contacts and standards for their

161
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,960
maps so if you build a map here

162
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,759
you can go and import it into a desktop

163
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,638
client

164
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:15,680
something else that supports ows context

165
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:15,680
i'm not sure what that is

166
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,359
but still we can now start to search

167
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,880
there's some kind of tag system

168
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,720
called facets which we can use to

169
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:27,360
quickly filter out the records

170
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:29,440
and we can do a text search all good

171
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,919
when we start to look at an individual

172
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:33,919
record it's actually really detailed

173
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:36,000
like this looks a lot more like a

174
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:38,560
professional catalog system

175
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,840
you know like in a library or something

176
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,520
um

177
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,198
except that it's got a whole bunch of

178
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,960
interesting things like maps and stuff

179
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:48,080
lurking in the corners

180
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:50,400
um the records contain a lot of detail

181
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:52,800
on the extent the source of data the

182
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:55,919
pedigree of it

183
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,680
and hopefully a download link or a link

184
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:59,680
to an actual web service where you can

185
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:02,319
grab the content

186
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,280
and then finally there's an add to map

187
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:05,360
button

188
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,318
right on the records so we can hit add

189
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,960
to a map and

190
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:09,520
see the data in a little browser here

191
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,280
and

192
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:13,919
as we're going through and do that we

193
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:16,400
can mix and match content we find

194
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:17,680
and eventually like download it when

195
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,799
we're done

196
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:23,840
so that was kind of fun so

197
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:26,319
out of the box for visitors geo network

198
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:28,000
is providing a really nice professional

199
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:29,919
catalog

200
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,759
people use it to manage you know

201
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:33,680
hundreds of thousands of records

202
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:35,680
and visitors search and browse for

203
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,599
content um

204
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,360
some of the content is stored directly

205
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:41,520
in the catalog like you can store

206
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:44,639
i don't know images and pdf reports and

207
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:47,120
stuff and then some of it is cataloging

208
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:48,879
external web services or external data

209
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:51,599
sets that's out there

210
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:53,199
and then geo network can also just be

211
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:54,000
used as a map portal there to actually

212
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:57,440
visualize

213
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:00,240
the content okay

214
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:01,680
breather here i don't i this this talks

215
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,960
not as long which is good because i have

216
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:07,280
less time

217
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:10,960
any questions about this core capability

218
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:12,400
no we're good okay

219
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,479
now we're going to pretend we're a data

220
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:16,400
custodian and we've got lots of

221
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:19,039
information we're responsible for is

222
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:22,000
there anyone like that in the room

223
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:23,919
couple people how many data sets do you

224
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,840
manage

225
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:27,840
12 1200

226
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:39,279
there's about 20 data sets okay

227
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:40,240
gotcha okay so the next part here is

228
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:42,559
about

229
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,480
editing and publishing your own records

230
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:45,439
and it also supports a whole whack of

231
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,040
standards

232
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:49,120
and it can manage both your data and

233
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,079
your documents one thing that's nice

234
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:53,040
about this

235
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:55,440
is that it does follow the ogc standards

236
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,800
you can have catalogs that harvest from

237
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,279
other catalogs and

238
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:01,839
bring up all this information and really

239
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:04,080
help with discovery

240
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:05,519
it's also relatively flexible for

241
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:08,080
configuration

242
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:09,680
security configuration got the idea of

243
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,279
harvesting from other catalogs

244
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:13,040
and they also have a lot of analysis

245
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:14,880
available on what

246
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:18,560
data sets and records are actually being

247
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,560
used which is very helpful

248
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:24,480
so why would you use one of these things

249
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,519
it helps your team find out what

250
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,040
information's

251
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:29,120
available in your organization do you

252
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,160
have like directories of shapefiles of

253
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,279
dubious limit

254
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:34,640
lineage how many duplicate data sets do

255
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:37,279
you have and so on

256
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:39,760
or perhaps you've got a government

257
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:41,680
obligation to share with the public

258
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,800
in europe the inspire program is really

259
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:47,760
popular for giving

260
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:49,359
people work to do for example

261
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,439
it also helps your team know where your

262
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:53,839
map came from so

263
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,440
what information is used behind the map

264
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:57,040
did you what information have you

265
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,800
purchased and maintained

266
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:01,120
it's almost embarrassing when two people

267
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,319
buy the same set of data

268
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,920
also what information are you

269
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,360
responsible for publishing to other

270
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:09,199
parties

271
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:09,600
okay so i can go through the steps here

272
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,000
of

273
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,040
pulling in some templates creating a new

274
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,959
record

275
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,399
in this case i have to choose the exact

276
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:22,640
like like

277
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:24,640
record structure so iso1919139

278
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,680
and then i can fill in the details and

279
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:29,199
this editor

280
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:30,399
is a thing of beauty is you can do all

281
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,800
the things these

282
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:34,079
standards are are very crazy or very

283
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,399
detailed

284
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:37,920
very detailed oriented and this editor

285
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:40,480
goes toe to toe

286
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:43,760
with how complicated these standards are

287
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,760
which is really impressive

288
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:49,040
and harvesting i just harvest from a

289
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:51,519
local geo server and i was able to

290
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:53,760
pull in some records and review the

291
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:55,360
records and and so on so harvesting

292
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:59,040
worked for me

293
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:01,360
so technical approach how does it work

294
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:03,199
developer friendly has got a whole bunch

295
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:05,760
of ability to customize it

296
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,720
and it really believes in open standards

297
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,760
open source

298
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:12,480
and opening all the things

299
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:13,760
here's my picture of it i'm not sure

300
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,480
anyone else has drawn a picture like

301
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:18,319
this

302
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:20,720
so the ui right now for

303
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:22,240
for geo network three is based on

304
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:25,200
angular and bootstrap

305
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,680
and a bit of open layers for the mapping

306
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:29,120
um

307
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:32,160
it's a java application so it's got

308
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:35,200
this picture i'm using jetty

309
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:36,160
the technologies are it's a spring based

310
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,720
application

311
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:40,480
it's using lucine for the text search if

312
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:43,680
you're searching lots of

313
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,399
like wfs feature content uh record by

314
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,599
record

315
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:50,240
and also use elastic search um

316
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,839
a couple interesting things here is it

317
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:54,720
does support the csw

318
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:56,399
protocol which allows it to interact

319
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:59,279
with other catalogs

320
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:02,079
and it does have a rest api and i see

321
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:05,760
people using the rest api about

322
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:08,959
50 50 versus the ogc standard

323
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:11,360
um and what else do we got

324
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:13,119
a whole bunch of it manages its own

325
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,279
users and groups internally

326
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:17,040
but it does interact with other

327
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:19,200
authentication systems

328
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:21,439
and a new feature is it does have a

329
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:24,000
publication workflow

330
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:25,600
so a record can be completed and then

331
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
given to someone else for review and

332
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:30,959
approval

333
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,399
okay yep lots of other things it does

334
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:35,199
make use of a database

335
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:37,440
to store its configuration this is

336
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:40,560
terrifying to me

337
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:42,720
i like little text files it's

338
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:44,638
as part of each upgrade there's a little

339
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,800
sql script to like update your

340
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:49,120
configuration table in the database

341
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:51,359
i'm really going to be terrified of like

342
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:53,440
changing those things

343
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,279
out of the box it works with h2 but one

344
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,200
of the first things people do is

345
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:59,279
switch it over to postgres or another

346
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:01,360
database when they go in production

347
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:03,439
and they're also starting to make use of

348
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:06,240
elasticsearch right now it's optional

349
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:08,639
but i think for geonetwork for it's

350
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:12,320
going to be a bit more mandatory

351
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:15,120
there it does is a file system there

352
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:18,480
to handle attachments and thumbnails and

353
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:21,519
a spatial index and so on

354
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:23,680
so it is a well-structured application

355
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:24,800
it's got really clear boundaries between

356
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,959
the server

357
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,959
and the front end and you see

358
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:29,680
organizations making use of this

359
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:32,079
division

360
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:33,760
so when we go and look at geo network

361
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:35,199
deployments people have completely

362
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:38,240
destroyed and made their own

363
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:41,680
front end from scratch or

364
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:44,399
made very extensive modifications

365
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:45,680
can also see some real evidence of

366
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:47,279
maturity so

367
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:49,279
organizations that are investing in the

368
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:50,320
code base and doing kind of major

369
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:54,160
architectural

370
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:55,760
changes and also you can swap out the

371
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:57,199
database you can swap out the data

372
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,800
directory for s3

373
00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:01,040
so some folks have put some thought into

374
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,040
this

375
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:07,519
really loves its xml technologies

376
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:09,440
so i expected validation that's fine

377
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:11,120
they also use schematron to put some

378
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,440
rules uh

379
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,240
uh in play and then they've got a

380
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,079
plug-in

381
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,760
for each standard and the plugin is

382
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:21,680
stored in a separate repository

383
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:24,880
to be kind of technology neutral

384
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:26,239
one thing that is was impressive as i

385
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:30,000
went into this

386
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:32,880
they actually use xslt to generate

387
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,079
that editor on the fly from the schema

388
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:36,079
document

389
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:38,319
so that's one reason why people are able

390
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:39,439
to adapt this for their own national

391
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,600
standard

392
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,800
so typically i see this being used to

393
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:46,000
generate html

394
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:49,359
or pdfs but dynamically making an editor

395
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,360
on the fly is a new one for me

396
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:57,199
to wrap up who makes it strong community

397
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:59,439
of companies and individuals

398
00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:01,439
osgo is the custodian so it's in a nice

399
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,440
vendor neutral

400
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,199
place it's also really nice to see

401
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:07,480
professional support

402
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:11,199
being offered and then actually seeing

403
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:15,680
acknowledgements of camp de camp geocat

404
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:18,800
and i can't pronounce it

405
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:21,359
okay i need to wrap up okay

406
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:23,040
here's an example of one where people

407
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,639
have made a new user interface they

408
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:28,000
actually added a shopping cart model

409
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:30,480
so go through and do a shopping cart

410
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,560
and here's a national registry here's

411
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:35,920
the original

412
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:37,758
united nations one this was the original

413
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:40,319
and so the open source in the name was a

414
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:43,759
feature this was the united nations

415
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:46,079
making their internal project an open

416
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:46,079
source

417
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:50,560
project so i really hope it pays off for

418
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:52,719
them because

419
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:54,000
all these years later there's companies

420
00:15:52,720 --> 00:16:07,600
the products been maintained

421
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:07,600
and so on so thank you
