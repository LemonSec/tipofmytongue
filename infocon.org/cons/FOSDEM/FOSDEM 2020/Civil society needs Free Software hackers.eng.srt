00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:09,759
hello everyone and welcome to foster

2
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:16,400
can you hear me in the back yes perfect

3
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:18,400
my name is matthias kushner i work for

4
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:20,880
free software foundation europe

5
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:23,119
and i'm here today to encourage you to

6
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,198
get active and support civil society

7
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:27,840
organizations

8
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:29,199
so nowadays computers are everywhere

9
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,399
around us

10
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:34,079
they are in the form of computers as

11
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,719
most of people know it

12
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,280
like desktop computers laptops mobile

13
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,640
phones

14
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:43,600
tablets or wi-fi routers

15
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,000
but they are also in shapes where people

16
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,879
usually

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,760
don't recognize them like for example

18
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:50,800
cars

19
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:54,079
trains airplanes washing machines

20
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:56,319
dishwashers lightning bulbs you name it

21
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:58,239
they are everywhere and they are

22
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,480
deciding what we can do

23
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:02,640
with those devices and what we cannot do

24
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,319
with those devices as a society

25
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,400
and when we don't understand how they

26
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:09,679
work we don't know

27
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,560
how our society works and sometimes they

28
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,760
are not even

29
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:16,400
around us but they are actually

30
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:18,240
directly attached to our body or even

31
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,119
inside of our body like with hearing

32
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,158
aids

33
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:25,360
or with defibrillators

34
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:27,920
so all those devices control

35
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:30,000
what people in a society can do or what

36
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,320
they cannot do

37
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,520
and are controlled thereby by the people

38
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,439
who develop them

39
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:38,640
who know the rules in there so there's a

40
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:38,639
huge difference in power

41
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,960
and nowadays more and more of processes

42
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:47,280
around

43
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:50,798
us are also shaped by software

44
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:54,079
here is an example in it's from france

45
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:56,399
in france a software decides which

46
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:59,119
pupils will be allowed to go to which

47
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:02,159
university

48
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:06,159
so this software was kept secret

49
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:08,959
for a long time and nobody knew

50
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:10,399
why some people were allowed to go to

51
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:13,120
one university

52
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:16,480
and some others might be uh might not be

53
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:19,280
allowed to go to university at all

54
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,000
so in that case a pupils organization

55
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,000
there

56
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,760
they sued the government and said they

57
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,760
want to have access to the source code

58
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,760
so they can see what is going on there

59
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:30,959
and there could be a debate

60
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:33,200
about if this is right or wrong

61
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:34,879
after some back and forth and uh that

62
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:38,000
they cannot publish the source code

63
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:40,640
because then it could be hacked

64
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,080
in the end they were successful and then

65
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:45,279
they could have a debate

66
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,879
about if those assumptions made in the

67
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,760
software and the rules implemented in

68
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:51,040
this software

69
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:54,160
if that's good for society it turned out

70
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:57,120
that pupils who live close

71
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:58,000
to university have a higher chance to be

72
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,879
admitted

73
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,200
to the university which in the case of

74
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:07,120
very prestigious universities

75
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:08,720
means that children from richer families

76
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,640
because the surroundings of those

77
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,400
prestigious universities usually have

78
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,559
very high rent rates

79
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,959
that they are more likely to be admitted

80
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,959
to one of those prestigious universities

81
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:20,000
which in turn also increases the

82
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,400
likelihood

83
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,120
that those children will have a better

84
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,480
paycheck

85
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:30,319
afterwards so it's very difficult for

86
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:32,480
pupils from lower income families to

87
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:34,159
change the income of the family in the

88
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,079
long run

89
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:37,359
and in this case they were able to do

90
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,200
this they

91
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,400
were able to have a discussion about

92
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,798
that and could

93
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,319
think about if this assumption which a

94
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:45,920
programmer made there oh it would be

95
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:47,679
nice if someone who lives close by

96
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,319
university has a higher chance to go

97
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,000
there

98
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:51,760
if this is something which is fair and

99
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,560
which is good for society or if it

100
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,560
should be changed

101
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,439
going from universities to job

102
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:03,120
applications

103
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:05,760
in the uk and the us a lot of the

104
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,560
job applications are filtered with

105
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,840
software

106
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:12,959
before any human will ever see them

107
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:16,079
so it's the software by a few companies

108
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:18,000
proprietary software by a few companies

109
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,600
which filters all of those shop

110
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,639
applications

111
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:24,720
and when you apply for a job

112
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:27,680
it might turn out you you will never be

113
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:30,000
invited to have a job interview

114
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,199
and people don't often know why this is

115
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,800
the case

116
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:34,960
there are court cases where sometimes

117
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:38,720
they find out some stuff

118
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:42,080
why this is the case but it's not clear

119
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:45,600
and so as as a

120
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:48,240
labor lawyer as unions um as

121
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,280
someone who who wants to find out why

122
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,520
you are not getting

123
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,320
invited to job interviews it's very

124
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,799
difficult

125
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,639
to have a debate in society if those

126
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,400
rules are right or wrong and if they are

127
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:02,000
discriminating people

128
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,000
when we don't want to discriminate them

129
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:07,280
going further almost all federal states

130
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,479
in the u.s

131
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:13,440
nowadays use the software to calculate

132
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:14,000
the likelihood of a criminal offender to

133
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:18,320
become

134
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:21,039
criminal again and this percentage

135
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:22,719
will then be considered by the judge for

136
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:25,039
some additional measures

137
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,639
and in some states they also say that

138
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:28,880
it's even considered for the length of

139
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:31,919
the sentence

140
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:34,479
how this software works and what factors

141
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:37,680
are exactly calculated in

142
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:41,599
for coming to this percentage number

143
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,720
that's not clear the defenders at the

144
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:46,160
the lawyers

145
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:49,840
they don't know what

146
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:52,160
factors are included in this and why

147
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:55,919
their client might have to go to jail a

148
00:05:52,160 --> 00:06:00,160
few years longer than someone else

149
00:05:55,919 --> 00:06:02,000
so in our society nowadays more and more

150
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,759
organizations more and more civil

151
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,720
society organizations

152
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:07,520
groups are affected by software and they

153
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,240
are affected

154
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:13,680
by not having the ability to understand

155
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:16,080
what the software is actually doing

156
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,000
they are not able to see what

157
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:20,159
assumptions were made by the people who

158
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,880
implemented the software

159
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,319
and that's a problem that they are not

160
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:26,240
able to do that

161
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:27,840
and they cannot fulfill their work which

162
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,680
they did before

163
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,919
or have more difficulties to fulfill

164
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,280
that and in future

165
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:35,680
there will be many many more

166
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:38,000
organizations in all kind of

167
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:40,880
areas in our society who will be

168
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,880
affected by that

169
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:45,600
in the case of the of the french pupils

170
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:48,080
association we saw that

171
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,680
people were asking for source code and

172
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,719
said that they would like to have access

173
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,880
and want to see

174
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,720
what the software is actually doing so

175
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,719
that they could have a debate in society

176
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,960
about that

177
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,400
there are too little people asking for

178
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,719
this i mean here

179
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:05,520
there is an example where i wouldn't

180
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:08,479
have expected it it's about dna analysis

181
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:10,000
software in forensics

182
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:11,919
and you read an article about how

183
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,560
horrible this situation there is and

184
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:14,318
that

185
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,720
this proprietary software which is used

186
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:17,360
there in some cases has almost 70

187
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,199
percent

188
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,199
failure rate to predict if that's really

189
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,639
the dna of a person

190
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:25,199
and if the person's going to jail

191
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:27,919
because of a false dna analysis

192
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:29,840
and they say well neither the experts

193
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:30,639
nor the defendants have access to the

194
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:33,119
source code

195
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:34,080
to see why this software is having this

196
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,919
those results

197
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:38,080
and why when you send it to another

198
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:40,880
laboratory you get another result

199
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:42,400
so that's not possible and in this case

200
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:45,919
someone asked about that

201
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:48,560
but we need more people more ss

202
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:49,599
more organizations to ask for access to

203
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,120
source code that there is more

204
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:52,560
transparency there that we can have

205
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,599
those debates

206
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:58,800
and you as free software hackers

207
00:07:55,599 --> 00:08:00,479
you have the tools for that you know how

208
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,680
to argue why it's important to have

209
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:03,919
access to software

210
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:06,319
to see what is actually going on there

211
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:08,400
what assumptions are made what ethics

212
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,759
are in and values are included in the

213
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:12,560
software so

214
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:14,800
you can argue about that you can also

215
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,960
explain them that in some areas

216
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:20,080
it's the default that you are able to

217
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:23,680
see what the software is actually doing

218
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:25,758
and you can also explain them that the

219
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,599
the argument that if a company is

220
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:29,919
publishing source code

221
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:31,199
that they then cease to exist that this

222
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:34,559
is not correct

223
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:37,360
and that it's a legitimate legitimate

224
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:38,799
question to ask for having access to

225
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,120
software and what this is doing

226
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:44,159
for certain institutions for people who

227
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:46,880
are affected by this

228
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:47,600
so lots of you care about different

229
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:50,240
values

230
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:52,240
about different courses some of you care

231
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,120
a lot about privacy some of you care a

232
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:58,320
lot about

233
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:58,320
animal rights public health about

234
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,640
different different aspects

235
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:06,080
environmental

236
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:08,640
regulations there are lots of

237
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:10,720
organizations working in those areas

238
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,319
and some of them they also work in a

239
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,000
direction when they are successful that

240
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,720
some other organizations

241
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,160
their goals will not be achieved that's

242
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,160
why it's important that

243
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:22,000
each one of you thinks about what is

244
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:24,319
important for you

245
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,519
and then supports this organizations

246
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,760
with your knowledge

247
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:29,360
and that they can better fulfill their

248
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,880
role there and help them to make

249
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:33,600
software freedom to default in their

250
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,600
area as well

251
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,320
it's important to know that software

252
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:41,760
freedom free software

253
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:42,320
issue in in all those uh topics where

254
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,160
these

255
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:46,320
civil society organizations are working

256
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:48,640
it's one small piece and a puzzle

257
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,240
there are many other things which should

258
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,040
which have to be considered i mean just

259
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:54,320
in the

260
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:57,599
uh in the it area you also

261
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:58,880
need people who argue why access to data

262
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:02,160
is important or

263
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:05,839
transparency of the hardware involved or

264
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:09,279
privacy issues are important so

265
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:11,200
but it's a very it's an important detail

266
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:12,959
in this puzzle free software is

267
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:16,560
necessary there it's not enough

268
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:17,680
but it's necessary so i would like to

269
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:21,119
encourage you

270
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:23,120
to get active there to reach out to

271
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,040
civil society organizations you care

272
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:27,200
about tell them

273
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,079
about free software that they are aware

274
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,480
about that

275
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:32,079
that there is the possibility to shape

276
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,800
the environment where they are working

277
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:36,479
in maybe help them to improve that free

278
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,439
free software software freedom becomes a

279
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,120
default there

280
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,880
so that the playing field they are

281
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,680
operating in is changing and is more

282
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:44,160
beneficial

283
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,880
for what they want to achieve there so

284
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:48,959
please

285
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:49,760
go out do this and it's in the end not

286
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:52,079
what

287
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:54,000
uh what one of us is doing there but

288
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:54,800
it's the sum of all of the activities we

289
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,560
are doing

290
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,319
and we are equipped with this knowledge

291
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:00,160
so please go out there and help those

292
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,680
organizations so that they can fulfill

293
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:05,040
their role for society

294
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:05,040
so thank you very much

295
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:15,120
and if you have any questions which we

296
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,599
cannot cover now i will be at the fsfe

297
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,160
booth

298
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,680
uh where this is it's over there i also

299
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:21,279
tomorrow at 12 have a

300
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,279
talk about the values of software

301
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:25,120
freedom beside that i would like to

302
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:26,800
thank all the donor supporters of the

303
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,480
fsfe who enable our work

304
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:30,560
so please also support our work for

305
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,720
software freedom and

306
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:34,800
now i would also like you to give a big

307
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,399
applause to the foster volunteers and

308
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,959
organizing team they are outside there

309
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:40,839
as well

310
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:43,839
to pick up laws for enabling this thank

311
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:43,839
you

312
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:56,079
thank you thank you

313
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:59,120
okay shall we take

314
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:59,120
or two questions or

315
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:11,839
there's one question over there i mean

316
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:11,839
yeah else just come to the fsne booth

317
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:27,519
then

318
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:31,279
hello um thank you for the talk

319
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:31,760
um so you you mentioned uh some cases

320
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:35,040
where

321
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,680
effectively software impacts on on lives

322
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,519
of people

323
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:39,279
and in ways that are terrible like for

324
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:42,320
example on the length

325
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:44,800
of uh of your sentence for example uh

326
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,160
but i was wondering whether which

327
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,719
whether the issue

328
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:49,439
might not be actually proprietary

329
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,959
software

330
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,720
rather than the adoption of property

331
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:53,439
software from the state because the

332
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,639
state

333
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:59,519
has got um some imperativity

334
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:00,800
on you i mean it uh it can oblige you to

335
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:03,760
do things

336
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:04,639
such as go to prison for example and if

337
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:08,399
that

338
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:10,880
is uh if that thing is

339
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:12,959
not based on something that we can all

340
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:15,120
agree upon for example

341
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:16,638
such as for example the source code i

342
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:20,000
see it i can see

343
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:22,800
what are the assumptions etc etc uh

344
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,920
then it's not obviously a good thing uh

345
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:27,040
so

346
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:30,399
is there maybe a creeper

347
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:32,560
in the i don't know i mean for

348
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:34,320
uh for software which is developed by

349
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:36,239
governments we are also running this

350
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:38,000
campaign public money public code

351
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,600
so we believe that when governments

352
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,600
public administrations are using

353
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,839
taxpayers money to develop software

354
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,440
that this should be free software and

355
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:46,720
that we should be able to see what this

356
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,480
software is actually doing that we

357
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:51,040
should be able to reuse that

358
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,920
but in the cases which i mentioned there

359
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,800
there's also

360
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,439
lots of software where the software is

361
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,359
actually

362
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,720
written by some companies who are then

363
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,399
controlling that and

364
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:03,920
even in those cases we should have a

365
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:04,320
debate which institution in our society

366
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,319
which

367
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,399
groups in our society should still have

368
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:10,639
access to this even it's not a direct

369
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:11,920
free software problem but they should

370
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:14,480
still have access

371
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:16,319
to to this software and see what is this

372
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,519
doing so we can have a debate in society

373
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:20,160
about that

374
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:21,920
and uh that's affecting lots of

375
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:24,639
organizations there

376
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:26,000
so i think it's both both there is

377
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:31,839
needed

378
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:31,839
thank you very much have a good fall sam
