2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:12,480
hey yay we've managed that because this

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:15,440
is the last session

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,960
the last talk say uh lightning talks um

5
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,119
we got um

6
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,640
this many uh volunteers here i'm very

7
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:23,519
glad to report

8
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,960
um so more or less all slots are filled

9
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:26,720
we're not probably not going to run this

10
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,680
until the very last second otherwise we

11
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,160
will get

12
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:31,119
kicked out violently so i thought

13
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,600
everybody got

14
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:35,200
eight minutes and then we will um 30

15
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,320
seconds before i will stand up and then

16
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,320
at eight minutes we will

17
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,360
friendly cut the people off with a round

18
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,960
of applause

19
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:45,920
and we start with olivier

20
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,559
thank you starson uh good night

21
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,840
everybody

22
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:59,839
i'm going to present the current

23
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:59,840
status of the help editor

24
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:09,520
okay so basically what we have is this

25
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:13,119
uh editor is

26
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:15,439
made for editing the xml

27
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:15,439
and

28
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,439
we we

29
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:27,200
i need my computer well okay

30
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,520
let's let's let's go base what we have

31
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,439
is

32
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:34,479
is essentially um this editor we can

33
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:38,158
open and choose a file of uh

34
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:40,640
uh of help to open i don't have any file

35
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:44,240
in this local computer so i can't

36
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:46,960
pick one you can also save it okay

37
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:48,000
but you also can start a document from

38
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:51,280
scratch

39
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,799
and we have set all these menus

40
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,119
to make some xml blocks so that it makes

41
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:58,640
it

42
00:01:55,119 --> 00:02:01,119
easier for us to edit

43
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,159
the contents of a file or to create a

44
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:05,600
new file

45
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:08,399
this case here i will start a new hxp

46
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,758
document it asks me just because i'm

47
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:12,879
going to clean

48
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:16,319
uh the editor and then i will have to

49
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:19,440
i will add some new things so i say okay

50
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:23,839
and it starts giving me

51
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:24,239
this xml which is exactly the start the

52
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,680
uh

53
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:30,400
the initial uh content of our next of an

54
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:33,040
help file you have the meta we have the

55
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:36,239
the help document we have all the tags

56
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:39,519
this editor here is code mirror

57
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:42,000
okay and with this code mirror we have

58
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:45,760
implemented not only the edition

59
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:49,360
but also several add-ons so i can

60
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:52,000
display use for example

61
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,280
the full screen editing we have a search

62
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,120
and replace

63
00:02:53,280 --> 00:03:00,080
feature we have

64
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,200
auto complete tags everything is

65
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,640
available for

66
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:07,839
making easy to edit

67
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:10,879
for example here i start my

68
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:14,239
my editing here in the body

69
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:14,720
if i want to add something i just click

70
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:17,840
here

71
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,640
for example and i want to make a title

72
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:22,080
so

73
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:26,798
i'm going to type whatever thing here

74
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,799
and then just a moment

75
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:36,000
then i select it here

76
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:39,120
and i format as a paragraph

77
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,560
or for example a heading such as

78
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:46,720
h1 it immediately

79
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:49,760
surrounds my my text by the proper

80
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:53,200
tag and it adds a specific

81
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:56,000
identification which uh is unique

82
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,439
inside the file so something that is

83
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,040
very cumbersome for

84
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:04,400
whoever edits the

85
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:06,720
help files in in libreoffice is to find

86
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,159
a new string for your unique

87
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:11,359
identification

88
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:14,480
and when i'm done i can

89
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:16,320
he come here with the tools and asked to

90
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:19,519
render the page

91
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:24,079
and okay

92
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:24,079
so we have resolution issues here

93
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:32,160
well it's it should have rendered the

94
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,160
page on the left

95
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,919
yeah we have a resolution issue here uh

96
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,159
it uh

97
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:41,039
the result of this page is displayed

98
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,479
here

99
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:47,840
and you can see exactly what you

100
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:50,639
are typing unfortunately it's not

101
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,638
working here

102
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,840
i don't okay

103
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:06,800
okay so here well yes

104
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,080
so here is the render page sorry it

105
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,479
should have been on the

106
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,840
on the on the right but then you have

107
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:14,240
your title here

108
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:16,479
and i have also implemented the

109
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:20,080
possibility to make a choice

110
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:21,520
uh you those who knows uh who edits

111
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,520
help files knows that there is

112
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:26,719
difference between the systems

113
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:30,240
and also difference between the modules

114
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:33,840
it's surrounded by this switching line

115
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:37,680
or switch tag that we use

116
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:40,719
and here is so here in the results

117
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:44,000
we have also other debug info

118
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:47,120
okay and also we have implemented

119
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,840
some uh some checkings

120
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:51,759
for example i want to check if the file

121
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:54,880
is

122
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:54,880
and it's

123
00:05:55,919 --> 00:06:01,120
it makes the validation so first of all

124
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:03,199
checks if the xml is correct so you have

125
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,319
open a tag and you have also closed the

126
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:06,479
tag

127
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:07,440
check with the xml document type

128
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:10,639
definition

129
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:11,120
to be to see if the dtd is correct and

130
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:14,160
also

131
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,120
check if there is a duplicate id in in

132
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,160
the file

133
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,800
okay so before you submit your your file

134
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,000
you can

135
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,880
run these checks and it will guarantee

136
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,240
that your phone

137
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:30,560
will be correct for the help the help

138
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,560
okay we have implemented other

139
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:39,840
other niceties such as

140
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:42,720
in the dock heating for example just to

141
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,719

174
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:38,880
click and add a table here

175
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:42,478
for example it it will generate

176
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:45,439
all the table for me

177
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:48,240
okay with all the structure and then i

178
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:51,600
feel the content of the table

179
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:54,880
and we plan to

180
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,600
one minute 30 seconds and we plan to

181
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:59,120
implement

182
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:01,839
uh not only to generate a patch

183
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:04,000
to be submitted to garrett and also

184
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:04,800
eventually to load the files directly

185
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,160
from

186
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:11,839
the master branch and

187
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:17,199
some uh help uh pages the

188
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:21,040
hhp reference uh that explained

189
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:23,839
okay yes so

190
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,839
you could have

191
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:45,439
hello my name is kisha and i'm libra

192
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:50,560
office developer and i'm working

193
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:54,320
in collaboration i will talk about the

194
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:57,920
improvic libreoffice in interrupt

195
00:09:54,320 --> 00:10:00,959
operability in libreoffice and

196
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:03,760
when we want to open a o xml

197
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:04,000
based document in libreoffice sometimes

198
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:08,160
we

199
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:11,440
can have some problems and to solve

200
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:15,519
them and first if

201
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:18,720
we have a bug report first reproduce to

202
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:23,279
we need report the bug

203
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:26,399
and second we simplify the

204
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:30,560
back document because we need to focus

205
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:33,839
on the problematic part and

206
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:37,599
we should do it step by step and

207
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:41,680
check it after every step the box still

208
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:43,920
there and if it's possible

209
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:45,359
we can we should create a bug from

210
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:48,640
scratch

211
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:51,440
and after uh

212
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,959
we should try it back in all the

213
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:56,399
libreoffice versions

214
00:10:52,959 --> 00:11:00,000
if there is no bug in other and older

215
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:03,440
versions in its regression

216
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:07,120
and we can use git bisect

217
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:07,120
to find guilty commits

218
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:16,719
the and the documents

219
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:19,839
all the odt and docx pptx

220
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:22,640
and these all uh documents it's

221
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:23,839
zip compressed device and when we open

222
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,880
it

223
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:30,560
in unzip and we can use read

224
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:34,160
xml files and

225
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:35,119
we can pick some clues from that xml

226
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:38,560
files

227
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,560
and the files

228
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:45,680
are unreadable but an examined

229
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:48,640
tool is corrects the

230
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,640
indentations

231
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:54,480
[Music]

232
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:58,000
if if it's possible to create

233
00:11:54,480 --> 00:12:01,200
a correct document and we can encompa

234
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,079
and compare a problem and problematic

235
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,279
and non

236
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:05,279
problematic files

237
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:12,320
to solve the bug the mod is

238
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:15,600
a great tool for this compression and

239
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,800
it has a nice vigilation and it allows

240
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:20,399
us

241
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:21,680
and compared the directories and after

242
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:25,120
that

243
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:28,959
when we pick up all the clues

244
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:32,160
and we should grab on the source code

245
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:34,560
and debug and try to fix it

246
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:36,639
i want to give an example and that i

247
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:40,000
sold before

248
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:43,600
in this back report we have a document

249
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:46,720
when we save in libreoffice and open

250
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:49,760
again we missed

251
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:52,959
three digits after the comma

252
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:56,160
in the chart level and

253
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:59,680
while i saw solving

254
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:04,240
first i reproduced back i saw

255
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:07,680
the bug i see i saw the bug is there

256
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:10,959
the simple the document was uh

257
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:14,638
enough simple and i tried

258
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:17,680
it with all the libreoffice but back

259
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:22,240
back was there and it is not

260
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:26,399
it was not a regression and four

261
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:26,399
i examine the

262
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:34,560
chart label in chart level properties in

263
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:37,040
microsoft office and i saw the person

264
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:40,160
the checkbox is checked

265
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:42,319
i looked for the corresponding feature

266
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:45,760
in libreoffice and i found it

267
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:50,160
and i i debug it

268
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:54,240
to learn how it works and after

269
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:58,560
i unzipped the file and

270
00:13:54,240 --> 00:14:02,560
i found a suspected attack

271
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:06,079
here the non-format format code

272
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:06,079
when i compare them

273
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:14,240
before and after the file

274
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:18,719
saving the file i saw the format code

275
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:21,920
missing in buggy file and

276
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:26,000
i read the related xml

277
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:30,719
specs and learn

278
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:33,760
what that tags it does

279
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:37,040
and i gripped and debug

280
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:40,639
var the external export

281
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:42,839
code and i found it and

282
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:44,000
and i have at the format called

283
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:47,920
attributes

284
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:51,760
in the new format okay attack

285
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:55,439
and i saw this all about is

286
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:58,240
picking some true key words

287
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,959
to graph in libreoffice the other part

288
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,360
is

289
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:03,680
your code reading skills and debug

290
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:06,800
skills

291
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:13,839
that's the patch that i

292
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:13,839
sent and that's all thank you

293
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:19,380
[Applause]

294
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:27,839
do we need this thing

295
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:43,839
okay

296
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,839
hello test test

297
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:48,240
okay i'm svante schubert pleased to meet

298
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:50,560
you

299
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:52,480
while he's looking up i'm i'm going to

300
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,920
give you a disruption warning now a 10

301
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,440
minute disruption warning i wasn't sure

302
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:57,920
if it's three minutes or four or

303
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,440
five minutes so i only got 10 slides i

304
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:04,399
would have taken more

305
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:06,839
so um while he's trying to find

306
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:09,839
yeah just found scrambled should be

307
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:09,839
possible

308
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:16,319
windows i believe oh no few

309
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,320
sorry

310
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,279
great hello

311
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:26,959
so this could be libreoffice and i hope

312
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:30,320
it won't become libreoffice

313
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:32,880
so i give now fair enough a very

314
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:34,160
short disruption warning disruptive in

315
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:36,959
the sense of

316
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,920
just second do i use this one yeah um in

317
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:40,160
the sense of

318
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:41,120
um disrupt this feature i have in mind

319
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,639
like in nokia

320
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:45,120
one of the leaders i love my nokia

321
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:46,000
phones i was was very proud of my nokia

322
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,759
phones

323
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,600
but then the smartphone came and they

324
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:51,600
were gone right so

325
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:54,079
i'm proud to be here with libreoffice

326
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:56,959
and i don't want that it happens again

327
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:57,680
so what kind of disruption might happen

328
00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:00,880
there so

329
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:02,880
we have in the tdf um a new toolkit more

330
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:05,520
or less new it started with sun at

331
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:06,880
the beginning of 2000s and we put all

332
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,319
the java source code we have to

333
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:11,360
manipulate odf

334
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:14,559
documents and it went from

335
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:17,678
apache now to ddf and was forked by

336
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:21,439
um by the open exchange

337
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:23,919
for their back end and i merged it back

338
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:25,439
and soon you see there's a snapshot one

339
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:28,400
zero zero this feature will be

340
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:30,880
integrated and this is all wait a minute

341
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:35,200
how can i do this

342
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:37,840
okay just a second try to

343
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,880
oh yeah it is wonderful all right so

344
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:41,918
that's very simple

345
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,720
so are we doing now it's just a green

346
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:44,880
box here

347
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,880
not a black box because open source so

348
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,520
we drop in the text document and it

349
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,840
becomes

350
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,879
um totally equivalent sequence of user

351
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,879
changes so

352
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:55,280
we're entering now the real move changes

353
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,480
here and you can merge new changes back

354
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,639
why we're doing this

355
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,840
because we don't wanna as a software

356
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,679
developer zip our source code

357
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,639
repositories and then send them to other

358
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:05,440
developers

359
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,480
um if we share our work all we want to

360
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:09,360
do we want to

361
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:10,559
dispatch commits this changes so we are

362
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:13,039
able to merge them back

363
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:14,879
but it's impossible we have zipped xml

364
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:16,960
and these are like repositories

365
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,240
and we need to come down to changes to

366
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,320
really do collaboration

367
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,760
like in asynchronous offline

368
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:24,879
collaboration where we can

369
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:25,840
um where we can work together in a more

370
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:29,200
comfortable way

371
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:30,959
and this is becoming actually a feature

372
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,320
and i'm going to document now i'm just

373
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,960
documenting this all the way to doing

374
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,879
now

375
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,559
so in the end i would love to

376
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,520
standardize even the changes so not only

377
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:39,280
the full zip

378
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:40,720
repository is being changed but there's

379
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:42,879
some odf change

380
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:44,240
and you see um it doesn't matter how we

381
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:46,080
serialize it it's

382
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,600
the user knowledge of these things the

383
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,960
entities when i phone you about my

384
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:51,039
change and it's gonna call you

385
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:53,120
hey by the way in the third paragraph

386
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:54,879
the second letter please delete it okay

387
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:56,639
if you if you follow my mom she doesn't

388
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,240
know anything on odf or so but but she's

389
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,760
sitting in a from libra office and you

390
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:01,280
tell her there's the table there's the

391
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,080
image then there's a paragraph and this

392
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:04,639
paragraph

393
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:06,480
go to number um now make the third

394
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:08,400
character the fifth police bolt

395
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:10,160
and that's the way we we go to the

396
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,679
semantic level with stable

397
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:14,400
and we are going to standardize these

398
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:16,240
semantic entities and set them around

399
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,679
so in the end we do a fine collaboration

400
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:20,240
here so

401
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:21,760
why is it cool what can we do now so we

402
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:23,679
are first extended

403
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:25,360
we know as long as sending repositories

404
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:28,160
we're going to send changes right

405
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:29,840
so we might be as github we can say

406
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:32,000
there's some famous author now having

407
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:33,678
his book outside and he doesn't want to

408
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,280
get copies because it's a very huge book

409
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:38,000
but you can send a gif

410
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:38,799
sorry a github pull request saying oh by

411
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,039
the way this

412
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:42,799
1 000 countable thing that's being a

413
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:44,480
paragraph there's a typo please delete

414
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:46,000
it and you can take just to take a look

415
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,559
at this tiny thing and change and you

416
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,120
can say oh

417
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:50,000
cool i merge it there's no bad jokes in

418
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:52,000
this uh

419
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,039
copy he might receive so it's very easy

420
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,280
and very comfortable

421
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:56,879
and of course um version systems like

422
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:58,799
git currently there are only

423
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,720
line based and uh there's only binary

424
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:01,280
file but if we go to abstract semantic

425
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:04,159
level

426
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:05,280
then we we can say um what are the

427
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:07,200
difference between two

428
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,960
versions of this uh contract for

429
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:11,440
instance and somebody say

430
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:13,200
okay we just return these changes we

431
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,799
just defined and you say oh

432
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,320
um and the third there's a new third

433
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:16,879
paragraph and the fifth one we've

434
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:20,080
deleted

435
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:23,440
okay so we can come to a new level

436
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:24,799
of um collaboration and handling with

437
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,799
documents right

438
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:27,918
and i think one of the most powerful

439
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:30,240
things is that

440
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:33,120
these changes already exist among

441
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:35,039
multiple not only odf applications but

442
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:36,479
in html there are paragraphs as well and

443
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:38,879
there's bold italic and

444
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:40,720
tables and they do the same operations

445
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:44,240
like insert a row into the column

446
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:46,240
and you can even load an odf document a

447
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:49,120
full feature document in a vi

448
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,840
in text document emacs by simply saying

449
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:52,639
every line

450
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:53,520
is a paragraph and there's text and we

451
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:56,400
just receive

452
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,879
from all these changes um these changes

453
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,679
that are

454
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:01,039
about paragraphs and tables and align

455
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:03,600
reorder the positions

456
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:04,240
to addition in the editor doing uh

457
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,320
additions

458
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,760
and then we merge these changes back and

459
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:09,840
filling all these features that are

460
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:12,000
where are known earlier back in so we

461
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:13,520
are merging changes back and not

462
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,200
like we always do with the floppy disk

463
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:18,400
load everything safely thing

464
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:19,919
so when you ever edit it with

465
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:22,080
libreoffice word

466
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:24,000
a very huge document and you make a

467
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:25,199
small change and say oh i better save i

468
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,200
don't want to lose it then

469
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,640
waiting everything everything is being

470
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,960
saved doesn't matter it doesn't have to

471
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,640
do

472
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,080
because all you have to do now is to

473
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:34,080
save only the change

474
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:36,000
or just to merge it back so it's

475
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:38,240
becoming much much more faster

476
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,919
and if we all got copies of documents

477
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:42,159
and you give me back your changes or

478
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:43,600
a single change i don't have to look at

479
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:45,760
all the documents and pass them

480
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:47,760
i just take the changes each one and put

481
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:49,679
them together yes compare these changes

482
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:51,440
so the the merge is no longer dependent

483
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:52,480
on the on the size of the document but

484
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:55,520
the amount of changes

485
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:57,600
all right so

486
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:59,440
and so we have a different level of

487
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:01,918
interability and um

488
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,960
we'll see how it's going to um and why

489
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:04,880
we are in danger

490
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:07,280
because it's very hard to implement in

491
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:09,360
the libreoffice um

492
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:10,879
people are not customers not demanding

493
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:13,039
it because it's they don't aware that

494
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:15,919
that's possible and it's very hard

495
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:18,400
uh i heard from developers to imple

496
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:20,000
implement it in a way that's being um

497
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,440
that you see something like i asked

498
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,360
michael stahl what he needs

499
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,559
and he said i need a time machine

500
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:26,799
because the design

501
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:28,960
what was chosen the 80th was totally

502
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:30,480
different from floppities no internet

503
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,600
to the current days were always the

504
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:33,039
internet and we're collaborating with

505
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:36,480
ourselves all the time

506
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:38,400
and so if

507
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:41,200
there's no danger yet right there's only

508
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:43,120
this tiny back-end tool not front-end

509
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,480
nobody is aware of this feature maybe

510
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:47,520
you are but

511
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:48,080
um no user knows it but if others taking

512
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:51,280
this up

513
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:53,918
and building let's say like cak 8.5

514
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:57,360
which have changes in their model

515
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:58,159
by design losing this to using this to

516
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:01,600
load and

517
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:04,240
edit um office documents

518
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:06,399
with odf and embracing git then it's

519
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:07,520
becoming very very powerful and then we

520
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:10,960
are in a danger

521
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:13,760
so what i'm suggesting here is

522
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,400
that we are no sorry that was an old

523
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,240
slide

524
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,600
we are we are we are really implementing

525
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:20,080
it right we

526
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:21,520
and if we are not doing it then i think

527
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:24,720
the document foundation

528
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:26,559
if should take care of and

529
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:28,000
it's not for me because i'm not actually

530
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:31,520
coding in libreoffice

531
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:35,520
but i think it's important that we have

532
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:51,840
this in our

533
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:51,840
view okay thank you for listening

534
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:05,840
hdmi is on

535
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,840
yep

536
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:30,559
now my talk is about bin bags

537
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:32,240
not really um but the foster organizers

538
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:33,840
came in before so sorry for a bit of

539
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:35,440
disturbance during your talk but they

540
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:37,360
said if we have any rubbish

541
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,320
left uh we need to collect it together

542
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,678
so if you've got anything you don't want

543
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,960
to take with you tonight

544
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:43,200
we'll just put it all in the bin bag

545
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,480
here yeah close the windows and

546
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,600
because you know i think they're all

547
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,480
working voluntary and they're doing the

548
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:49,360
best they can so

549
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:50,720
we'll leave that there now um one of the

550
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:53,439
biggest problems we have

551
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:54,960
in an open source project is um

552
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:58,000
crediting contributors

553
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:59,200
and making them feel um uh

554
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,799
showing that we're really grateful for

555
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,559
everything they do obviously we can

556
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:04,720
invite them to conferences

557
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:06,320
uh we can send them stickers and small

558
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:08,240
merchandise and gifts like that as well

559
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:10,559
but what are some other ways

560
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:11,840
how can we say thank you and make them

561
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:14,639
feel really

562
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:16,000
um appreciated and one way is with open

563
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:18,960
badges that some of you

564
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,960
may have heard of before so this is the

565
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:23,279
super short description open badges

566
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:24,799
verifiable portable digital badges with

567
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:26,720
embedded metadata about skills and

568
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:30,400
achievements so these are

569
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:33,039
png images with metadata inside

570
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:34,080
to um show what somebody has done why

571
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:37,279
they are awesome

572
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:38,960
uh as well um the fedora project uses

573
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:40,840
them i'll show you in a second

574
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:42,799
um good way to show appreciation to

575
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:44,559
contributors and

576
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:45,918
it's hosted it's its own open source

577
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:49,120
project here's how

578
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:52,080
fedora does it so these are all

579
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:53,360
people in the fedora project active all

580
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:55,120
their usernames

581
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:56,559
and when they hit a certain milestone

582
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:58,639
when they've done something

583
00:25:56,559 --> 00:26:00,480
they get a badge they have lots of

584
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,279
automated systems set up for this as

585
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,960
well

586
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:04,640
and they they make it into a sort of

587
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,360
friendly competition between people in

588
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:08,960
the community

589
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:12,399
so if you've done 150

590
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:14,240
git commits or wiki edits or 150 some

591
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:17,360
things you get a certain batch

592
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:18,720
as well so and then they show who's

593
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:20,240
leading in the week who's leading in the

594
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,520
month they gather all the information

595
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,640
from all the different activity in the

596
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:25,440
fedora project

597
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:27,679
and then they give these badges now you

598
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:29,039
can decide you can define

599
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:31,120
what these levels are what these

600
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:32,480
thresholds are it can be for the first

601
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:34,399
time somebody commits

602
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:35,840
actually gets their patch committed to

603
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,559
the libreoffice source code tree they

604
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:38,799
get a batch

605
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:41,279
as well you know cool we can decide all

606
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:41,279
that as well

607
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:44,960
so slightly boring technical stuff but

608
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:47,679
the badges

609
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:49,039
are defined by json files as well so

610
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:51,520
just involves

611
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:52,320
poking around in those three files the

612
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,760
issuer which

613
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:56,879
in this case is us libreoffice the

614
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:59,279
document foundation the badge class that

615
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:01,840
defines the type of award we want to

616
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:04,880
give so maybe for 100 wiki edits

617
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:05,439
or for 10 code commits a thousand

618
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:07,520
questions

619
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:09,120
answered on ask libreoffice our user

620
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:10,639
assistant website for instance

621
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:12,959
and then this json file that's very

622
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:16,240
specific for the person who gets

623
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:17,120
the uh gets the badge so here's an

624
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,960
example

625
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:20,559
again not super exciting but just so you

626
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:24,080
can see

627
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:25,918
this is who gets the badge this is

628
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:27,760
when it was issued but this is very

629
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:29,679
important as well this um

630
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:30,960
this is super important this verified

631
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:33,039
thing because

632
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:34,320
when we issue a badge and if somebody

633
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:35,679
wants to show off that they have a

634
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,799
really nice badge from the document

635
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:39,279
foundation that they've

636
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:40,559
written 20 code patches or answered 500

637
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:43,440
questions

638
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:44,720
with this it can be verified that we

639
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,480
issued the badge

640
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:48,799
so it's not just somebody has opened a

641
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:50,640
png image in a hex editor and poked all

642
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:52,320
this data inside

643
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:54,159
and this isn't this is good when people

644
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:57,760
really want to show off their badges for

645
00:27:54,159 --> 00:28:00,480
future um work opportunities as well

646
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:02,480
so to say i've got a i've contributed a

647
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:03,840
lot to a big project like libreoffice

648
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:06,000
and i want to show that i want to put it

649
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:08,559
on my linkedin profile or

650
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,320
social media it's not just a little

651
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:10,960
cutesy thing that they're given but

652
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:14,080
actually like

653
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:15,440
this is real stuff that the libreoffice

654
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:18,559
project has shown they appreciate what

655
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:20,640
i'm doing and i've contributed enough so

656
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:22,240
we have a couple of badge designs thanks

657
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:25,120
to our community as well

658
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:26,559
um i quite like this one personally

659
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,678
because i think it's quite quirky and

660
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:29,360
fun

661
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:31,840
but if again if people want to show them

662
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:33,760
off on their on their linkedin profiles

663
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:35,439
and they really want to use it to to

664
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:36,960
further their job opportunities

665
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:38,720
then something like this may be better

666
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:41,600
so we'll have a bit of a discussion

667
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:42,399
in the design community maybe use both

668
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,959
let's see

669
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:45,520
but we have this working the tooling is

670
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:49,039
set up

671
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:51,039
as well um so the plan is now let's go

672
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:52,640
ahead and do it so

673
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:54,559
after in the next few days after

674
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,200
fostering we can start giving badges to

675
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:59,039
people

676
00:28:55,200 --> 00:29:00,960
for their work we can thanks to

677
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:02,640
gillem and the infrastructure team as

678
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:04,320
well we can get lots of statistics from

679
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,279
different services and tools in the

680
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:07,840
project

681
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:09,679
so we can run commands to see who has

682
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:11,760
answered 500 questions on ask

683
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:14,720
libreoffice who has made

684
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:16,320
500 wiki commits whatever code commits

685
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:18,240
as well i think even

686
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:21,678
bug reports this there are a few other

687
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:24,000
things we can do gather the data

688
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:26,080
my plan is to initially give badges to

689
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,520
people personally so to generate a badge

690
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:30,559
and then email somebody

691
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:32,000
and say with a personal thanks for for

692
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:34,799
your contributions

693
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,279
um so to start off a bit smaller but

694
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:36,799
with a

695
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:38,799
sort of customized message the way the

696
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:40,960
fedora guys do it which is cool

697
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:42,320
is it's all done automatically in this

698
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:44,640
nice system

699
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:46,480
maybe we can go to that as well we can

700
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:47,279
aggregate lots of data and issue the

701
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:49,360
badges

702
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:51,200
automatically but i think at the start i

703
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:52,320
want to send them to people and say

704
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:54,399
thanks a lot you know we really

705
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:55,360
appreciate it here's something it's not

706
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:57,678
just a nice

707
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:59,840
shiny png image but this has data that

708
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:04,080
you can then show to a potential

709
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:06,559
employer um yep so that's the plan

710
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:08,158
um do it personally for now and then

711
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:10,158
automate it later

712
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:12,399
um then maybe some of you will be

713
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:14,080
receiving badges from me soon as well

714
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:16,239
so and then you can open them up in a

715
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:17,918
hex editor and check that they're real

716
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:23,840
that's the back and i think that's it

717
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:23,840
yep was that eight minutes

718
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:40,239
okay uh it shouldn't be like a new

719
00:30:38,679 --> 00:30:43,440
design.org but hub

720
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:46,720
uh slash badges slash

721
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:48,240
whatever which redirects

722
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,440
okay sure yeah we're just using new

723
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:51,840
design at the moment for testing

724
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,840
purposes

725
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:58,799
that's a good point i'll make a note for

726
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:58,799
when we implement it live yeah thanks

727
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:05,840
okay

728
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:19,840
most probably it won't but we'll see

729
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:39,760
so um let me just introduce myself

730
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:43,039
um i have a fancy

731
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:45,600
app here and a fancy device

732
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:47,279
and i would like to show you what we did

733
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:50,719
in the last couple of months

734
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:52,240
so my name is nicholas i work for ad

735
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:55,200
finishes with

736
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:57,039
free and open source service provider

737
00:31:55,200 --> 00:32:00,399
and i will become a deputy

738
00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:03,120
board of directors for the dtf soon

739
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:04,559
you can also follow me on twitter where

740
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:07,678
i use the

741
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:12,000
nexlore twitter

742
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:15,360
name so what you can see here now is

743
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:19,039
libroff is more or less running on um

744
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:21,678
natively on an ipad um i would like to

745
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:22,720
explain a little bit what we did here so

746
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:25,440
this is not

747
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:26,159
um online so i can actually disable

748
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:29,600
wi-fi

749
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:32,720
and everything will work as it should

750
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:34,000
so the app is um using the same code

751
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:37,519
base as

752
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,640
libreoffice online does and it's also

753
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:41,120
the same as we

754
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:43,200
we are using on android and candy showed

755
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:45,039
it

756
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:47,840
this afternoon as well and i would like

757
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:50,559
to show you a couple of um

758
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:52,080
things that we can do with the app so if

759
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:52,639
you open the app what you actually see

760
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:56,000
is the

761
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:57,039
the native ios file manager and i

762
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,399
prepared a couple of

763
00:32:57,039 --> 00:33:02,960
files just to show you um a couple of

764
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:05,518
easy things so let's start with the text

765
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:05,519
document

766
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:11,840
there you can see that it's

767
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:14,480
more or less the same uh use user

768
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:17,600
interface as we have in in online

769
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:18,080
but we have some um things that you can

770
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:20,320
do

771
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:22,960
um using the native functions that are

772
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:27,600
your sprite so for example i can use the

773
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:30,960
emoji keyboard to add some emojis

774
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:32,879
or um i can copy and paste

775
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:34,640
pictures from from the browser for

776
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:37,120
example so if i have

777
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:38,399
this little animal here oh okay yeah so

778
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:41,600
the browser is offline

779
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:43,600
now as well but um let's just connect

780
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:45,918
to the wi-fi again um i can copy and

781
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:48,959
paste pictures um from other

782
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:52,480
applications to to the app as well

783
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:54,640
um we can use um things

784
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:56,159
with the finger so you cannot see that i

785
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:57,360
touch the screen by them if i want to

786
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:58,960
resize

787
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:00,799
the table i can actually do that with

788
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:04,480
with my finger i can also

789
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:07,519
just tap on one of the gray areas around

790
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:09,918
the table to select things and make them

791
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:13,199
bold for example

792
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:15,040
we also have quite big handles around

793
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:16,960
the picture to just resize them with the

794
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:20,639
finger you can also

795
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:22,240
rotate them and you also have the

796
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:24,000
sidebar for example um

797
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:25,439
which you already know from from the

798
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:28,000
desktop version

799
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:28,560
um and there you can also see that we

800
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,760
have

801
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:35,839
quite big widgets to just

802
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:35,839
use them with the finger as well

803
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:44,079
what i also especially like is if we use

804
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:44,719
the spreadsheet component you can

805
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:47,599
actually

806
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:48,399
use the hardware keyboard that was not

807
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:51,839
possible

808
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:54,960
until i think ios 13 or something

809
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:56,560
so now if you um want to select the cell

810
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:58,320
range you can do it with the handles as

811
00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:00,240
well but sometimes you just want to use

812
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:02,720
the keyboard so you can just use

813
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:03,598
the usual um shortcuts like shift and

814
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:06,319
then

815
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:07,680
um just use the arrow keys on the

816
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:10,480
keyboard as well

817
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:12,799
same also works for formulas so if you

818
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:16,640
start to write the formula

819
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:18,960
and then you can use the um

820
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:20,640
the hardware keys to actually select the

821
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:24,320
range as well

822
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:25,839
and do things like that you can also

823
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:29,040
just then

824
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:33,040
select the range of cells insert

825
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:34,880
a diagram and

826
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:36,960
these things will also update so if i

827
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:40,480
just use a

828
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:42,079
much bigger number here you will see

829
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:45,760
that

830
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:48,640
the diagram will change and um

831
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:50,240
this all works natively or like you

832
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:53,520
don't need an internet connection

833
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:56,720
and we can also have a look at

834
00:35:53,520 --> 00:36:00,400
the empress part so um there's a

835
00:35:56,720 --> 00:36:04,240
slide deck that i prepared and

836
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:07,680
of course we can can edit things here

837
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:12,000
um change text and then

838
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:15,759
start the slideshow navigate to

839
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:19,520
those slides have um charts

840
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:22,640
here as well and then

841
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:23,440
you can um edit everything as you would

842
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:26,640
expect

843
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:28,160
um there of course are still a number of

844
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:31,200
things that don't work

845
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:32,399
um it's still work in progress um but i

846
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:35,439
think the

847
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:38,480
next um release the 4.2 release

848
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:42,160
should bring quite a bit of um

849
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:45,599
these nice new features one thing that i

850
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:48,078
also would like to show is the dialogues

851
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:49,440
the native dialogues

852
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:52,240
that you should know from from

853
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:55,760
libreoffice they look a bit

854
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:56,879
like ios native dialogues with those

855
00:36:55,760 --> 00:37:01,520
green

856
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:03,359
switches and um yeah

857
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:05,040
things that are big enough to actually

858
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:08,160
use with the finger

859
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:08,960
so that's more or less what i would like

860
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:11,279
to show you can

861
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:13,200
download it from the store from the

862
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,760
apple store i have it somewhere open

863
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:17,040
it's

864
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:20,320
um right now

865
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:22,480
you can use the colabora build and

866
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:24,720
i would like like to censor thanks also

867
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:26,720
the the developers from collabora

868
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:28,160
for their support for the heavy invest

869
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:32,480
they uh did

870
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:35,200
and um it's fair to um give them a

871
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:36,000
uh shorter plows or pay them a beer

872
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:38,240
later on so

873
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,680
if you use collaborative office the

874
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:42,879
search term you should find

875
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:44,399
the version right now it's 4.1 that you

876
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:47,520
can find but i think you should

877
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:48,400
get 4.2 through test flight and also as

878
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:51,119
a final building

879
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:52,240
in a couple of weeks i hope that's it

880
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:53,610
thank you very much

881
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:57,930
any questions

882
00:37:53,610 --> 00:38:00,160
[Applause]

883
00:37:57,930 --> 00:38:05,839
[Music]

884
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:05,839
no questions good thank you

885
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:36,000
okay so it's me so i'm cheating a little

886
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,960
bit so it's um what i'm talking about

887
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:40,880
it's not going to be

888
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:42,720
um about um libreoffice for a change

889
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:46,480
um but it's about something that i care

890
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:50,480
a lot about which is a digital workflows

891
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:54,480
so i was hacking a bit

892
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:57,680
with boobly on something that

893
00:38:54,480 --> 00:39:01,119
many of you might know which is

894
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:04,319
poplar and ocular which is some

895
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:04,320
one of the more

896
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:12,839
more popular pdf viewers on

897
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:16,640
on free operating systems

898
00:39:12,839 --> 00:39:17,920
so since this is uh not a native linux

899
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:21,200
i'm just gonna

900
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:25,119
play some um screencasts i must say

901
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:27,839
uh i was doing so the problem um that um

902
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:29,359
rises obviously these days is that you

903
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:33,119
that you want to sign

904
00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:33,680
um documents digitally not not printed

905
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:36,240
out and

906
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:39,200
paper and then scan it again so that

907
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:41,118
that's a feature that's broadly missing

908
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:42,240
except for libreoffice so libreoffice

909
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:43,680
can do that

910
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:45,118
but there might be documents that you're

911
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:46,240
not generating in libreoffice so what

912
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:49,440
you're going to do

913
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:50,959
um so well this document is generated

914
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:55,520
now in libreoffice um but

915
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:58,560
um what i'll show you now in a moment

916
00:39:55,520 --> 00:40:01,759
while i'm trying to save that down

917
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:04,640
is that so that there's two patches um

918
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:06,400
two merch requests one for poplar that's

919
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:08,240
more or less

920
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:09,680
building on something that someone did

921
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:12,078
four years ago

922
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:13,279
which started that and then um i took

923
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:16,400
quite a bit of code

924
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:17,599
from libreoffice um that was done i

925
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:20,160
think but

926
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:22,960
with this crowdfunding from this uh

927
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:25,598
willem talks project i've got this

928
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:27,040
partis pardess extension so that's like

929
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:29,920
time stamping authority

930
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:32,000
and other nice nice things and put that

931
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:35,440
into poplar which is um the the let's

932
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:39,040
say the low level pdf

933
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:42,400
reader and renderer and then added

934
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:44,000
as a bit of ui on top um which no no

935
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,800
that's not me that was bubbly but i was

936
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,520
kind of

937
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:48,800
just doing the finishing touches in the

938
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:52,640
last

939
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:54,480
few weeks um so while this is

940
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:56,879
building i wonder if i can just forward

941
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:59,119
that it's getting a bit boring

942
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:59,119
um

943
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:08,319
so yeah let me let me just ramble on so

944
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:08,319
um

945
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:12,720
right so um actually i think i skipped

946
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:17,440
too far

947
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:21,118
um so that's the um the actual document

948
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:24,240
that was signed already

949
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:26,960
unfortunately i can't

950
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:27,919
there's no key frames there so it always

951
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:30,640
has to oh yeah

952
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:31,839
there we go so that's the the generated

953
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:35,040
document with the

954
00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:38,240
signature stamp and the party's

955
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:40,560
stamp of approval there in libreoffice

956
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:41,919
i should probably scroll back a bit

957
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:45,279
further

958
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:47,359
so that you can actually see that it's

959
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:48,960
ocular doing that

960
00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:50,480
and then the workflow is essentially

961
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:53,920
like like an um

962
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:56,160
um and an acrobat or other so you just

963
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:56,160
um

964
00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:03,839
yeah you you open some you draw some

965
00:42:00,839 --> 00:42:03,839
rectangle

966
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:09,920
okay there we go so that's the document

967
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:11,440
you pre you bump the sign button

968
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:13,040
you draw a rectangle where you want to

969
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:16,480
put the signature

970
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:21,040
um you select your your certificate

971
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:22,720
you sign it eventually i will do that

972
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:26,319
there

973
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:28,640
right so

974
00:42:26,319 --> 00:42:30,640
that pulls the like like libreoffice as

975
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:34,078
well pulls that out of the

976
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:36,720
nss defaulting to firefox configurable

977
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:36,720
keystore

978
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:45,839
and then eventually

979
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:50,480
select that yes come on

980
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:55,839
okay and then saves that and reloads

981
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:59,520
that and

982
00:42:55,839 --> 00:43:01,920
um it's all down

983
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:02,880
okay so this is um right now this is in

984
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:06,000
review

985
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:08,800
the idea really is um to have um

986
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,839
with pure open source to have the

987
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:12,880
complete

988
00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:14,560
set of tools that you need for a fully

989
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:16,240
digital workflow

990
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:18,400
where you don't need any proprietary

991
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:21,439
software anymore you don't need to go

992
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:24,480
and and have clumsy workarounds or worse

993
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:27,119
printed to paper so

994
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:28,480
and yes there it is okay i bought you

995
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:31,280
enough

996
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:32,400
um let's pause that for the moment any

997
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:35,359
comments questions

998
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:35,359
you have a bit of time

999
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:41,839
great thanks

1000
00:43:52,839 --> 00:43:55,839
so

1001
00:44:06,839 --> 00:44:09,839
this

1002
00:44:25,839 --> 00:44:37,839
you don't see anything

1003
00:45:02,839 --> 00:45:05,839
so

1004
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:19,839
um

1005
00:45:30,839 --> 00:45:36,400
so

1006
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:37,680
all right uh you've seen a lot of very

1007
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:40,720
professional called uh

1008
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:44,399
talks in this lightning talk session and

1009
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:44,399
even one with the linkedin linked

1010
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:50,240
in the early days of libreoffice it was

1011
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:52,720
a little bit more cowboy so who

1012
00:45:50,240 --> 00:46:00,640
who knows what will happen if i press

1013
00:45:52,720 --> 00:46:04,879
return here

1014
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:08,160
right it takes some time but uh

1015
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:12,400
after that my slow ssd should find that

1016
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:13,520
uh this hasn't been optimized from 1989

1017
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:15,920
till

1018
