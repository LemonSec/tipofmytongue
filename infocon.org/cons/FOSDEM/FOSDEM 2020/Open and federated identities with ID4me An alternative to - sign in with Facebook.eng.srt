1
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:10,960
hello everyone

2
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:12,960
so i thank you for coming i'm with sorry

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,080
about all i'm here to present the id4me

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,600
project for

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:20,960
open and federated identities

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:23,760
so as soon as we get back to

7
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,760
presentation but

8
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:29,278
okay so i mean i think

9
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,720
everyone already knows about the online

10
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:32,800
identities and how

11
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,640
bad they are today but to recap

12
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:37,120
basically we actually have

13
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,559
uh each of us has an online identity

14
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,399
which is internet-wide

15
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:42,239
it's the one that is created by the big

16
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:43,920
advertising tracking platforms because

17
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:44,399
they know everything about us and they

18
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,879
cross

19
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:47,600
all different sources of data about us

20
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:49,440
so

21
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,360
we do have a single online identity but

22
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,480
we don't own it we actually don't even

23
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,800
know

24
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,398
a lot about it on the other hand when we

25
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,399
have to identify so we want to use

26
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:59,039
multiple services online we are still

27
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:00,640
stuck by

28
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:02,559
with having a thousand different

29
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,359
accounts with different passwords and

30
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:05,840
different

31
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,280
systems for login and and this is really

32
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,799
inconvenient it's insecure because

33
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,479
people use passwords or

34
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:12,720
then they cannot use them so they write

35
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:14,400
them down and so it's really a system

36
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,880
that doesn't work

37
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,880
so of course the solution is well known

38
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,080
the solution is a single sign on which

39
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,560
means that you have

40
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:24,080
some kind of authentication provider

41
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,360
which is the one that verifies your

42
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,039
credentials and so tells

43
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,040
everybody else all the services you want

44
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:32,000
to log into that you are you

45
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,799
and they should let you in and of course

46
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,960
this result

47
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,640
requires some kind of trusted

48
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:39,199
authentication provider

49
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,960
and of course the big internet platforms

50
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,520
the over the tops already thought about

51
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,199
this

52
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,119
so in the last two or three years

53
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,200
there's been this proliferation of

54
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:49,200
forms like this one they are now

55
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,840
everywhere almost on every website

56
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,360
as you see i mean most websites usually

57
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,880
give you these alternatives so you can

58
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,719
either login with facebook or with

59
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,520
google somehow only have facebook or

60
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:59,439
google

61
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,960
some have a few more and then there's a

62
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:02,719
tiny link and which is going to

63
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,000
disappear more and more if

64
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:06,158
you really want you can log in with your

65
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,520
own personal account with your email but

66
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:11,039
again that's going to disappear and

67
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,720
what's the problem with this the problem

68
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:14,399
is that this is proprietary not in terms

69
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:17,120
of protocols but in terms of the

70
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,720
implementation and of the actual service

71
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,160
so this is very convenient it's now

72
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,520
ubiquitous i mean you just click and

73
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,799
you're in you don't have to enter your

74
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,319
data everybody likes it

75
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,640
especially the average user that doesn't

76
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:28,720
realize the privacy implication of this

77
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,319
but it's really terrible if you think it

78
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,920
is first of all there is no

79
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:34,399
interoperability

80
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,119
it's fragmented so i mean you have if

81
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,319
they support

82
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,680
facebook you have to use facebook

83
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:38,720
facebook if they support google you have

84
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,319
to support google

85
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,080
so this leads to concentration because

86
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:43,599
of course no one will want to support

87
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,160
1000 systems on their

88
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:48,079
web page login and so the only the big

89
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,599
ones will survive

90
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,680
if you want to support more systems i

91
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:52,959
mean your website web web admin you

92
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,720
you have to implement each and every of

93
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,080
them separately again and again

94
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,440
and the users in the end don't have a

95
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,800
choice because you can only choose the

96
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:01,280
ones that are supported by

97
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,640
most websites and in the end this makes

98
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,000
tracking straightforward so the

99
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:06,399
platforms that already know everything

100
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,680
about us then they have an even easier

101
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,720
way to track us across

102
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:12,080
the multiple services we use and on the

103
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,599
other hand you get to situations like

104
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,440
this one which was actually funny this

105
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:18,079
was the recommended hotel for the

106
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,359
ietf or out working group the security

107
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,319
workshop they had and they recommended

108
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,760
all the handle

109
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:24,079
you choose between eight different

110
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:26,239
systems to log into your wi-fi

111
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:28,080
so this was really crazy so it showed

112
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:29,680
everyone at the itf also that there's a

113
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,159
problem that needs to be sold

114
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,720
so we need some kind of better way of

115
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:34,319
doing this

116
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,680
so we need openness because we cannot

117
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:36,560
allow these companies to own our

118
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,720
identities

119
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,080
and we need federation so that everybody

120
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:42,319
can run their identity and

121
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:45,040
or at least we can have thousands of

122
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:46,958
providers and we can have a choice

123
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,879
so of course single sign-on has a lot of

124
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:50,319
advantages so these are advantages that

125
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:52,000
you already get with the current system

126
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:53,679
so of course you only need one set of

127
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,640
credentials because you log

128
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,920
into a single place uh this place can be

129
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,518
made more and more secure because you

130
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:01,200
just need to implement for example to

131
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,799
factor authentication in the single

132
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,879
place where you login

133
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:06,720
and you have a way to control your

134
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:08,159
information as long as the provider lets

135
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,760
you control the information which google

136
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:12,079
and facebook unfortunately

137
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:13,518
basically don't and you don't need to

138
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,200
raise i mean in the end this idea of

139
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:17,199
registering for a website is going to go

140
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,959
away you just have to show your identity

141
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:19,840
in the same way you mean when you want

142
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,358
to

143
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:23,520
rent a car you show your identity

144
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:25,198
documents that's what's going to happen

145
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:28,159
in front of websites

146
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:29,759
and but if we succeeded in making this

147
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,960
public and federated there will be

148
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:34,639
more and more advantages so why cannot

149
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:37,198
single sign-on work like email

150
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:38,160
email is being an old-time service where

151
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,759
before all this

152
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,240
mass commercialization and big intense

153
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:43,600
platforms came email is still federated

154
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,320
which means that you can get your email

155
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,160
address from

156
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,599
whoever you want including running it

157
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,600
yourself and then

158
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,960
everyone can speak with everyone else

159
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,240
and that's how it works and there's no

160
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,080
reason why identities

161
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,600
should not work like that so you could

162
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,280
get your identity from whoever you want

163
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,479
or even run it yourself and then use it

164
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,479
everywhere

165
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:02,000
and we would just need one account for

166
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:03,199
everything and you could choose your

167
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,960
provider or you could even

168
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:07,759
run it yourself and you could possibly

169
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:09,758
choose one that is not selling you out

170
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:11,600
and you could also keep your identifier

171
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:12,639
which is a known problem so i mean you

172
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,280
have to own your own

173
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:17,120
username in a way otherwise it will

174
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:20,880
always depend on the company that

175
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:23,440
supplied you your username and this

176
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,880
so the technical problem is that to have

177
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,880
a federation you need what is called the

178
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,600
discovery mechanism so what's necessary

179
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,919
is that

180
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,840
someone shows you an identifier the

181
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:34,240
wrong let's say username

182
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,840
and you i mean the website the service

183
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,440
that needs to verify that you are you

184
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,198
needs to know where to go which server

185
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:42,639
to contact to

186
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:44,160
to do that and uh actually the the main

187
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:45,840
protocol that is used today including by

188
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,000
the propriety single sign-ons

189
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,198
for for online single sign-on is open id

190
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,120
connect i guess

191
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:53,280
people here are mostly i would say i

192
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,800
could be familiar with that

193
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,400
though i mean it has some federation

194
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,840
capabilities but it's never deployed in

195
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,679
a really federated manner so the

196
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,198
federation in the common deployments of

197
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,800
open id connect is that

198
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:04,240
the same company has 10 different

199
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,639
services and they all

200
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,840
use a centralized login server for login

201
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:09,520
identity provider

202
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,440
but it's always everything run by the

203
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,560
single company or at most by a group of

204
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,719
companies

205
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,240
and so we need a real federation so we

206
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,840
need to keep these directory of

207
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:20,319
identities somewhere so that

208
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:22,000
websites can look them up so where do we

209
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:24,080
do that and this is what we try to do i

210
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,720
mean the standard openid connect method

211
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:28,000
relies on web finger so it's a an https

212
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,080
call to the

213
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,080
to a web server running on your identity

214
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,919
provider which is a problem that you

215
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,359
need to have a website running for that

216
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:37,198
on each and every domain name or

217
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,759
identifier that you want to use

218
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:40,800
so it's not very handy and it's actually

219
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:42,479
i mean well

220
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,639
basically very hard to implement for

221
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:46,960
example for domain name industry for the

222
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,400
hosting industry for the isps because

223
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:50,960
you would need me

224
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:53,120
and so and also it requires you to have

225
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,799
a web big a certificate with

226
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,639
lesson clip you can get one for free but

227
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,000
still needs and

228
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:01,039
of course why not the blockchain there

229
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,880
are i mean i say thousands of identity

230
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:04,080
projects based on blockchains and it's

231
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,280
fine we have nothing against the

232
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,880
blockchain but we want something that

233
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,799
can actually compete today with the

234
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:10,159
biggest it is so it must be something

235
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,120
that is already available today

236
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,759
everywhere

237
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:15,039
it's tested it can scale to mass service

238
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:17,360
and so on

239
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:18,960
and everyone can just pick it up and run

240
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,280
it and so in the end

241
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,479
we're going for the dns and i mean the

242
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,679
dns usually

243
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:25,680
i mean there are people that love it

244
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,759
there are people who hate it but

245
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,360
it has several advantages because in the

246
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:30,960
end it is an open public standard

247
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,479
there's three implementations everywhere

248
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,520
you can just download one around your

249
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:35,280
dns server

250
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:37,039
it's widely available it's tested it

251
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,719
runs for 30 years on a

252
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:40,880
global scale it keeps the internet up

253
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,880
and so it's it has some kind of

254
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,400
regulation so even if there is some

255
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,560
centralization there's also some

256
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,919
regulation to prevent capture and so

257
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,160
maybe that's not perfect but it's

258
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:51,840
already there and it works

259
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,319
and so we chose to use the dns for the

260
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,440
namespace because also i mean to to to

261
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:57,039
have a global

262
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:59,919
internet scale online identities you

263
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:02,400
need a global a unique identifier

264
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:04,080
and of course our own names are not

265
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,560
unique identifiers there's many people

266
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,359
with

267
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:09,280
the same name over the world and so you

268
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,039
need a global namespace which is also

269
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,559
distributed and federated and

270
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:14,400
can be delegated and this is the problem

271
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:18,400
that was already solved with the dns

272
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:19,840
35 years ago so you can just use dns

273
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,440
names and people are actually familiar

274
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,878
with them

275
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,800
and they are human readable in the end

276
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:26,479
they are usually strings with dots in

277
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,919
the middle you could even use email

278
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:29,440
addresses just convert them into a

279
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:31,919
domain name with a fixed

280
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:33,679
hashing algorithm and in the end this

281
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:35,279
would also allow people to just buy a

282
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,799
domain name for a few euros

283
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:38,799
and become owners of their own

284
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:40,399
identifier which is another advantage so

285
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:42,240
then you could just move your identifier

286
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:45,680
across different providers if you

287
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:47,920
don't like your current provider anymore

288
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,920
and and so it's also very easy to

289
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:52,079
realize that the discoveries came to

290
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:54,319
make a discoveries came over the dns

291
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:56,000
since again email basically does that

292
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,279
email has the same problem you have an

293
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,160
email address you need to know which

294
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:00,080
server is

295
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,519
managing it and so there's the mx record

296
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:04,240
in the dns that tells you

297
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:04,800
which server is managing it and we did

298
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,399
the same

299
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,240
we're not going for a new resource

300
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:09,839
record type because that's

301
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,760
hard to get implemented we're just using

302
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:12,959
a txt record like many other new

303
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,040
protocols

304
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:16,399
and we there are actually the internet

305
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,399
drafts already there

306
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:19,920
they are we are not at the moment going

307
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:21,279
forward with this standardization

308
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,279
because first we want to get

309
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:24,399
implementations and prove that it works

310
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:26,880
and so on but but the

311
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:28,880
drafts are already there they are public

312
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,880
so basically this is what we did

313
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:32,399
we just chose that i mean you can use

314
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,839
whatever

315
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:36,320
valid host name even if it doesn't

316
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,760
correspond to an existing server in a

317
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,360
domain that you control so that you can

318
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:41,279
create records in it

319
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,360
and you can just create a standard

320
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:45,279
specially used txt record

321
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,959
and which points them to a stringer

322
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:47,519
which basically tells you where this is

323
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:48,719
being run

324
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:51,200
who is the issuer and the claims

325
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,720
provider for your identity in open ide

326
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:56,399
connect speak

327
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:58,480
so and so

328
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:00,320
well the project in itself is basically

329
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,560
this it's just an attempt

330
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:04,959
not to become yet another identity

331
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:06,239
provider or group of companies or

332
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:08,079
entities that compete to provide

333
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,000
identities against everyone else

334
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:11,439
but it's meant to provide the basic

335
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,800
building technology to allow

336
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,480
everyone to run providers and

337
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,399
interoperate with each other

338
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,079
so the point is that we want to create

339
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:19,680
basically a set of open

340
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:21,279
patent-free standards that are there for

341
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,760
everyone to implement the traditional

342
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:25,040
way like

343
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:27,200
email is i mean we are an email company

344
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:29,199
so this is why we believe in this model

345
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,959
and so in the end we do have also a

346
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,480
foundation here in brussels it's a

347
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:34,079
non-profit

348
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,000
we decided to have one because you need

349
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:37,599
the place basically to ask companies and

350
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,440
supporters to put money and then spend

351
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,040
it for the project to pay

352
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,720
for example promotion and people to

353
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,640
develop something maybe and

354
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,320
and other expenses so it's not a

355
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:48,079
controlling entity anyway the standard

356
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,560
is open everyone can implement it

357
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:51,599
it's more like a place where we can run

358
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,920
additional

359
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:56,480
activities over that including some i

360
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:59,199
mean well i will i will come to that

361
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:01,440
basically the the architecture of the

362
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,279
roles in united for me is

363
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,360
more or less the same as the traditional

364
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:07,120
openid connect system

365
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,959
except that we decided to break the

366
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,600
traditional identity provider role in

367
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:11,518
two

368
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,800
partly because i mean among the original

369
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:14,320
supporters there are several

370
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,640
companies and people from the domain

371
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,200
name industry which i mean that's not

372
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,439
surprising

373
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,680
since we are using the dns and so we we

374
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:24,240
have a sort of separation that mimics

375
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,519
the domain name registrar and registry

376
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,200
separation so we have

377
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:28,720
an identity authority which is basically

378
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,160
the registry for identities

379
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,839
and the only thing that it does it

380
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,319
verifies your credentials so enhance

381
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:35,200
your

382
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:36,880
authentication and it doesn't get to

383
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,240
actually know your data so i mean

384
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:40,160
the data and the relationship with you

385
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,519
are kept by your agent

386
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:43,360
which is the other entity which

387
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:44,800
basically gives you the service so that

388
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,240
you could even change agent without

389
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,920
changing the authority or you can change

390
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,680
both or you can run both on the same

391
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,680
service you could even have a service

392
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:54,399
running both roles at the same time

393
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:55,040
it's entirely free but at least i mean

394
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:57,200
for

395
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:59,360
for the attempt to i mean to get to the

396
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,959
real average users which needs to be

397
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,079
built upon an existing industry to have

398
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:05,119
chance to actually reach

399
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:06,479
out for people uh then this is i we

400
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:09,440
thought this is the best

401
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,079
way of organize it and and so in the end

402
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,680
you you

403
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:13,839
provide your information and manage it

404
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:15,359
with the agent and then the authority is

405
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:16,720
the trust anchor is let's say in the

406
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,000
authentication system

407
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:21,040
that guarantees that i mean the

408
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,120
authentication is being done correctly

409
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,719
and so the login flow is actually pretty

410
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,560
standard if anyone is familiar with

411
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:28,639
openid connect

412
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,920
so i mean it's a basically it is a

413
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:33,440
standard definitely connect

414
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:34,880
login process except that before

415
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:37,519
starting the entire process you have to

416
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:39,680
do this dns query so the reliant party

417
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:41,519
will have to discover who is running

418
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,079
your identity who is managing it and so

419
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:44,160
the

420
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:45,279
they will make this dns query and

421
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:47,439
getting return to the

422
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:49,120
record and discover which which server

423
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:51,519
they have to contact to start up the

424
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,880
normal open id connect login process

425
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:54,639
which then uses

426
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,399
a feature open a d connect which is

427
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:58,880
called distributed claims so that

428
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:00,560
the the initial identity provider which

429
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:02,480
is the authority then redirects

430
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:04,638
the relying party to the agent with a

431
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,320
signed token so that they can actually

432
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:08,240
get your personal information

433
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,079
but the the nice thing in this process

434
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,560
that the authority for example can ask

435
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:12,800
you

436
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:14,399
actually which data you want to share so

437
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:16,639
i mean you

438
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:18,160
you have a set of information but for

439
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:19,040
the moment it's a basic one but in

440
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:21,839
theory you could

441
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:23,120
standardize names and claims for any

442
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:24,800
kind of information that you would like

443
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:27,839
to share with websites from your

444
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:29,680
frequent flyer number to whatever

445
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:31,120
and then when you log in uh with the

446
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,560
first time you log into a website that

447
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,920
the authority asks you i mean this is

448
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,719
the information they would like to have

449
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,639
about you

450
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,839
and do you agree so do you give consent

451
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:39,760
and you can choose

452
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:42,079
for each information field whether you

453
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:45,199
agree with sharing it or not

454
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:47,439
and then this is signed and gets to send

455
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:48,399
to the agent then so that the agent

456
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:51,040
knows which

457
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:52,800
data they they actually can share with

458
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,639
with the relying party

459
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,560
and so in this way we are trying to put

460
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:58,480
back control over data sharing in the

461
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:01,199
hands of of the user

462
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,880
so that in the end it's the user that

463
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:04,000
chooses which information gets passed on

464
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:07,199
to the website

465
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,279
and so on so

466
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:11,279
as i said that the status is like the

467
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:12,560
process the project is about a couple of

468
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:15,680
years old

469
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:17,199
it was initially promoted by a few

470
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,880
german companies now it's becoming

471
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:20,959
international there are more

472
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:22,320
entities signing in profit for profit

473
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:24,560
and nonprofit

474
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,560
so there's a website there's

475
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:28,479
specification and there's an api

476
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,920
there are several prototypes test beds

477
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,639
there's actually an id for me based at

478
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,479
the service

479
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:33,680
which is the unique id dining is the

480
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,160
manager for the

481
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:38,000
top level domain in germany so they are

482
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:40,079
the first company that really tries to

483
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,240
release a public service based on this

484
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:44,319
and this technology and they're

485
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:46,720
basically about to launch it

486
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:48,720
and uh we are working on the possibility

487
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,240
of adding a verification layer on top of

488
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,079
this so you can still i mean this the

489
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,519
data in that is what you put in in it so

490
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:55,040
it's not verified you can use it also

491
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:56,560
anonymously pseudonymously

492
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:58,399
you decide you can have many identities

493
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:00,399
whatever you want but for

494
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:01,600
certain use cases you might want to have

495
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:03,120
a third party

496
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,880
validate that you are you and in that

497
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:07,440
case we are building the extensions to

498
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:09,279
the standard that would allow

499
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,560
basically a third party to sign an

500
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:12,800
attestation and so on

501
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,839
and so provide verified identities and

502
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,519
we have now about

503
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:17,680
30 members in the international

504
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:19,920
nonprofit here in brussels

505
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:21,359
so what's coming next if anyone here

506
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:24,240
will attend the cloudfest

507
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:25,279
in germany there's going to be a

508
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,360
hackathon project

509
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:28,399
to develop a completely free server

510
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,399
implementation

511
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:31,600
we already have a part of it so we want

512
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:33,519
to finish it and release it

513
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,040
so that it's available to everyone we

514
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:36,639
already have several authentication

515
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,639
plugins for several languages they are

516
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:40,639
also free and so on

517
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:42,160
and so we are as i said we are working

518
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:44,000
on the verified identities

519
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:45,600
part so that you can have a stronger

520
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,360
identity and we are discussing the

521
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,480
reputation issue and i want to stress

522
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,839
this because this is a problem that

523
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,639
comes up in any

524
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:54,320
federated approach and it should not be

525
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:55,839
underestimated because it is a difficult

526
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,519
project because

527
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:59,680
in the end if you are google you can say

528
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:00,399
okay in google i decide which degree of

529
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,000
uh

530
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:04,480
validity i want to give them the

531
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,480
information i pass to websites and i

532
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,720
people have to trust me in a federated

533
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,920
system like exactly it happens for email

534
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,759
with spam and so on

535
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:13,199
there could be people that run services

536
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:14,560
in a bad way

537
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:16,160
and so you need to have some way to

538
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:17,199
exchange the reputation information and

539
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,959
be sure that

540
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:20,800
if someone is telling that this person

541
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:22,239
is authenticated and designed from

542
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:24,160
their data they are not just making

543
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,680
everything up at least for certain use

544
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,560
cases so this is the discussion we are

545
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,160
having around

546
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:31,199
how to manage the reputation of the

547
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:32,880
operators so this is the website

548
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:34,240
uh you can go there and there's

549
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,680
everything about the project there's

550
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,839
also the technical part with

551
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:39,519
documentation links to a github space

552
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:42,160
and whatever

553
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:51,600
and that's it so basically thank you and

554
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:54,000
i'm happy to take questions

555
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,720
yeah hi i have a question so when i'm a

556
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,240
website

557
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,839
and i integrate the login with google

558
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:00,480
button

559
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:01,759
for the sso for my users basically the

560
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,560
reason i do that is because i trust

561
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:04,799
google that

562
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:06,000
it's doing the authentication correctly

563
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:09,039
for the user

564
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,439
but if i for example use id for me

565
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:13,280
i don't know who i'm asking and in

566
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:15,439
augmented connect i usually

567
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:17,439
need a client with the identity provider

568
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:18,799
right so how does that work because they

569
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:19,600
need to establish some kind of trust

570
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:21,520
yeah with the

571
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:23,599
identity provider yeah as i was saying

572
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:25,359
that this is like the key problem we

573
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:26,719
we are discussing exactly because i mean

574
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:29,120
we decided to make

575
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:31,120
for example the client registration open

576
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:32,639
and dynamics so you don't need to

577
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:34,479
ask the identity provider for a key to

578
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,120
start being a reliant party because that

579
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:38,160
would make

580
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:38,879
the federation unworkable uh but yeah i

581
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,240
mean

582
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,320
in the end it depends on the airline

583
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:44,320
party because if you're just uh

584
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:45,600
i mean a basic website a forum for

585
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:48,159
obvious or whatever

586
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:49,360
you don't need any any real certainty

587
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,880
about the data i mean you

588
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,559
people are actually that's a case in

589
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:55,280
which people should be encouraged to

590
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:56,720
log in anonymously if they want on the

591
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,080
other hand for some services you might

592
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:00,320
really want to be sure about their

593
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:01,840
entire process and in that case possibly

594
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,799
you are the relying party want to put

595
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:05,840
some barrier

596
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:06,960
on the on the identity provider that is

597
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,639
being used so i mean

598
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,080
since you cannot know i mean you could

599
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,200
in theory say i will only accept

600
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:13,600
identities from

601
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,559
these one two three identity providers

602
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,799
but again this is

603
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:18,000
doesn't scale so what we are thinking is

604
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:19,280
that we could have some kind of

605
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,039
certification

606
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,879
so that you can get some cryptographic

607
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:24,480
station that does i mean this provider

608
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,440
has been verified up to this level of

609
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,120
verification

610
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,960
so you can more or less trust that they

611
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,399
are who they are and this other is

612
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,559
completely unknown so it

613
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,919
accept it as your own risk but on the

614
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:35,520
other hand we don't want to make this

615
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:37,360
too hard because otherwise you will

616
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:41,039
rule out the self-hosting of identities

617
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:43,760
which i think is a pretty important case

618
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:44,559
i have a question uh the open id connect

619
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,760
uh

620
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:47,678
process of they have they have a

621
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:49,360
certification process

622
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:50,640
uh did you take your services through

623
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,320
that process or did you talk to the

624
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,960
people about certifying your

625
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:56,399
services yeah i mean you mean the

626
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,280
certification of the implementation yeah

627
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,200
i mean the

628
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:01,200
uh as i said denis who is the first

629
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,799
company that is launching services

630
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,240
is an open indian foundation member and

631
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:05,918
they have applied so their

632
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,360
server implementation is being certified

633
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:09,360
by the openid foundation

634
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:10,639
and also we have been submitting some of

635
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:13,120
this this development

636
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:14,320
for standardization basically in some of

637
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,918
the extensions i mean there are a couple

638
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:18,320
of extensions that just came out to open

639
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:19,840
eddie connect in terms of federation and

640
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:21,439
and they were actually influenced by

641
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,000
some of us participating in the working

642
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,080
groups and

643
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,600
bringing ideas and of course we want to

644
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:27,520
be aligned so in the end

645
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:29,120
if of course this is still catching up

646
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,720
so there are no websites are almost

647
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,439
today except maybe for denik and a few

648
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,200
of you

649
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,640
that accepted these identities so this

650
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,880
is the the challenge

651
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,400
if this gains adoption everything i mean

652
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,919
we're going to apply for standardization

653
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,120
of all the parts of the protocol both

654
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:45,200
are the open id foundation and

655
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:47,280
the itf my question is

656
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:49,440
have you thought about integrating with

657
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:52,320
the decentralized identity

658
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:53,919
standard that is going to be developed

659
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:55,520
okay you know another side i mean

660
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:57,280
we have thought about getting the id

661
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,600
schema for example for id for me so i

662
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,760
mean

663
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:01,678
i mean some kind of if that's what

664
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:04,000
you're referring to

665
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:06,960
there's already the id message for web

666
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,880
so you can write some kind of in dns

667
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:10,400
it looks kind of similar it's just how

668
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:12,640
to resolve

669
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,840
so yeah as i said we i mean we haven't

670
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:16,480
done it yet but we

671
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:17,520
we have not i mean we could do it we

672
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:21,840
actually have thought on it

673
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:21,840
so i mean

674
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:29,760
um is there any place here at fosdem

675
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:32,159
where i can find people for an open

676
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:35,280
exchange to chat with them or you

677
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:37,600
yeah with me it doesn't sever here

678
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:38,960
so yeah just grab us later either on

679
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:49,840
this or any other thing that operator

680
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:49,840
change is doing so

681
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,520
um have you thought about a use case

682
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:57,918
where you're not trying to identify a

683
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:59,200
web application but any other thing that

684
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:02,720
doesn't have a browser

685
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:06,320
available sorry i speak loudly because

686
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:08,799
have you tried about identifying uh

687
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:10,799
providing the ability to uh identify

688
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:14,158
outside of the browser

689
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:15,280
uh yeah i mean yeah we were trying to

690
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:17,200
for example see whether

691
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:18,799
this could be used for imap logging for

692
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,320
example all these kind of things

693
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:21,280
there's not been the focus yet because

694
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,280
of course there's a problem with the

695
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:25,120
interactivity because openid connect

696
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:26,879
is an interactive process for them but i

697
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:28,239
think you could get your token and store

698
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:30,080
it around when you could find ways

699
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:32,159
but we have not worked on this yet it's

700
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:35,918
it's on the list of two things

701
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:35,919
but if you want to help you're welcome

702
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:42,959
um have you looked at engaging with web

703
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:45,840
standards bodies or

704
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:47,760
web browsers to help standardize this so

705
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:50,080
you could just have a

706
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:51,679
new html component to have a federated

707
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:53,918
login for example

708
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:55,760
yeah i mean we do not have browsers at

709
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:57,360
the spot at this point in time

710
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:58,799
also this is a very european project

711
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:00,399
originally german now european

712
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:02,158
there are no basically european browser

713
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:04,480
makers so we we

714
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:05,520
yeah okay so so if you're interested

715
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:07,760
please join

716
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:10,158
and uh yeah i think that some degree of

717
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:13,039
support in the browsers would help a lot

718
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:13,679
uh i we i had a quick chat with mozilla

719
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:15,440
like

720
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:17,360
over a year ago the problem is that they

721
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:18,799
tried persona if you remember it and

722
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:20,158
then it didn't really work so they are

723
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:21,840
sort of

724
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:26,799
wary of these kind of things but this is

725
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:28,320
how i understood

726
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:30,158
i was wondering if you can talk a bit

727
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:31,200
more about the the status of the project

728
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:33,600
because if i

729
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:36,960
understand correctly most of the the

730
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:39,600
components basically are just uh

731
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:40,320
thin layers in front of id connector

732
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,959
providers

733
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:44,879
and other data storage so it's just a

734
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,720
matter of writing this uh small

735
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:48,799
yeah exactly this this was a design

736
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:49,840
feature so when we decided not to design

737
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:51,440
everything from scratch

738
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:53,360
but to try to design something which had

739
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:55,760
an implementation path which is as

740
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:57,360
short as possible so yeah for the

741
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:58,799
relying path it's actually just this dns

742
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:00,158
call in front of a standalone penalty

743
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:01,679
connect implementation

744
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:03,440
then if you want to support some of

745
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:04,880
these more advanced features

746
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,960
maybe you want to customize at the time

747
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:09,039
but but basically yeah and also

748
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:10,480
denix is running the implementation for

749
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:12,080
the server side and

750
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:14,080
by using an open id connect server and

751
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:15,280
just developing a few things on top of

752
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:18,480
it so yeah

753
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:20,000
okay okay thank you very much and i'm

754
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,880
here around if you still have questions

755
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:34,640
of course

756
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:34,640
please give him a warm round of applause
