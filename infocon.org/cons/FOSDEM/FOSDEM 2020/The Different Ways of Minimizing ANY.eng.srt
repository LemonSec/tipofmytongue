1
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,160
hello everybody

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:11,679
welcome to our final talk of the session

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,920
out of the day there's another dev room

4
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:17,119
in here this afternoon

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:19,759
this is edward lewis of icann

6
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:21,920
without having hardware troubles like

7
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:24,800
all of us all the time

8
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,800
and eyesight problems

9
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:29,198
the the microphone fell off the clip and

10
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,720
when i look at something that small it

11
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:34,320
disappears because my

12
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:38,160
age of eyesight is advancing

13
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:40,879
and i left my reading glasses my my uh

14
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:43,040
other jacket edwards will be talking

15
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:45,280
about a different way of minimizing any

16
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,239
yes good luck thank you thank you thank

17
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:49,200
you very much

18
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:51,120
all right so um this i guess this is

19
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,680
kind of sort of a pet peeve of mine

20
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,879
um and i talked to the authors about it

21
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,640
uh of the document

22
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:58,399
and they encouraged me to bring this and

23
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,079
bring it up i'm going to try to make

24
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:01,199
this pet peeve interesting to software

25
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:02,239
developers that's kind of where i'm

26
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:05,438
going with this

27
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:06,880
um so uh the the title here

28
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:09,360
in the subtitle i have the name of a

29
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,960
document it's an rfc from the ietf came

30
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,119
out a little while ago

31
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:15,119
uh talking about how to minimize uh

32
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:17,520
response responding to any

33
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:18,960
um i'll talk about why we have this

34
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,880
document a little bit about that

35
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,280
an observation i've made a measurement

36
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,880
based on dealing with this

37
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,320
then trying to find out why i see the

38
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,640
results i saw

39
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:30,000
and then see is this a good thing or a

40
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,960
bad thing for the trend of software

41
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,840
development

42
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,479
and of course i have to ment uh bert who

43
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,759
bears

44
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:37,759
camel at the end of this because that's

45
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:40,799
everything's about the camel

46
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:41,920
uh so the document uh why does it exist

47
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,399
the q type

48
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,479
q type any is a feature of the original

49
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:48,720
dns it's been around since the start

50
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:49,520
um and it's had it has basically three

51
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,560
uses

52
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:54,479
one's benign that is you can use it to

53
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,759
get a lot of information about a name

54
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:57,600
if you go to the authoritative server

55
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:58,479
and ask it and you can get everything

56
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,839
that's there you're kind of like

57
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:01,360
snooping on what the authoritative

58
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,960
server is saying about that name

59
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,560
regardless of type it has everything

60
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:07,600
comes back

61
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,520
it has a problematic use because some

62
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:12,000
people realize they could do that

63
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,440
and use it to ask recursive servers the

64
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,360
same question

65
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,720
not really recursive servers don't get

66
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,520
all of the records

67
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:21,359
so they may not have all of the stuff

68
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,080
and any and all became kind of confused

69
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,160
and that was the first

70
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,360
road down to this being a problem number

71
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:28,000
then finally

72
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,040
it became kind of a what is a malicious

73
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,480
use of this

74
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,160
because if you wanted to generate a

75
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,879
large volume of traffic for

76
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,680
for say a traffic flooding ddos you

77
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:37,599
could ask for

78
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,720
all the records any of the records at

79
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:40,480
some name and get

80
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:43,120
huge massive stuff especially with dns

81
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:45,599
sec uh the larger use of names now

82
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:47,040
and flood uh victims with lots of

83
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:49,119
traffic

84
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,720
those are the three uh probably most

85
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,319
obvious ways of seeing this

86
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,160
query go from being something that was

87
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:56,000
useful to something that we really

88
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:59,200
wanted to kind of get rid of

89
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,599
so uh and for a while i was very much in

90
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,720
getting

91
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:02,319
i want to get rid of this too at one

92
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,359
time when i was working in a job that

93
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:05,119
this was in fact uh

94
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,400
impacting us uh but when this was

95
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,760
written i was not part of the

96
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,840
the effort it had moved on to other

97
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:13,280
folks and i moved out of that job uh

98
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:15,840
so but in doing this and saying that the

99
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:18,159
this any we had to get kind of stopped

100
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,920
using any queries

101
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:21,440
what do you do instead how do you say no

102
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,720
i don't do that anymore yes it doesn't

103
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,079
really happen

104
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,239
but there were a few ways to look at

105
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:28,560
this one was to say we don't do that but

106
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:29,920
we don't have that way of doing this

107
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:33,040
in the dns it's kind of funny because

108
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:36,159
videos you say no to someone's

109
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:38,159
query uh in in a sense of an error

110
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:39,760
that may make them try again or even

111
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:41,280
more frequently in fact we see if we

112
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:44,239
stop answering queries

113
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,200
for for reasons we see traffic come up

114
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:46,560
instead of go down

115
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:49,280
it goes backwards because people are

116
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:52,959
trying harder to get information

117
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:54,480
also uh yeah we also realize we want to

118
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:55,920
help those that were doing things the

119
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,399
old way backwards capacity those that

120
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,159
were

121
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,000
using the problematic version of this we

122
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:02,399
want to make them not be pained by

123
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,840
this and so the protocol developers

124
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,840
tried to come up with some way

125
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,280
to say no we're not doing it anymore

126
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,879
that would appease all of the interests

127
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:12,400
that were involved here

128
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:14,399
uh and to go to go before i go further

129
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,840
the way that says no is that there are

130
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,358
three in the doctor there are three

131
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,199
different things that can happen

132
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:20,638
instead of sending back everything you

133
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:23,360
have about the name

134
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:24,000
uh when you're asked for for any any is

135
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,320
not all but

136
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,600
any is a query you can send back a

137
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,840
subset

138
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:32,240
just pick something and just send it

139
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,840
back minimize it coming back

140
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,919
the second thing is to come back with a

141
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,479
synthesized h info which in the previous

142
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:38,960
talk

143
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:39,599
uh leo mentioned that that was revived

144
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,680
by

145
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,960
cloudflare's effort who happened to be

146
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,040
the people

147
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,159
participating in this document they

148
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,160
brought that back to life saying we'll

149
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,320
use the h info record to say

150
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,680
this is a minimized any query out there

151
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:55,360
and the third one was

152
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:56,960
try to guess what the query wanted

153
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,479
and if you've ever written dns code you

154
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,000
realize that dns doesn't give you much

155
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:00,400
information beyond here's what i'm

156
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,639
asking

157
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,919
i don't tell you why so it's kind of

158
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:05,280
hard to guess

159
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:07,520
when you're writing code i don't code

160
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,960
that can guess is really kind of hard

161
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,639
sometimes it might you might have an

162
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:13,680
idea but um

163
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:15,280
not always now this

164
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,120
i'm not picking on this document because

165
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:19,198
the document actually mentions

166
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:22,320
the points i want to make and these are

167
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:24,240
verbatim uh clips from the document

168
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,000
the first one says this mecca does not

169
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,479
signal that an incomplete subset has

170
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,840
been

171
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:30,240
coming back it doesn't tell you that

172
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:32,719
it's minimized it number two

173
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,639
it receives h info in response but it's

174
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,479
not possible to tell us h info was

175
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:38,320
synthesized for this purpose

176
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:40,400
uh so then again it's not really that

177
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:42,479
reliable and and the last one is

178
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,758
it's not it's possible to guess what if

179
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:46,400
initiator wants

180
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:47,120
but not always so i could tell here that

181
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,799
the authors

182
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,720
were not trying to just cut things off

183
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,199
but they really had there's no place to

184
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,080
go with

185
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:56,319
that that's this is great uh so to

186
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:59,520
clarify my complaint here is i'm not

187
00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:00,080
out to stop limiting the query any um i

188
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,880
think it

189
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:04,479
it's really uh kind of not a use not

190
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,240
necessary to the protocol

191
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:07,199
um the problem is i don't like the way

192
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,639
this kind of is becoming

193
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:10,479
non-deterministic

194
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,160
you ask a question you get back an

195
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:13,520
answer which might be a mystery or might

196
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,880
be the response you can't tell one or

197
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,599
the other

198
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:19,039
and this has happened before this is a

199
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,680
small issue probably but

200
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:22,400
i see it the same way we we overuse

201
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,800
serve fail

202
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,159
to mean errors of dns sect versus other

203
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,960
service failures

204
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,560
and uh there was the the use of the txt

205
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,880
record for everything out there

206
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,319
and if you remember the spf record uh

207
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,880
having having you with male

208
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:38,240
male protection you know that didn't go

209
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,639
well

210
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,080
so uh so my little experiment i i run

211
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:43,919
something where i do the any i do the

212
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:46,159
any query all the time i use it

213
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:47,359
to look at the tld operator the tops of

214
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,960
the tld zones

215
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,039
and so i know i have an idea what's

216
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,159
going to come back so when i ran this i

217
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:54,560
i run 13

218
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,680
475 queries for this experiment i don't

219
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,720
normally do this but

220
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:01,120
i asked every name server for every tld

221
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:03,680
on any query what did i get back um i

222
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:06,800
got about 250 to 260

223
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:08,800
no's uh udp tcp i tried both of them

224
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,560
um and but the thing that got me is i

225
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,599
got like nine or ten different ways they

226
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,360
said no

227
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:16,880
in that small sample that really bugged

228
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:18,960
me it's a small sample 19 different ways

229
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,479
and then the absolute numbers here are

230
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,400
kind of over counts because

231
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:24,400
operators do do a whole lot of work

232
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,719
together uh if one operator changed

233
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,638
their decision they might switch 250

234
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,479
responses right away

235
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:32,319
but to give you a graphical view of this

236
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:34,000
and i don't really have a good co i

237
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:35,360
got the small crayon set at work so i

238
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,599
don't have a lot of colors

239
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,800
um so i did this chart this way uh the

240
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:41,759
first chart shows

241
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:43,120
uh i i asked this many times i got that

242
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,280
many responses of course it's pretty

243
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:47,759
good they're tld's out there

244
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:49,599
of in udp i get a lot of truncation

245
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:51,599
which is okay it's understandable you

246
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:53,120
truncate large response in udp

247
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:54,878
but of the the ones that got through

248
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,479
there that were problematic

249
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,680
i gotta spread don't worry about what

250
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:59,120
they are over there there's a spread a

251
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,000
lot of colors in there in that circle

252
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,520
over there

253
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,720
and that covers everything including if

254
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,318
you look through there there's the h

255
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,319
info down towards the bottom

256
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:08,080
that's the special case for the h info

257
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,759
record all the other ones were

258
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,120
that was the one type that was seen

259
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:12,000
there except for the empty one of course

260
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,720
that means nothing came

261
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
back and i got 10 different ways in udp

262
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,520
for tcp

263
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,520
same thing except i don't have any

264
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,799
truncation in tcp

265
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,318
and i get back another little color

266
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,520
wheel with lots of different variation

267
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:25,919
out there

268
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:27,520
again the fact that the ns1 is the

269
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:29,359
biggest part that only means that

270
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,719
somebody does it a lot that way doesn't

271
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,159
necessarily mean there's a lot more use

272
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,599
of ns

273
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,880
so i started drilling into the numbers

274
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:36,000
because at first it looked this was that

275
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,958
was what i thought was interesting to

276
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,640
see but then i

277
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:40,159
said well let me figure out why i got

278
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,679
this why am i getting these numbers i

279
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:42,479
found some of the ip addresses out there

280
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:44,880
i ask

281
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:46,720
for different ip for different tlds

282
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:49,920
respond differently

283
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,880
so somehow it's being a ch is a choice

284
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:53,360
based on either

285
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,399
per query or per zone or for something

286
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,240
going out there

287
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:58,000
so i decided to figure out can i find

288
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:00,720
some more patterns here

289
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,560
well it turns out that tld operators out

290
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,000
there sometimes don't really

291
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,680
hide they don't want to hide their

292
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,200
version so they actually version.bind

293
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:09,279
actually works for some of them

294
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:11,440
and i'm looking at version. now that's

295
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:13,360
mostly not a great way to get data but

296
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,040
i got something out of it and so i

297
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,360
looked at the and that and there was

298
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,040
like

299
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,480
half a dozen implementations that popped

300
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:21,439
up that i could identify

301
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,800
um three of them appear on this chart it

302
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,760
means three of them were minimizing

303
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,760
there were no

304
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:27,040
there's no evidence from the other three

305
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,040
that um

306
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,640
they were minimizing remind you i have

307
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,719
the big four up here

308
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,760
so three of the big four and that's bind

309
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:37,040
nsd

310
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:39,680
on uh uh ns say bind nsd not

311
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,719
and a parody and so the big four open

312
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,719
open source uh

313
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,800
implementations like i call three of

314
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,720
them are minimizing some way

315
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,079
and you can see what how it comes out

316
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,000
here where there's

317
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:52,720
uh empty answers from some of them are

318
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,320
not from inflation one and three

319
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,680
they all do ns only and then there's

320
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,320
other types that are spread out there

321
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,719
which

322
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,320
i i couldn't really explain so i

323
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,519
actually did want to explain this

324
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,600
so i look at the configuration

325
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:05,120
information documentation and from what

326
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,440
i could tell

327
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:09,440
an nsd there's a refuse any option and

328
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,839
it says what it does here in on udp it

329
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,959
would

330
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:14,079
truncate and for tcp uh it works like

331
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:17,839
normal

332
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:18,719
uh default is no uh bine 914 6 says that

333
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:22,240
over udp

334
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:23,680
it'll pick only one of the rr sets

335
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,279
to go out there it doesn't seem about

336
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,560
tcp in there so i couldn't tell it was

337
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:27,360
going to happen i didn't experiment

338
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:30,560
myself

339
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:32,640
default is no and i looked up not power

340
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:34,319
dns and i could not find documentation

341
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:36,720
saying how to do it

342
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,680
um but i found email in but through

343
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,839
doing the searches

344
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:42,239
web searches saying that this was just

345
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:44,880
not done

346
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:47,040
so looking at these four big four and

347
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:48,800
how they let you configure this

348
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,399
didn't answer the question of how did i

349
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:53,839
have it answered differently per

350
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:54,640
tld um in fact if this doesn't even

351
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:57,839
match up

352
00:10:54,640 --> 00:11:02,079
i have three out of four doing this

353
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:03,600
even though two say how and how they um

354
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:05,519
the choices just don't line up with us

355
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,440
it's still kind of interesting to me

356
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:08,560
uh to figure out how this is going on uh

357
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,800
so i'm a bit baffled

358
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,839
by this um i couldn't see evidence that

359
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,079
operators

360
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:15,360
were able to make choices that looked

361
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:17,760
like it was intentional

362
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,120
in doing this i didn't see that some

363
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,760
operator always answered a certain way

364
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,680
in fact

365
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,880
i was baffled by one particular name

366
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,399
server which answered

367
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:26,160
the same way for all but one of the

368
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:28,480
zones it was serving up

369
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,839
i don't know so i don't know it's

370
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,160
somewhere in the software somewhere in

371
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:32,640
the

372
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:34,560
operations it's not quite lined up yet

373
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,680
um why does this bother me i mean i i

374
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,079
really don't care much about the any

375
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,640
query

376
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:40,000
i'll get into that but in the principles

377
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,519
principles of protocol design i like

378
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,800
determinism i want to know

379
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:44,640
query goes out i should get back a

380
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,319
predictable result or a very definitive

381
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:49,920
signal when it comes back

382
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:51,279
two i have this long term running uh

383
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,519
relationship with with operators and

384
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:55,040
realizing that we staff

385
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:56,399
the desks with people who have less

386
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,920
background over time just because of

387
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:00,880
growth and

388
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:02,479
so i want the protocol to be simpler one

389
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,680
time i heard this from somebody i wish i

390
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,560
could have a better support for this

391
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,719
statement but

392
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:08,160
a protocol design should be like a state

393
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,360
machine you have state machines on both

394
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,360
ends of the channel

395
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,800
and as you trans go for you can

396
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,399
transition from state to state based on

397
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,040
each message going back and forth or

398
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:16,639
each

399
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:18,639
signal going back and forth timeouts or

400
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:20,560
whatever should be very deterministic

401
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:21,920
if i'm on this side and i want and i

402
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,040
think your site is thinking this and i'm

403
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,880
telling them something

404
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,959
i want them to go here in the

405
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,399
conversation uh i don't want them to

406
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:29,359
actually kind of like maybe they're over

407
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:30,560
here now i don't know

408
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,160
like it makes it very hard to

409
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,638
communicate in a protocol when you have

410
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,639
this

411
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:35,920
like random number generator essentially

412
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:37,760
popping up there

413
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:39,439
now grant dns is not really good at this

414
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,800
but it's it's a dream i'd like to have

415
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,639
the protocol be very

416
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,599
specific so that both sides know where

417
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:45,839
each other what you're just thinking

418
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:48,880
going back and forth

419
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:50,160
uh now the

420
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:52,160
how does this apply to my observations

421
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,399
here i'm talking i want i didn't bring

422
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,240
this

423
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:56,240
slide up earlier i probably should have

424
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,480
i was asking

425
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,360
from this end about information over

426
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:02,240
here

427
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:03,519
but i know over here these are apex they

428
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,360
should have an soa record

429
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:06,880
you should have an ns record if they

430
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,160
have dns sect they should have a certain

431
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,680
set of records depending on what kind of

432
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,279
dns they have

433
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:13,519
so i have an expectation on this side of

434
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:14,880
why i should come back and i'm not

435
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:17,120
seeing that come back and i can

436
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:18,560
tell it's an error think about this in a

437
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,480
more generic case where

438
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:22,560
i don't know what this name is is it an

439
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:25,120
apex is it not an apex i don't know

440
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:27,119
if i get back one one record set i might

441
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,720
think that is all it has

442
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,720
if it's if it it's better so it's a

443
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,600
little this is this is some uncertainty

444
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,160
in my

445
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,959
uh in my mind here about the way this

446
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,719
this

447
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:38,399
uh rfc is recommended coming back with

448
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,160
the don't don't i don't do the full

449
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:42,480
thing

450
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:44,240
um now should i be able to minimize any

451
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,079
response is a good fair question

452
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:48,480
um because i go back and forth i don't

453
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:51,040
think that this is critically a critical

454
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,760
change to the protocol but it bothers me

455
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,240
that we have this

456
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:55,360
non-deterministic uh element going on

457
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,440
and i'm going to go up

458
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,839
past this point right now another

459
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:02,560
experiment thing is staff expertise

460
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:04,639
out there i've seen it where i wanted my

461
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,680
operator to have much simpler tools to

462
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:07,440
use i want the pro

463
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,800
the software they use to be simpler they

464
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,160
don't need to understand the protocol we

465
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,120
can't afford to teach them the protocol

466
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,560
anymore

467
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,240
we keep bringing more people in to

468
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,839
people turning over they want to know

469
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:18,000
how to make things work

470
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:19,440
things are things working out there this

471
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,880
puts pressure on the tool makers to make

472
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,120
sure the tooling is

473
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,959
there it's in it's uh in place and it's

474
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,240
simple

475
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:28,319
uh so are the gaps here protocol

476
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,959
engineers describe the way software can

477
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,320
be written

478
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:32,959
they like functionality like to make

479
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:34,480
things do more things

480
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:36,079
but i find that sometimes they tend to

481
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,399
lose sight of what's in operations and

482
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:38,560
what

483
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:40,000
what the tool makers have to do excuse

484
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:42,479
me operators

485
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,279
um opera operators are interesting

486
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,720
because they

487
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:45,760
they have a job to do that doesn't

488
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,959
matter what they're doing they have to

489
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,399
do a job they have to make sure things

490
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:50,560
don't fall apart

491
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:52,079
i work i met with a group of people who

492
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,359
are new operators came in to run an

493
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:54,719
organization

494
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,720
they know how to do opera they can

495
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,440
operate anything a bus line a ticket

496
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,240
agency

497
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,920
now they're running a dns thing um but

498
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,720
they're mystified because the protocol

499
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,399
really hasn't

500
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,760
been it wasn't running the way they

501
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:07,120
thought it would go

502
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:09,040
what this does a lot of operators will

503
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:12,480
lead on package software

504
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:14,000
to do this defaults and all that um

505
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,279
now the software developers and you know

506
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,160
i'm assuming a lot of people in this

507
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:17,120
room are more

508
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,959
uh interested in the software

509
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,440
development process caught in the middle

510
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:23,119
of this

511
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:24,959
and the bret brett i'm sorry huber's

512
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:27,199
camel talk if you haven't seen that this

513
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:28,479
is a link to his saying that what straw

514
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:30,079
is going to break the camel's back when

515
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:33,199
i keep getting demands for more and more

516
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:34,079
uh features on my dns software uh this

517
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:35,758
is what i'm

518
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:37,199
really concerned that this is doing is

519
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:40,560
making this camel

520
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:41,839
getting closer to the edge so it's a

521
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,040
classic devops issue

522
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:44,880
maximize functionality versus to

523
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:46,880
minimize downtime um

524
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:48,639
so what do you do about this um this is

525
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,360
kind of this is what i'm my message here

526
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:51,199
is

527
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,399
i want to encourage folks in this room

528
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:54,639
to uh

529
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:55,680
get involved with the with the ietf

530
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:57,120
process

531
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,399
um i was told that where were you when

532
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,839
this document was being written i said

533
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:02,320
well i was actually there and i

534
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:03,440
kind of got tired of it um but people

535
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,399
have to go in and say is this

536
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,839
implementable

537
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:08,000
is backwards compatibility always

538
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:10,000
desirable do we have to get rid of some

539
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,040
old features and say you know it also

540
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,639
has got to break because we

541
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:14,959
we don't doesn't matter shouldn't be

542
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:15,199
there uh can it be implemented that's

543
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:16,880
what

544
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:18,240
needs people need to have an eye on that

545
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,360
when they go to these organizations that

546
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,680
run the protocol development

547
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:23,839
that's my basic uh message here for

548
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:25,199
folks

549
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:26,399
you know if if you're if you're not

550
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:28,160
doing this what i fear is we're gonna

551
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:29,600
have to have more dns flag days

552
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,719
at some point we get rid of features or

553
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,920
features conflicting with each other we

554
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,839
need to have more

555
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:36,319
input to the process to to make sure

556
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:38,720
that we don't say in this document

557
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:40,639
we're going to let any be minimized the

558
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,320
response coming back is going to be

559
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:43,759
this you want to have the like one

560
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,560
record you want to have one thing come

561
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:46,720
back saying

562
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,839
if you see this stop asking for any more

563
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,639
information assume you're not going to

564
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:49,920
get any

565
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:52,160
and fall back to whatever you need to

566
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:55,360
get your information and that's uh

567
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:56,160
my basic message for for the uh this

568
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:59,040
talk here

569
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:00,000
so i have an email my email isn't in the

570
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,920
slides if you have

571
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,800
if you want to ask me about this you ask

572
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,800
me now i guess too

573
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:09,599
so i'm done thanks

574
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:16,079
thank you any questions for adverts

575
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:19,839
shane

576
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:26,240
yeah this is shane it's not really a

577
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:29,120
question it's more of a comment sure

578
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:29,600
i mean we we all know that you can't

579
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:32,719
really

580
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:34,719
trust any queries for anything

581
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,559
so it's already kind of performance art

582
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,799
right it's like you go to a play

583
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:39,918
and the writer's trying to say something

584
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:40,960
and the actors are trying to say

585
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:41,520
something the directors are trying to

586
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,960
say

587
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,720
and you have to interpret what you get

588
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,640
back and it's

589
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,240
it can be enjoyable but don't treat it

590
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,799
as as science

591
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:52,240
well you're all right yeah so this is

592
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:54,720
part of the conversation i had with with

593
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:57,200
the the people who wrote the document

594
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,799
for for what i've been doing i have i

595
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,000
have a use for it it's not about my use

596
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:02,720
for it my use for it actually

597
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,400
it that works perfect um because i'm

598
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:07,440
asking a specific question of a specific

599
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:08,640
small population um

600
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,960
i don't deserve to do that in fact my

601
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:12,160
code is for years how it had fallback to

602
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,320
ask for everything you expect to see

603
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:16,640
there anyway it's just more efficient

604
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:17,600
um and yeah but i mean this is i don't

605
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,200
think the any query

606
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,959
it's not that i'm i want the any query

607
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,160
to survive don't get me wrong i don't

608
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:24,240
want to survive

609
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,760
i want to be clearer that you're not

610
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,440
doing it

611
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:29,360
that's what i'm after that was in when

612
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:31,840
those this time was being discussed

613
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,559
um i first was comp uh here to eight the

614
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,918
h info

615
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:35,918
option was the first one out there and i

616
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:36,799
thought well you know we don't like to

617
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:38,480
reuse

618
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:40,559
what create a new record type oh it'll

619
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:42,320
take 20 years for that to roll out right

620
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:43,840
um this is what i'm after we want to

621
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,879
make sure that we do changes to the

622
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,799
protocol

623
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,320
so that's sustainable so that we you

624
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:50,480
know maybe we

625
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:51,840
you know because well i i understand the

626
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,919
discussion that went on too

627
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:55,439
well what about the case where someone

628
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:57,520
was relying on it and we shouldn't take

629
00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:00,799
it away from them unnecessarily so maybe

630
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:02,960
we'll do some get is that worth i mean

631
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:04,799
is it is it worth is that something we

632
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:06,400
can keep doing because that's part of

633
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:08,879
the straws in the camel

634
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:10,320
you know that so that's the thing if i

635
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,520
think if people here felt strongly

636
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:13,678
enough that changed

637
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:15,200
don't don't fight this one if a change

638
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:16,320
is coming along the ietf and it's going

639
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,320
to change the code in a way that makes

640
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:20,000
the code blowed up big

641
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:21,760
go to the itf and let them know this is

642
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,640
not implementable and that's what i'm

643
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:25,039
asking

644
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,039
what's up

645
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:34,320
another question so i presume in your

646
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:36,000
analysis you used you used non-recursive

647
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:37,918
queries

648
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,520
what about the recursive ones and what

649
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:40,799
is the role of a dns cache server in

650
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:42,559
that respect because uh

651
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:43,840
when i i was trying to implement or

652
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:46,559
implement the last version

653
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:47,678
of djib dns curve i also was uh had to

654
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,639
take the decision what to do with the

655
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:51,520
any ones here

656
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:54,160
so that's uh yeah that's all of it yet

657
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:57,200
yeah i mean

658
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:59,520
you know well it's a good question i

659
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:01,360
mean i in my in my work i always go

660
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,639
to the authority of servers that's

661
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:04,240
because i'm grafting off a code that

662
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,280
does that i didn't do recursive

663
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:08,000
what's a good question what's your

664
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:09,760
recursive server come back with um

665
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,280
you know and i'd if i told you i'd be

666
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:13,679
thinking about my feed but

667
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,320
obviously you know there are a coup the

668
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:16,480
problem is i

669
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:17,840
like my first reaction was not imp not

670
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,840
implemented r code

671
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:21,439
but if that happens some folks go into

672
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:23,039
tizzy about that and keep asking other

673
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:25,280
servers now to see if they do it

674
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:26,320
nothing is for non-implemented op codes

675
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:30,399
right they say

676
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:31,439
right yeah so uh yeah so we

677
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,720
maybe that's part of the problem we

678
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,720
don't have the protocol doesn't have

679
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:37,039
enough definitive like

680
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:39,039
this this is a there's zone level errors

681
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:41,039
and there's server level errors right

682
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:42,480
the server's not going to respond to you

683
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:45,600
go somewhere else

684
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:46,000
but when the zone is out we need to tell

685
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,639
stop

686
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,280
asking i've seen meltdown so many ways i

687
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,799
mean it's not

688
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:52,480
uncommon to a lot of people out there

689
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:53,760
but for recursive service out there i

690
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,039
mean i just haven't thought i've i've

691
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,840
never worked in recursive service field

692
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:58,879
so i haven't thought of it

693
00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:00,158
honestly yeah that should actually that

694
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:02,400
would actually be

695
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:03,919
part of what is in here because i think

696
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,280
the people who wrote this were thinking

697
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:06,320
is authoritative servers too come to

698
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,918
think of it because i don't see

699
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:10,639
recursive in there at all

700
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:11,200
and i do know uh who they were you know

701
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,520
the working

702
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:15,200
cloud flare was uh obviously um and they

703
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,480
were trying to solve some problems also

704
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,960
beyond the ones i was just putting out

705
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:19,200
there

706
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:21,200
i suspect but i'll just leave it at that

707
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:24,000
so

708
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,000
any other questions

709
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:31,840
okay thank you

710
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:41,760
this concludes the dns dev room in about

711
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:44,000
30 minutes the web performance dev room

712
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:46,000
will start here

713
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,159
i will stick around for a bit bet some

714
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,760
others will so if you have any questions

715
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:59,840
