1
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,920
yes

2
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:11,360
hello and hello again to some of you

3
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,240
because as this part of the slide says

4
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,000
my name is steve

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,920
and as that part of the slide says i'm a

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,279
bit of a geek if we've all turned up to

7
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,800
the right room i'm going to be talking

8
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:20,400
about how i can post the symphony with

9
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:23,840
javascript

10
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:25,198
now it's not the react talk if you were

11
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,880
wondering

12
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:28,840
my react talk would basically be it

13
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:32,879
sucks but you get a job

14
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:34,480
end this how many of them did i divide

15
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:38,399
with that comment

16
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:39,839
i'm only a couple not so bad okay so

17
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,520
simply number one because i've only

18
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,200
written one

19
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,039
and i kind of like the old traditional

20
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,960
way of doing things so over the course

21
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:48,719
of the next 20-25 minutes

22
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,440
i'm going to be talking about that

23
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,239
symphony the origins of it its creation

24
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,079
process

25
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:55,360
and the other stuff that sort of went

26
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:58,399
along with it

27
00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:01,359
um it's

28
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:02,399
quite old i started this way back in the

29
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:03,359
90s

30
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:05,040
there were probably some of you that

31
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:06,000
weren't even born in the 90s it's that

32
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,479
long ago

33
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,040
so in 1996 and i had to look this up for

34
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:12,320
my own

35
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:14,080
records i was reading a book uh those

36
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:16,559
are the paper things by the way

37
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,280
and there was this comment in there

38
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,640
about

39
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:22,640
a composer called george legetti and

40
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,080
there was a thing that he'd written

41
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,400
which was fairly modern

42
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:29,840
and it was a hundred metronomes all

43
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:33,840
ticking at a slightly different tempo

44
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:35,600
and i thought that's quite interesting

45
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,520
not because musically it might be

46
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:40,240
interesting but the idea

47
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:42,000
that you just have ran seemingly random

48
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:44,880
events coming from metronomes of them

49
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,680
going into sequence and coming out again

50
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:49,920
i thought i wonder what that sounds like

51
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52,399
that must be quite interesting now to

52
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:55,439
also give some context of 1996

53
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:57,280
um amazon wasn't that it was one year

54
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:59,199
old and only sold books

55
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,439
so not going to be able to get this

56
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:04,320
recording of george legetti that way

57
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:05,199
ebay was a year old google was nowhere

58
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,119
near and

59
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,640
youtube still nine years away now if you

60
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:10,639
want to get some music you just go to

61
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:14,079
youtube it's pretty much all there

62
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:17,440
but this poem symphonic was not there

63
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:18,720
it was also not in my local library i

64
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,400
grew up in a place in the middle of

65
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,239
nowhere where the local library had

66
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,840
cassette tapes and not much else

67
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:27,200
and certainly would not have george

68
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:30,319
legetti so i had no choice

69
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,879
i'd have to play it myself but i'm not

70
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:33,359
in the

71
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:36,000
general idea of i will just go to the

72
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,440
music shop and buy 100 metronomes that

73
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,000
was a bit

74
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:45,840
too much but i had an idea

75
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,760
i just code it myself which i did

76
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:50,080
i wrote a midi library the first one was

77
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,959
in c the later one is in javascript and

78
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,680
i just

79
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:55,120
went away line by line by line and wrote

80
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,840
it

81
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:59,360
sounded awful completely not a waste of

82
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,959
time

83
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:05,280
but it did give me an idea

84
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:08,080
this is what he came up with in the 60s

85
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:11,200
it's the 60s modernist composition

86
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:14,720
he's he had metronomes he could do that

87
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:17,518
but i thought i have a computer

88
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,319
i'm not limited to whatever a little box

89
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,599
of wood

90
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:23,440
will tick i can generate notes i can

91
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:26,480
change these notes

92
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:28,079
i can do anything i want so

93
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,079
the first idea i had was not very

94
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:33,599
original to be honest

95
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:36,720
and it was this i started off i had

96
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:39,920
one note in a bar i then

97
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:43,120
put two notes in a bar i then put

98
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:46,559
you can see this is going right

99
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:48,959
um does anyone want to guess on how far

100
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:52,159
i pushed this joke

101
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:53,760
up to 32 beats in a bar and i thought

102
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:55,519
okay

103
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,599
this will be one note this will be

104
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:59,360
another note maybe a third or a fifth

105
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:02,879
higher this with the note maybe a

106
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:04,400
seventh up an octave up and so forth

107
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:06,079
i'll use a piano because that's a nice

108
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,720
simple instrument it's got the range

109
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,400
whereas

110
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,920
a lot of other instruments in the

111
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,519
orchestra have got this only sort of two

112
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,238
octave range i wanted a big range

113
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:15,599
because i wanted

114
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:19,440
32 notes playing simultaneously

115
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:21,918
and i wrote the code i put this in and

116
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,680
it didn't sound awful i'll play you an

117
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:27,840
excerpt

118
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:43,840
if i can remember what i called it um

119
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:43,840
that one i think

120
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:56,620
[Music]

121
00:04:54,400 --> 00:05:00,638
you get the idea

122
00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:02,240
[Music]

123
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:04,240
yes it i don't think britney's got

124
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,560
anything to worry about but

125
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,000
for me it was like this would not have

126
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,000
been possible

127
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,080
back in the day it's only possible

128
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,120
because the machine is precise enough

129
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:17,758
to be able to play 31 notes in a bar

130
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,600
and get every single one of them correct

131
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:20,880
as a musician you can generally play 32

132
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,360
because you're used to that

133
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,400
you're used to playing twos threes fours

134
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:28,000
sometimes fives

135
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:30,638
but 31 for a human is almost impossible

136
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,080
so the machine was the only way to do it

137
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:33,360
but it's as you can hear it's quite

138
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:36,000
funky it's

139
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,039
not very interesting so i added two bits

140
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,280
to this

141
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:40,719
i slowed it down so over time it gets

142
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:43,679
slower and slower

143
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:45,039
and i created a morph so it starts off

144
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:49,360
as a piano

145
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:49,360
and it ends as a harp so if i fast

146
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:55,280
forward

147
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:59,199
just that quite sort of dreamy sort of

148
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:59,198
sensation kind of a sound

149
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,199
but because it changes gradually over

150
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,520
time you don't

151
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:06,880
obviously notice something's happening

152
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,400
and again this is something i was only

153
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,400
able to do with the machine

154
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:13,359
by making very slight adjustments to the

155
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:14,880
sound every time programmatically

156
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:20,960
if you want to see some code i might

157
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:24,479
even have some

158
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:27,280
ah not yet i've got some code later

159
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:28,560
so that that was the first idea i added

160
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,239
a few tweaks to it

161
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,240
and it's the whole rule i'm sure most of

162
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,400
you have heard the rule that uh

163
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,240
most of work especially creative work is

164
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,080
90 inspiration and 10

165
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,680
perspiration and that's exactly the way

166
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,919
it should be right when

167
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,600
unfortunately you spend all your time

168
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:44,318
just faffing around trying to get things

169
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,440
right

170
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:51,440
not that original 10 of inspiration

171
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:53,599
so we listened to it uh so i i wrote it

172
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,719
i it came out my midi and i thought

173
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:57,599
right

174
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:59,680
that's okay not gonna break any world

175
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:02,319
records but it's okay

176
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,919
then i thought well what else can i do

177
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:06,319
essentially all i'm doing is creating

178
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:10,159
asynchronous rhythms

179
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:10,160
what else can i do that's asynchronous

180
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:15,039
if you want the code that's that's the

181
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,719
code so i started thinking of other

182
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:17,840
things and coming up with other ideas

183
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,759
because i've got the code now i've

184
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:21,119
written this library i might as well use

185
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:23,280
it

186
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,880
and i'd always had a fascination with

187
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:28,318
fractals

188
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:31,440
self-similar images usually

189
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:32,800
which at one level look the same and at

190
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:35,520
a slightly deeper level

191
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,319
also look the same so i thought is this

192
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,198
possible

193
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:40,080
with a composition can i have a melody

194
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:42,400
line

195
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,758
that goes from here to here but if you

196
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:46,318
take every other note

197
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:48,240
it plays the same melody line and then

198
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:49,919
you take every other note from that

199
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,440
and it produces another melody which is

200
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:54,080
the same as the original

201
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:55,919
just half as long and the answer is yes

202
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:57,758
you can

203
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:59,840
and if you do that you do it

204
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:02,160
programmatically and then you double the

205
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:04,719
length of each note

206
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,759
i wrote this and it lasted a minute and

207
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,440
i thought it's never gonna get into the

208
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:10,960
pop charts unless it's four minutes

209
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:12,000
so i repeated it four times steve reich

210
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:15,039
has taught me well

211
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,479
as of philip glass so i told you there'd

212
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:20,000
be music jokes i just didn't tell you

213
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:20,000
there would be funny music jokes

214
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:24,560
so i've repeated it four times i offset

215
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,199
the starting note by a semi-quaver every

216
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,280
time

217
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:29,759
so that the notes would fall into very

218
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:32,000
slightly different places

219
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:40,340
regenerated it and it sounds something

220
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:49,110
like this

221
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:49,110
[Music]

222
00:08:52,839 --> 00:09:06,399
do

223
00:08:54,060 --> 00:09:06,399
[Music]

224
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:12,959
so

225
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:14,959
[Music]

226
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:17,040
and the symbol is there to sort of just

227
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:19,518
remind me when one bit stops and the

228
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:23,599
next bit starts up

229
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:25,360
it was not artistic

230
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,720
but of course when you start getting

231
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,760
these ideas and you've got that

232
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,320
technology at hand

233
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:32,160
every single problem says okay i'm going

234
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,640
to solve it with this tool

235
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:36,880
so i started doing more things on the

236
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,720
idea of asynchronous rhythms

237
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:41,920
okay i'll show you some code while i do

238
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,920
that so there's some code

239
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,239
i did change it slightly from the

240
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:47,680
original it originally was vars i've

241
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,399
changed it to let's because that's more

242
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:51,359
common

243
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:53,360
but my yeah open office just puts

244
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,120
capitals in there instead nowadays but

245
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:57,519
that's okay you can see it is really

246
00:09:55,120 --> 00:10:00,720
simple you can create files

247
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:02,640
with the library you sync up the tracks

248
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,640
because you're using time as i was

249
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:06,399
talking about in the midi web midi talk

250
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:08,079
earlier on

251
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:10,480
midi itself doesn't really have the

252
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:11,359
concept of time the time it has is real

253
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,440
world time

254
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,040
you send a note message you wait the

255
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,800
right amount of real world time and then

256
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:19,120
send the note off message

257
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,399
in a file you have to store that as a

258
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:23,040
difference in time

259
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:24,000
however many pulses per quarter note and

260
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,760
that number

261
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,440
will vary on each track so you have to

262
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,640
then re-sync them up so everything's

263
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,320
level

264
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:33,839
but otherwise it's just a case of adding

265
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,839
notes adding notes and adding notes

266
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,680
and that's what one of the things looks

267
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:38,640
like it's not very interesting i'm

268
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,839
afraid

269
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,079
but it's music it's meant to be listened

270
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:46,320
to apparently

271
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:49,920
so midi and web media especially

272
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:51,440
does not have sound might seem weird for

273
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:53,279
a sound library to have but

274
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,800
really doesn't have sound it just has

275
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:55,519
the indication that there should be a

276
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,760
sound

277
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:59,519
the midi fire will say i want a piano

278
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:01,439
here i want a violin there

279
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:03,680
it doesn't tell them how the piano

280
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,360
should sound doesn't say how the violin

281
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:07,439
should sound or what type of violin

282
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:09,760
or even if it's being plucked or bowed

283
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:13,200
just we want a violin

284
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:13,200
so all of this has to be realized

285
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:16,959
and for that you need synthesizers which

286
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:19,360
i didn't bring because

287
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:21,920
so i just bought this as an example that

288
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:24,480
i can play a little bit

289
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:26,800
so the process is actually quite simple

290
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,079
and it's what you'd probably expect

291
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:30,800
you get the javascript to create the

292
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:34,399
midi file you listen to it in my case i

293
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:36,079
used cakewalk which is now defunct

294
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:37,600
you listen through it you think i don't

295
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:39,439
like the notes or there are too many

296
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:42,560
notes clustering up here

297
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:44,160
i'll put this octave above

298
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,920
oh i don't like the speed i'll slow it

299
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,680
down speed it up

300
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:49,760
because all the time every single one of

301
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:51,439
these is an experiment

302
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,959
there is no way of being able to predict

303
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,839
ahead of time what it's going to sound

304
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:56,000
like and if it's even going to sound any

305
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:58,560
good

306
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,800
so load it up listen to it and then this

307
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:03,920
is where the human part comes in

308
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:06,000
do i like it do i see something in there

309
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:07,519
and a number of times i didn't i

310
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,040
listened back and i thought i've just

311
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:10,959
wasted my evening

312
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:12,399
there's nothing in there but every now

313
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:12,880
and again something will come up it's

314
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:15,279
like

315
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:17,360
i didn't expect that let me explore that

316
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:19,920
a bit further

317
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,600
um there's always tricks and it does

318
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:24,800
feel sometimes that it is a little bit

319
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,920
of a trickster thing composing like this

320
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,920
as it probably would if you were doing

321
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,439
it with ai is that

322
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:31,040
if you don't like that thing you just

323
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,639
keep changing the parameters until it

324
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:35,199
does sound good

325
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:36,880
there is no real way of with algorithmic

326
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:39,120
music that i've found yet

327
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:40,079
that you can just say i know this will

328
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,880
be good if i

329
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:43,199
just do that it's always the case of

330
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,120
just

331
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,399
twiddling everything you can until

332
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,839
either you get fed up and you're

333
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:50,880
convinced there's nothing there

334
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:52,000
or it sounds reasonably good once you've

335
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,120
done that you decide what

336
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,480
sounds you're going to have on it is it

337
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,440
going to be the piano to harp thing is

338
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,600
it going to be a lot of

339
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,720
uh orchestral stuff i did do a bit with

340
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,880
a choir in it

341
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,320
and then you record it and that's it

342
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,760
that's pretty much it done

343
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:06,079
i had some other ideas i created the

344
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:09,200
factor one as i mentioned earlier

345
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:10,399
i also tried a thing with volume because

346
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,440
you're able to change all these

347
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:13,760
parameters

348
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,720
you can just play one chord for the

349
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,399
entire piece

350
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,399
and change the volume of those

351
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:20,880
individual notes

352
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:22,560
i got the idea from jean-michel waiting

353
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:25,600
for cousteau

354
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:26,079
which was basically a 45-minute piece

355
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,200
with

356
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:30,638
two sounds in it i thought if he can get

357
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:35,839
away with it

358
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:35,839
and i think it's that one

359
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:45,439
[Music]

360
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,000
those extra random i think it's a not

361
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,519
sitar

362
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,519
uh guitar playing over the top

363
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:53,360
they're just random bits i put in there

364
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:56,320
but they're only random

365
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:57,279
if you have no idea who i am if you know

366
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,639
who i am

367
00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:00,480
then you'll know every important event

368
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:01,120
in my life and you'll know that i've

369
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:04,079
transcribed

370
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:05,279
my biorhythms which are apparently true

371
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:08,000
science

372
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:09,120
of my emotional state my physical and my

373
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
is it mental the

374
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:13,199
three biorhythms which uh cadence in 28

375
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,920
day 31 day

376
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:18,160
25 day cycles so whenever those things

377
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:20,079
coincide and things happen in my life

378
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:22,240
i made a note of them and those notes

379
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:24,800
are triggered at that part

380
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,800
of the song

381
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,800
but all intents and purposes it's sort

382
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:32,399
of ambient

383
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:35,920
mood music and i also did do an

384
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:35,920
hour-long version of that one as well

385
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:40,160
i also introduced it with this as well

386
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:45,839
so i thought it'd be quite fun

387
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:45,839
so let's board

388
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:50,560
[Music]

389
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:51,199
again this this section is all just one

390
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:54,319
chord

391
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:54,880
which is c sharp minor and the volume of

392
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,560
each

393
00:14:54,880 --> 00:15:00,160
note in that chord is going up and down

394
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:00,160
gradually in and out of phase

395
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,310
and that's the tingle effect that says

396
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,750
that was probably my birthday

397
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:07,888
[Music]

398
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:07,889
[Applause]

399
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:13,439
is biorhythm still a thing do people

400
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:15,199
still do biorhythms

401
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:17,360
when i was younger and learning to code

402
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:19,120
every programming book i ever got

403
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:21,040
seemed to have an example on how to draw

404
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,399
biorhythms because they're very simple

405
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,160
to render it's just a couple of sine

406
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:26,480
waves

407
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:28,079
so my general thing has been to start

408
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,839
simple and then get esoteric

409
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:32,079
you'll see some extra ideas you'll hear

410
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:33,920
something go i'm going to try that

411
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:35,599
it's all emergent you never know what's

412
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:37,120
coming out the end so all you need to do

413
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:40,000
is add a nice introduction to something

414
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:41,440
and then add a nice ending

415
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,440
that's another one of those examples

416
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:45,759
which is badly formatted so i won't

417
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,759
linger

418
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:50,079
yeah i tried doing a scale so just one

419
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:53,120
normal scale from c to c

420
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:55,199
and repeat it very quickly

421
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,720
broken melodies where i start all the

422
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:58,240
notes at the same time and then

423
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,240
gradually i move them off

424
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,920
of that time which is another thing

425
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,320
which is very difficult for humans to

426
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,759
play

427
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,279
you naturally will not follow in with

428
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:05,839
the same beat that everyone else is

429
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:08,079
going

430
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:10,079
so when you have to play it just a

431
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:11,120
fraction of a second later or a fraction

432
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:13,120
a second before

433
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,320
it's very difficult to do it so it's

434
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,320
another one of these things where the

435
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:20,240
machine is pretty much the only machine

436
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:22,399
the only way of performing these pieces

437
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,440
so i'd written it i'd recorded the demo

438
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:25,839
at home

439
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,480
but i didn't have very nice synthesizers

440
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:28,320
so i

441
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,839
found a recording studio uh in north

442
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:32,560
london where i used to live

443
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:34,240
and got it recorded properly also had to

444
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:36,000
get it mastered

445
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,839
now recording things in a studio is easy

446
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,519
that's fine you just pay the money

447
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:41,120
and the engineers tweak all the knobs to

448
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:42,560
make sure it works well

449
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,320
uh mastering is another thing where you

450
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:46,638
just have to give them money

451
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:48,639
but this thing that sounds good on your

452
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:50,320
headphones will sound different on my

453
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:51,440
headphones to sound different coming out

454
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,360
speakers at home

455
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:55,360
to the recording studio speakers and to

456
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,079
your machine so there's a process called

457
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,600
mastering

458
00:16:56,079 --> 00:17:00,000
which all professional recordings go

459
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,360
through so it sounds good in any format

460
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,560
and that's just another expense

461
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:05,439
basically people sit there with

462
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:07,119
computers and twiddle dials

463
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:09,120
and i have no idea what's doing all that

464
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:10,639
and i

465
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:12,559
and i and you get make sure you get the

466
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:16,880
lossless versions of everything because

467
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:19,839
mp3 is awful and we're finished

468
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:21,120
almost i still after doing all this i

469
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:24,079
still had to come up with a

470
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:25,119
cover for the the the album and this is

471
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:27,438
what i came up with

472
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:28,239
simple enough uh steve my stage name for

473
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:30,080
music

474
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:32,480
symphony number one and a load of

475
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:36,080
computer screens which are

476
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:39,200
the the full color pattern is in octal

477
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:41,199
anyone here counting optical you will

478
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,559
now

479
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,080
least significant bit on that side most

480
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:44,639
significant there goes from greater

481
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:47,199
white

482
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:48,640
to yellow to black or dark and then

483
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:51,919
again

484
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:54,799
all the way through this was also

485
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:56,559
generated in javascript

486
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:58,480
i found an image which was a little

487
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:59,918
piece of clipart like that

488
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,760
and i rendered the whole thing out and i

489
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:05,520
think it's about 2 000

490
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:07,679
by 2000 png i have no idea what the

491
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:09,760
source for that bit is however

492
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:11,520
i then had to create a biography myself

493
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:13,120
i've never had to do that as a musician

494
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,240
before

495
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:16,479
so you have to go through and you've got

496
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:18,559
to write nice little snappy things about

497
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,919
why you are very good composer and why

498
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:22,000
people should listen to you

499
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:23,840
so you have to make up a load of guff

500
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,559
basically

501
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:27,760
oh and you need a photograph i don't

502
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:29,600
photograph well there's only two

503
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:33,440
pictures of me in existence that i like

504
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:35,600
and believe it or not that's one of them

505
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:37,200
so you've got to sort of go you you

506
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,879
think that doing the music is the sort

507
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,480
of the end of the journey it's fast and

508
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,799
then it starts getting hard work and

509
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,559
you've

510
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:44,559
got to start promoting it you've got to

511
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:46,000
start writing tracks now

512
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:48,080
because these are quite experimental

513
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,600
things just listening to it you probably

514
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:52,080
won't know what's going on

515
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:55,439
so i had to write a full page about each

516
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:57,120
piece explaining the process that i

517
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,400
i was doing create some low quality mp3s

518
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,760
with some watermarks in so i could put

519
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,039
it on a few dodgy sites

520
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:03,840
i had to create the high quality ones

521
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:06,240
for apple uh but um oh and and putting

522
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:07,918
them in order

523
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,280
the order i came up with is not the

524
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:10,799
order that they're in the album

525
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:12,879
the order in the album is ones that i

526
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:14,559
thought worked best with shorter tracks

527
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,400
than longer tracks and a kind of an

528
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:18,320
actual sort of ebb and flow to it

529
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,600
but i've probably still got it wrong and

530
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:21,280
this is the sort of track information i

531
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:23,199
mean i had to write

532
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:25,840
yeah i was not kidding it it is

533
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,840
computery

534
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:30,160
so after all this i still had to release

535
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,320
it

536
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,440
so it's available on apple and bandcamp

537
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:35,120
i would say

538
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,480
go and get it from bandcamp if you want

539
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:38,399
to listen to it

540
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,400
because i'd rather get no money than

541
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:43,440
apple get some i think i guess

542
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:46,240
so conclusions are it's 10

543
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,960
inspiration 90 perspiration but i found

544
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,799
for this

545
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,000
it's one percent because there are so

546
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:52,320
many

547
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,160
false avenues you start going down one

548
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:55,678
way so often you just turn back and go

549
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:57,120
this is just not working i have to try

550
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:58,480
something else

551
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:00,639
you'll learn arrangements which i've

552
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:03,200
never had to do before

553
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:04,320
music business is painful uh it's called

554
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,760
a business for a reason it's because

555
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,559
only people that like doing business are

556
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,799
in it

557
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:10,080
and that opening section of that piece

558
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:12,559
that has got the orchestra

559
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:13,439
uh tuning up i put one of my pieces on

560
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:15,120
youtube as

561
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:17,280
an example piece and they said you're

562
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:18,879
using samples

563
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:20,399
no it's an orchestra tuning up it's from

564
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:23,280
a sample library i own

565
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:24,640
but they still blocked it so i had to go

566
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:26,480
back and re-edit and do

567
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,919
more stuff and then obviously be

568
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,360
realistic about the stuff

569
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:31,360
i think it's the best symphony i've ever

570
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,840
written i mean of the one symphony i've

571
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:34,158
written it's the best symphony i've

572
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:36,240
written

573
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:38,400
but no one else is probably going to

574
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:40,320
think that so i i can't

575
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,840
go and think i've done it where's my

576
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:43,600
island which island shall i buy off

577
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:45,760
richard branson this time

578
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:47,439
realistically speaking there's only

579
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:49,919
about five people that do this stuff so

580
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:51,600
let me update my foster scorecard there

581
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:54,159
we go and i've probably got one minute

582
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,158
for questions

583
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:02,559
do i have one minute for questions

584
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:03,439
thanks for your talk do we have some

585
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:05,678
questions yeah

586
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,679
okay

587
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:16,799
uh have you tried making also music with

588
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:20,720
do you deep neural networks

589
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:24,158
and uh music with neural networks

590
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:26,400
not yet but if

591
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:28,559
you if there's a feedback form say steve

592
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:30,320
was very good and maybe next year

593
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:32,000
he'll have some neural nets it's the

594
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:33,918
thing i've seen i like the look of but

595
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,080
i've not tried it yet

596
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:37,120
uh what beer are you drinking what beer

597
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:41,280
this is waterloo

598
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:42,559
okay yeah

599
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:45,039
what do you think the advantage of

600
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:47,280
making music like this is

601
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:48,320
or ah what are the advantages why create

602
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,840
music like this

603
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:51,520
so why create music like this is

604
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:54,799
probably the easier question

605
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:55,520
to answer is because i can i had this

606
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:58,240
idea

607
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,799
i thought what does it sound like what

608
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,000
if i

609
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:01,600
this is the only way i'm going to hear

610
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,559
it no one else is going to do it unless

611
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:05,199
i do it

612
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:06,639
so i went away and did it maybe if i

613
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,440
waited long enough someone else probably

614
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:09,360
in this room

615
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,799
would have the same idea and then they'd

616
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:13,918
write that symphony for me

617
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:16,559
but because no one was i did it

618
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:18,159
the the first question of what are the

619
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:20,559
benefits of doing it this way

620
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:21,760
i don't know it's the only way i know of

621
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:23,520
making that music

622
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:26,480
because it is so precise the timing is

623
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:28,000
so accurate it has to be done this way

624
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:30,400
do you think you're expressing something

625
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,919
of yourself do i think i'm expressing

626
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:34,240
myself in this

627
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:34,960
yes but it might not be an emotional

628
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,400
expression

629
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:38,400
it might be the intellectual expression

630
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:39,760
of look how clever i am because i can

631
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,120
write this library and i can come up

632
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:42,879
with these clever ideas

633
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:44,239
there might not be an emotional thing

634
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:47,440
and you might not get any emotional

635
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:47,440
state from this type of music

636
00:22:51,200 --> 00:23:04,910
thanks everybody all done okay thanks

637
00:22:55,420 --> 00:23:04,910
[Applause]

638
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:09,120
again
