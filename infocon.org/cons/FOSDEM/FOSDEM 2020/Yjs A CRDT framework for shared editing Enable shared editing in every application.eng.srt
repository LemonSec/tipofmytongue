1
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:08,320
hello everybody i want to introduce you

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,920
kevin

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,799
yarns we will talk about a cdt crdt

4
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:17,920
framework for

5
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:17,920
shared editing given a warm welcome

6
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,439
thank you uh so yeah i'm kevin yarns

7
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:26,400
hello

8
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:29,519
first tim uh i'm a contractor web

9
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:32,719
developer mainly focusing on creating

10
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:33,920
collaborative applications and that's

11
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:35,840
what yjs is for

12
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,840
it is a framework designed to

13
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,000
specifically help you to design

14
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,760
to make collaborative applications or

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,440
make your existing application

16
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,440
collaborative but first what is

17
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,718
collaboration um

18
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,800
you're probably familiar with

19
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:51,120
collaborative text editing

20
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,559
collaborative drawing maybe i've seen

21
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,599
that a couple of times

22
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:57,599
i'm personally really invested into

23
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,280
collaborative whiteboarding like think

24
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,600
about meeting rooms multiple

25
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,280
people coming together working on the

26
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,920
same problem it really makes sense to

27
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,560
provide

28
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,960
tools that enable you to do all these

29
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,280
things

30
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,240
at the same time and so it really

31
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:14,000
enables you to

32
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:18,640
create stuff together all these creative

33
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:21,280
tasks like drawing um

34
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,960
like text editing and meeting rooms

35
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,600
these are best served

36
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:27,199
doing as a collaborative application you

37
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,679
would be really hindered if you

38
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,040
would use a git application to do

39
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,560
something like that because it's an

40
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,880
asynchronous

41
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,079
tool you really want to have real-time

42
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,079
shared editing

43
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:39,759
in many applications and this is what

44
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:42,000
yjs does

45
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:43,920
so what's the problem that you tries to

46
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,840
solve or does solve

47
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,960
it's automatic conflict resolution it's

48
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,119
kind of magic

49
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,479
so assume that two users are working on

50
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:52,320
the same document they have a text

51
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:54,079
document in this example

52
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,320
and both are inserting a character at

53
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:57,919
the same time at the same position

54
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,839
they first apply their change on their

55
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,439
own document and then they propagate the

56
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:05,520
change to the other fears

57
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:08,000
so what happens is this conflict that is

58
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,758
that occurs in this scenario here is

59
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,560
automatically resolved and the documents

60
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:13,760
are chained

61
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,879
us merged automatically it's kind of

62
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,280
magic so both

63
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:18,799
users will end up with the same document

64
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:22,400
and that's really important

65
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:24,560
in these kinds of applications

66
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,599
this is very much contrary to a git

67
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,480
application

68
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:29,119
uh so this is manual conflict resolution

69
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,720
very some

70
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,720
uh this is what you have in git two

71
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:35,599
users are doing something concurrently

72
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,480
uh working on different branches um and

73
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:38,799
then they merge

74
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,679
their stuff and they end up with emer

75
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,000
get conflict

76
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,720
and this is perfect in my opinion

77
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,640
because

78
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,319
a git application is an asynchronous

79
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,640
application and therefore

80
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:50,160
a lot of conflicts might occur that you

81
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:53,679
want to resolve

82
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:56,000
manually because well if you would just

83
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,080
automatically merge those changes

84
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,040
you would end up with weird stuff

85
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,680
basically

86
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,640
um and this is also a problem that

87
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,120
writer solves

88
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:06,640
think about offline editing so you have

89
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,200
a collaborative application

90
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:10,720
that is supposed to also work offline

91
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,119
you want to

92
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:15,120
be on a plane write a document and then

93
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,720
later sync those changes to the other

94
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,159
peers then you want to have manual

95
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,959
conflict resolution

96
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:21,359
and whiter is also a tool for you to do

97
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:25,280
that

98
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:28,400
so it's very much like it in a way

99
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:30,080
there are tons of existing solutions um

100
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,159
and there's the pattern there all these

101
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,200
existing solutions they solve exactly

102
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:35,280
one problem

103
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,958
they have their own editor

104
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,319
implementation that they want to make

105
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:41,599
collaborative or

106
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:42,879
their own diagramming solution drawing

107
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:43,920
applications that they want to make

108
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:45,920
collaborative

109
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:48,000
and there are so many existing tools

110
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:49,920
that do exactly that and they all have a

111
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,920
specific backend that you have to use

112
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,839
and integrate into your application

113
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,280
they don't wear peer-to-peer and where's

114
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,760
the fun if you don't

115
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:59,680
can implement a distributed application

116
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,359
with this framework right

117
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,200
you want to integrate this shared

118
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:05,200
editing solution

119
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,280
into your own environment maybe you work

120
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:09,679
at the company

121
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,120
with an existing communication protocol

122
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,159
already in place maybe you have

123
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,159
something like

124
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:16,079
websockets already set up you have a

125
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:18,639
specific database set up

126
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:20,959
and then you want to use your own tools

127
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:22,160
instead of relying on a separate server

128
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,680
implementation

129
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,000
and this is something that really

130
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:29,280
bothers me and something that i want to

131
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,960
solve with yjs i've been working on yjs

132
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,880
for six years now i've been here at

133
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,680
foster six years ago talking about the

134
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,840
same stuff

135
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:38,080
but now i was really ready to do all

136
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:41,198
these things that i'm talking about

137
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:42,159
uh yt's mission is really to provide a

138
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:44,560
solution

139
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,520
that is network agnostic it works with

140
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,120
all the existing

141
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,880
communication protocols that are out

142
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:52,160
there it works peer-to-peer

143
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:54,639
it works on the data on ipfs

144
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,240
it integrates into your own existing

145
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:58,720
environment it's really

146
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,919
awesome this is i named this network

147
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,600
agnostic because

148
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:03,520
it doesn't care what the underlying

149
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,039
communication technology is

150
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:07,280
furthermore i want to support all the

151
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:08,240
editors at this time i support five of

152
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:11,280
the most prominent

153
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:14,639
text editors switch text editors called

154
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:16,400
code editors and they're all they all

155
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:19,520
work in combination with yjs

156
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:22,880
but that's not the limit i want to do

157
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:25,280
make everything creative drawing and

158
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:27,120
maybe maybe even interfaces you can make

159
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,840
react state collaborative that's all

160
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,479
possible

161
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,039
with yjs and ygs gives you the benefit

162
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:33,520
that

163
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:34,960
it already solves all these complex um

164
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:37,280
things that happen in collaborative

165
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:39,599
applications for example

166
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:41,440
um shared under video it's a really

167
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:44,560
complex problem think about that

168
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:46,880
um i'm working on a document and i hit

169
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,800
undo i should not be able to undo the

170
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,880
changes that you created i should only

171
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:53,600
undo the changes that i did

172
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:55,199
and that's a huge problem it there's a

173
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,199
lot of state tracking involved and

174
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,800
that's the problem that your solves

175
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:00,800
and it gives you undue redo

176
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:03,280
collaborative shared

177
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:05,199
under radio in all your applications

178
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:07,840
just by using this framework

179
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:09,039
it solves the um it solves the problems

180
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,719
of propagating

181
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:12,318
the awareness information that is

182
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:15,199
information for example

183
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:17,199
who is currently online what are they uh

184
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:19,199
currently selecting in the text where's

185
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:20,720
their cursor what is their name

186
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,400
these are all problems that are solved

187
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:25,039
in yjs uh

188
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,318
yjs has many more features for example

189
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:28,479
it does versioning it does

190
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:30,319
change tracking you can track who

191
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:31,039
created which content this is very much

192
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:32,960
like

193
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:35,039
uh get blame if you want so you can

194
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:38,080
select the portion of text and find out

195
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:39,840
who created that specific text it does

196
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,120
offline editing really well

197
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,758
with all the problems that are

198
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:47,120
associated with offline editing

199
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:50,639
and merging offline content so

200
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:52,960
yeah pretty cool but yours itself

201
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:54,319
here it's just a really small cdt

202
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:57,359
implementation

203
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:59,120
um it is based on the idea that they are

204
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,039
share types that you can use to

205
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:04,880
manipulate data

206
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:07,919
a share type is very much like a

207
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:10,159
javascript type like the javascript

208
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:11,840
array or javascript map with the only

209
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,599
difference being that all the changes

210
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,919
that you do to these types

211
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:17,680
these share types are automatically

212
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:18,960
propagated to all the peers

213
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,800
that are out there and they're

214
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,400
automatically automatically merged and

215
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,560
you can

216
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,239
observe these types and see okay when

217
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,560
did they change what happened

218
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:30,479
and who did those changes you can do

219
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:33,199
transactions on these changes

220
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:34,960
uh this is how yjs tries to solve the

221
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:36,319
problem of designing a collaborative

222
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,479
application

223
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:39,360
and then there's a huge ecosystem of

224
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:42,719
modules

225
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:44,000
that work together with yjs i i put all

226
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,560
these modules into

227
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,759
three categories um and these are only

228
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,879
the modules that are

229
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:53,840
officially supported by ygs and

230
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:54,400
so they are the connectors basically

231
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,440
they are

232
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:59,198
all about how you connect and share your

233
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:01,120
data using different communication

234
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:02,080
protocols there are the persistence

235
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,479
adapters

236
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:06,318
that store the data in a database this

237
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:07,039
can be server side for example in level

238
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:10,080
db

239
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:12,159
or browser site or in indexeddb

240
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,199
and then there are the data bindings in

241
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:16,319
this case here only

242
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:17,120
editor bindings uh yj supports five

243
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:19,759
editors

244
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,560
um including pros mirror quill and

245
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:22,400
several code

246
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:25,280
editors and we are currently working on

247
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,080
an on integrating ygs in gutenberg which

248
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:29,440
is the official

249
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:31,039
editor of wordpress so

250
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:33,039
you probably know about that so it

251
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:34,159
really integrates well into all these

252
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:38,080
products

253
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:40,240
and i could talk hours for

254
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,839
each of these modules individually they

255
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,279
do a lot of stuff they allow you to

256
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:45,680
scale your application

257
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:48,480
and i do actually you can check out the

258
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,839
podcasts we created around yts

259
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,760
later at the slide there's a link to

260
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:53,519
that but

261
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:55,120
i want to pick out a few of these

262
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:58,160
modules individually

263
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,560
and give an example so there's y-index

264
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,880
db

265
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,599
in the persistence category which allows

266
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,760
you to store

267
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,600
all your document updates efficiently in

268
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:07,920
the in the browser database

269
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,600
indexeddb is a database that is

270
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,719
available in all your browsers in all

271
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,519
modern browsers

272
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,080
and yj why indexeddb stores document

273
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:15,760
updates

274
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,760
incrementally efficiently in the

275
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:20,480
database so the next time you

276
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:22,160
reload your page you will already have

277
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,920
the content there you don't need to

278
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,600
request it from a server it's already

279
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,760
there on your local computer

280
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:30,320
and it will immediately load up it's

281
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:32,480
really fast it also allows you to create

282
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,240
offline ready applications because if

283
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,240
your website is available offline for

284
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:39,279
example using service workers

285
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:41,040
you can create an offline ready

286
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:43,200
application

287
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:45,360
then there is and this is the coolest

288
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:47,600
connector from of them all in my opinion

289
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:50,160
then there's why webrtc

290
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,360
it's a really ambitious project of mine

291
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:54,719
so webrtc

292
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:56,560
is a well a protocol basically

293
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,160
that allows you to create a peer-to-peer

294
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:01,199
connection from one browser

295
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:04,000
to the other and why webrtc

296
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,959
is a method a framework to create a

297
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,680
completely

298
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:12,079
uh it's a method to create a

299
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:14,239
mesh network of web rtc connections of

300
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:16,319
many peer-to-peer connections

301
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,920
uh from browser to browser there is no

302
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,279
central server involved that does

303
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:21,599
conflict resolution

304
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:24,079
all of this works peer-to-peer of course

305
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:26,160
yjs also integrates into existing

306
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:27,760
projects for example the data protocol

307
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,640
this is something i'm currently working

308
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:32,240
on

309
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:35,439
also with them to make this happen

310
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:39,040
and uh yeah really excited about that

311
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:41,519
now it's demo time and i invite you to

312
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:43,439
not only trust what i say just go on

313
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:45,680
this website ygs.dev

314
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,959
its website i would be really happy if a

315
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:50,160
lot of people would show up

316
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:52,000
and we could try out this peer-to-peer

317
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,760
application with a lot of browsers and

318
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,160
mobile devices here

319
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:58,319
i'm going to say beforehand the fosdem

320
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:00,880
network is not the most reliable

321
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,720
but even if a lot of connections break

322
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:05,760
the webrtc network is

323
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:10,240
kind of a fault tolerant so

324
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:13,439
hey i think it might work okay um

325
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,760
i actually i'm going to use this so this

326
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,160
is

327
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:17,839
my website the yjs website there are a

328
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,959
couple of examples here many more

329
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:22,640
examples

330
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:24,560
uh available in ygs demos it's a

331
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:27,600
repository full of

332
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:30,719
ready-to-use examples and this website

333
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,680
is completely available offline so the

334
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,560
next time we

335
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:36,719
you reload this website all of the data

336
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:39,040
is already there

337
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,240
did nobody join or does it just not work

338
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:43,279
well

339
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:45,279
that's what happens in demos right you

340
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:47,360
gotta just gotta have to trust my word

341
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:51,200
on it but i have a backup solution for

342
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:51,920
this so if you can see other user

343
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,320
cursors

344
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:56,240
um it will work uh apparently the

345
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,560
network here is not strong enough

346
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:00,800
so um the idea here is and now i open

347
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:03,199
two browsers that you can

348
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:04,639
work collaboratively text you see me

349
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:07,040
typing on the left window

350
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:07,680
is having stuff on the right window and

351
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,240
all of this

352
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:12,079
of course works offline actually i'm

353
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:16,399
going to go in

354
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:19,920
this now that i have no network anymore

355
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:21,760
airplane mode i can reload this website

356
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,760
it will still work even i can see my

357
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:26,959
cursors here which is really cool

358
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:29,200
i think and it will sync even

359
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:30,160
while offline and cool thing here is you

360
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:33,680
can make

361
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:35,279
versions so i can create a version here

362
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,760
and see all the differences that were

363
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:38,320
happen

364
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:40,079
that was created by different users i

365
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,200
can highlight them by the user who

366
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:44,800
created them

367
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:46,639
and now think uh imagine me

368
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,079
writing a lot of content here while i'm

369
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:51,120
offline

370
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:53,279
and i go back

371
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,240
online and sync all my changes back to

372
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:56,880
you like

373
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,279
just imagine it would work what would

374
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:00,000
happen

375
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:02,000
is that there would be a strange mish of

376
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,200
weird words appearing on your side and

377
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,600
on my side

378
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,700
oh my god there are a lot of users holy

379
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,399


380
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:11,600
[Laughter]

381
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:13,839
oh it does work um

382
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:16,000
cool so it does work so now all my

383
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:17,440
changes are just synced back to you but

384
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,959
i want to know what happened what did

385
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,639
you create in the meantime since i

386
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:22,719
wasn't here

387
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:24,079
apparently some people just copy paste

388
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:27,200
the text and

389
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:28,638
inserted some content so um i can really

390
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,560
distinguish the users who

391
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:33,360
who did what what happened here and this

392
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:35,119
is really important in offline editing

393
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,639
and by the way this live tracks all the

394
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:39,040
changes that you make so

395
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:42,079
when you do an insertion here um i'm

396
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:43,760
going to see who did that

397
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:46,079
so yeah this is really important in

398
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:49,519
offline editing because

399
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:51,279
you want to be able to uh proofread the

400
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:53,120
changes that you did to your document

401
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:54,800
before you sync them to the other peers

402
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,920
and this is also something that ygs

403
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,479
allows you to do

404
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,599
it's all peer-to-peer offline this uses

405
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,399
why webrtc

406
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:04,320
this is the prosmar editor but as i said

407
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:06,880
it's not limited to one editor there are

408
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,959
several editors that ygs supports

409
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:12,480
and there's a drawing example and you

410
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:17,279
can color rate the fleet raw it's

411
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:20,800
it's have you guys draw something here

412
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:22,480
oh man okay it might be a bit

413
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:25,199
overwhelming i think there

414
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:27,279
oh there are a lot of fuses joining this

415
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:31,279
is basically my demo i would really much

416
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:34,480
like to have at least a few questions so

417
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:35,519

editing collaborative

423
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:48,279

interested in something like that

427
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:56,000
also we have tons of podcasts around yjs

428
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:57,279
and the ecosystem that we created around

429
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,480
this

430
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:02,079
