1
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:11,920
okay

2
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:11,920
hello everyone my name is roberto mora

3
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:17,279
thank you already i'm glad to be here uh

4
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,279
so today i will be the spokesperson for

5
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:21,680
myself but also other rebenex

6
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:22,320
with whom we we prepared this talk

7
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,119
together but

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,359
who couldn't join unfortunately so i

9
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:29,599
will talk about uh

10
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:30,240
interdisciplinarity multitasking and

11
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:32,238
what

12
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,680
working in interdisciplinary research

13
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:36,320
environments

14
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,120
does to decision making processes and

15
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,160
also

16
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:43,360
to open research tools development so

17
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:44,879
the context i'm speaking from is a lab

18
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:47,840
called the media lab of sunspot

19
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:49,440
which is a interdisciplinary laboratory

20
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,120
and which

21
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,559
explores the relationships between

22
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:56,559
digital technologies and

23
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:58,879
society so this lab is made by

24
00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:00,480
individuals who come from very different

25
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:01,718
backgrounds hence

26
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,760
the interdisciplinary

27
00:01:01,719 --> 00:01:07,280
interdisciplinarity

28
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:10,399
but this interdisciplinarity has two

29
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:12,640
stakes two scales so to speak because

30
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:16,400
also each individual

31
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:17,040
is himself or herself the spokesperson

32
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,400
for

33
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,200
a variety of cultures of intellectual

34
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,000
interests

35
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:26,960
uh and also offlines of expertise so

36
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,159
here is what these people look like

37
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:33,600
here is where audrey stands

38
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:35,680
and here is where i stand

39
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,360
so all of these people do things

40
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:40,560
together

41
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:44,560
and because our thanks to this diversity

42
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:46,880
they they have variegated activities

43
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,680
so they do social sciences inquiries of

44
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,880
course

45
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:53,200
but they also teach and produce tools

46
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,479
whether they be code libraries or of the

47
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,520
shelf

48
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:59,920
applications and often one person

49
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:01,600
is involved in more than one of these

50
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,360
activities

51
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,880
so they do these activities in a variety

52
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,040
of contexts

53
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:09,840
some of them are clearly and precisely

54
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,840
defined like collectively uh

55
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,040
research collectively funded research

56
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,000
projects

57
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:17,760
others like phd research for instance

58
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,239
are more open-ended and have

59
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:25,440
less defined boundaries and aims

60
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:28,560
so we built tools papers and experiments

61
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:31,120
for a variety of publics so

62
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,800
first our colleagues and fellow

63
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,040
researchers but also students

64
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:38,239
and several professional groups like

65
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,239
library specialists

66
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:44,079
all the activities we do are linked and

67
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,280
feed each other and this talk will be a

68
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,599
description of

69
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,200
how at medialab we cope with this

70
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:52,079
intertwining

71
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,920
it will focus on describing what are the

72
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,480
consequences and modalities

73
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,119
of doing things in the same place and

74
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:00,399
often

75
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,920
with the same persons underlying this

76
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,560
description i will make

77
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,839
is a methodological reflection for which

78
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,800
i hope to foster some

79
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,480
discussion uh which is the fact that we

80
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,920
all know methodologies coming from the

81
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,159
industry

82
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,280
and or software production culture like

83
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:18,399
agile methods

84
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,920
ux research ux design the difference

85
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,680
between proof of concept and the

86
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,679
production ready products

87
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,879
but my question is how do these

88
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,760
established methods

89
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:29,200
and labels dialogue with our specific

90
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,518
research context

91
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:33,119
so to do so the description will focus

92
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:35,920
on two nodes of

93
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,560
methodological tension and two sets of

94
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,000
practices

95
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,840
the first one will be the question of

96
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,760
writing in social sciences

97
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,120
and it will address the relationship

98
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:46,239
between prototypes and

99
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:48,400
products research and development or

100
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:50,000
what it means to be at the same time the

101
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:53,760
users and the makers

102
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,519
of the software positions we make

103
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,120
the second will be the question of

104
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:59,200
social inquiry on the web

105
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,239
and it will address decision making

106
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,958
processes

107
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:04,959
and the the and the question of how we

108
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:06,319
cope with the separation of concerns and

109
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:09,360
responsibilities

110
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:12,798
between individuals with within this um

111
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:14,879
this interdisciplinary context

112
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:16,798
so first we'll uh we'll look at how

113
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:18,639
tools making and experiments are

114
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:20,399
intertwined and how the mix of context

115
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:22,479
described before

116
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:24,320
allows to trace a complex interweaving

117
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:27,120
between inquiry practices

118
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:28,000
experimentation and open research tools

119
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,880
stabilization

120
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,199
so to speak so to situate this concern i

121
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,000
will

122
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:35,120
address the question of writing and

123
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,080
publishing in social

124
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,840
sciences which is my privileged area of

125
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:42,000
research and interests

126
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,919
so the past decade has been marked by a

127
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,400
lot of brilliant initiatives

128
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:48,080
technologies and tools that try to

129
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,320
establish new standards

130
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,359
to leverage digital digital technologies

131
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,840
in the service of

132
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,680
better editorial processes of

133
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,520
polymorphic publishing but also

134
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,280
sometimes to question what it means to

135
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:02,159
write digitally

136
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:03,599
as a social science researchers so in

137
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,360
that regard media lab has been

138
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,320
structured since

139
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,120
its inception 10 years ago by the

140
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,360
pedagogical

141
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,560
activity of what we call controversy

142
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,160
mapping

143
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,560
so controversy mapping is a specific

144
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,400
kind of sociological inquiry

145
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,240
which consists in describing the

146
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,840
different point of view and

147
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,639
as sake in a social technolo in a

148
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:27,758
socio-technical dispute

149
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:29,280
or controversy like for instance

150
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:30,960
and growth how to as you will see in the

151
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:34,400
example i will show

152
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:35,440
um and in these courses students are

153
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,638
asked to produce as

154
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:39,680
outcome of of their websites of their

155
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:42,720
research sorry

156
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:45,520
not reports not papers but websites

157
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,160
so why do we ask them that it's because

158
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,719
by using

159
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:51,360
hypertext they are allowed to express

160
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:54,080
the multiplicity of point of view

161
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:56,080
which controversy description requires

162
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,800
so first reason hypertext and the second

163
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,880
reason

164
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,080
is that it allows students to write

165
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:02,159
closer to

166
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:04,560
the inquiry documents that they use for

167
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:07,039
instance images interviews

168
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,919
official documents uh by staging them

169
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:11,120
directly

170
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:13,680
inside the websites so in parallel to

171
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,479
to to this activity these pedagogical

172
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,199
activities

173
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:19,120
media lab was also structured by the

174
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:21,120
practice of datascapes

175
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,400
which are research endeavors that

176
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,639
consists in

177
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,919
building at the same time data sets

178
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:28,240
research questions

179
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:29,758
and a web publication which combines

180
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:33,120
hypertextual navigation

181
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:35,600
and data visualization so these two

182
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:37,759
prior experiences gave practical

183
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:41,280
gave practical and intellectual basis to

184
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:43,199
another project in the lab called aim

185
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:45,599
aim stands for an inquiry into mods of

186
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,479
existence so it's a project grounded in

187
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,880
the in

188
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:50,318
30 years of field study by a single

189
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:53,440
researcher which is called

190
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:56,400
bruno latur and this project consisted

191
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:57,199
among other activities in creating a

192
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,120
platform

193
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:00,560
allowing to read both the text written

194
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,759
by bonne latur

195
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:07,039
but also to browse the documents

196
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:09,360
so videos images references he gathered

197
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:11,440
during his career

198
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,280
and used to produce his arguments the

199
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:15,680
platform also allowed

200
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,719
readers to participate by proposing

201
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,639
contributions

202
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,919
in the same document-based variety

203
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:22,240
mindsets

204
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:23,520
so on this project i was a phd student

205
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,880
at the time

206
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,639
in a situation of participant

207
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,880
observation and

208
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:30,160
with the designer of the project who is

209
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:33,199
called donatorichi

210
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:35,520
we quickly started to think about ways

211
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:36,319
to reuse and translate this platform the

212
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,960
structure

213
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:40,560
uh or to fork it uh to fork its way of

214
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:43,039
writing close to the materials

215
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,879
to other research projects for that we

216
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:46,878
run we wrote a grant request

217
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:48,560
that asked funding to build an open

218
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:52,639
source technology to do that

219
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:54,639
but it was rejected twice um

220
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:56,240
but it was not a big deal because at the

221
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:57,840
same time

222
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,080
i published the first results of my

223
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:03,198
inquiry on the m project

224
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:05,039
in a co-written paper with members of

225
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:08,000
the team so the nato richie but also

226
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:10,159
christophe luca and bruno and it was not

227
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,520
just an account of my results but also

228
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:15,840
an experimental format on itself

229
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,280
based on what some called the scroll

230
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,878
telling which means that

231
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,479
things appear while you are scrolling

232
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:23,680
and reading the article

233
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:26,240
and it was so to speak a way to test

234
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,440
some some ideas that we were before

235
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,639
asking money for

236
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:33,360
but didn't have

237
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:34,399
so this first experiment was also the

238
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,200
occasion of

239
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:38,880
first technical experiments a custom

240
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:42,320
document generation system

241
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:45,120
using maradon and bibtex languages

242
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,440
to allow us so as a team of co-writers

243
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,760
to

244
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,800
directly write the article but also its

245
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:52,160
visualizations

246
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:53,279
specification and to iterate and

247
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:57,120
collectively

248
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:59,120
interact in this kind of of writing

249
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,920
so in parallel in the lab at the same

250
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:04,640
time controversy mapping courses

251
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:06,479
were scaled up because of their success

252
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,680
and this asked to develop an open source

253
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,920
solution

254
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,040
to that would allow to build social

255
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:14,160
sciences websites

256
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:15,519
in an idio in an easier way while

257
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,439
not being captive of commercial

258
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:20,839
platforms and

259
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:22,080
also while mitigating technological

260
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:24,880
obsolescence

261
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:27,600
problems that we saw arising with the

262
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:30,720
students productions

263
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:32,480
so out of this the team made a

264
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,640
solution which is called driving and

265
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,720
which consists in allowing

266
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:39,360
to turn a google drive folder into a

267
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:42,320
static website

268
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:44,000
so on my side after having a left

269
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:47,279
medialab to continue my phd

270
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,920
i developed on my on my side and

271
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:51,200
some processes i developed some of the

272
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:54,399
processes i observed

273
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:57,360
and tested around the end project and

274
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:58,560
it came out as something called peritext

275
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,480
which is a series of

276
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,160
hypotheses about what document

277
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,000
structures and

278
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,279
modes of presentation would address a

279
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,399
better interweaving

280
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:11,519
uh between in empirical materials

281
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:13,600
uh writing and scholarly publication

282
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:15,279
and to make a meaningful use of

283
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:18,079
polymorphic poly formats

284
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:19,680
contemporary context of holy publishing

285
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:23,279
i mean by that

286
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:26,719
publishing on a on the web but also

287
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:27,920
in a various editorial contexts so to do

288
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:31,040
that

289
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,760
i wonder uh what would be a thinking of

290
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,599
writing

291
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:36,000
at the contextualization of some

292
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,839
resources

293
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,040
and i wondered what would happen if

294
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:41,680
researchers had

295
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:43,439
the opportunity to specify to specify

296
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:45,359
more finely

297
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,880
those contextualizations and how they

298
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,640
should look like depending on their

299
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,360
position in the text but also depending

300
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,399
on the output

301
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,959
formats a second hypothesis was to think

302
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:57,279
about these

303
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:59,680
resources as all possible points

304
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:00,720
of departure for writing activities

305
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,719
instead of just

306
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,000
considering texts so chapters and

307
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,920
sections as

308
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,680
the backbone of what scholarly

309
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:10,560
publishing could be

310
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:11,680
so this would allow to generate a

311
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:15,040
variety of

312
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:17,199
additions for a given prediction and to

313
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:19,120
very point of view

314
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,480
under roles for the documents being

315
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:24,880
produced depending on

316
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:28,000
the research stage or its aim

317
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,800
so once i formulated this hypothesis i

318
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,480
wanted to

319
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,640
to test them but that would have

320
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,880
required the inside project

321
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,760
of creating yet another ecosystem of

322
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:39,360
javascript

323
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:43,120
libraries so i did it

324
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:46,160
and started to experiment with this

325
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:48,240
at first but after my so yeah

326
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:50,800
these are an example of the modules that

327
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:53,920
are inside this ecosystem

328
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:55,760
so after my phd funding ended i came

329
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,880
back to media lab

330
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:59,200
to cope with the challenge of

331
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:01,519
controversy mapping scaling up

332
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,320
and this was eventually the occasion to

333
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:05,760
actually test

334
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:08,880
this hypothesis on a real use case

335
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:10,319
so out of this came phono which is this

336
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:12,240
time collective efforts

337
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,920
uh and which is a collaborative editor

338
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,399
so open source everything is open source

339
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,719
is in

340
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:18,560
what you see here um a collaborative

341
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,760
editor allowing to write digital

342
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:22,479
dissertations

343
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,880
and download them aesthetic websites so

344
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,200
it's

345
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:27,279
built for social sciences in the sense

346
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:29,839
that it allows to write footnotes

347
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:30,880
to use bibliographic references and the

348
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:33,399
diversity of

349
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,560
resources and it allows to write

350
00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:37,519
hypertextually

351
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:38,079
through interactive lexicon and internal

352
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:40,320
links

353
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:42,000
it also allows students to design their

354
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:45,040
websites

355
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,240
within the interface so while doing that

356
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:49,040
my phd continued

357
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:51,040
and at the same time i developed a new

358
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:53,519
editor called ovid

359
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:55,040
which is a single user more experimental

360
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:58,320
and advanced

361
00:12:55,040 --> 00:13:01,360
uh tests of the peritex hypothesis

362
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:03,120
so of it is a turn towards

363
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,480
practices which are not necessarily

364
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,800
relevant for students

365
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:08,560
for instance data visualization but also

366
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:11,599
advanced glossary production

367
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:15,599
like entity definitions so places

368
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:17,600
a person etc etc and it also allows them

369
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:20,079
to go further in the design of the

370
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:22,639
outputs and to create multiple editions

371
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:23,839
both both for screen for screens and

372
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:27,120
printers

373
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:29,600
so these two uh these two projects

374
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,959
of course were developed together and

375
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:34,320
have a lot of uh

376
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:36,800
have a lot in common but their code base

377
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:39,519
remains separated mostly because they

378
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:41,130
address different contexts and goals

379
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:42,639
so um

380
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:44,720
[Music]

381
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:45,920
phono has been used by students by more

382
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:49,120
than 2

383
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:51,519
000 students by so far

384
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,880
and now they they are uh conducting and

385
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:55,199
doing their own experiments

386
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:56,240
on top of that uh framework and

387
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:59,040
concerning ovid

388
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,600
a document which happens to be my testis

389
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:03,839
should

390
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,839
be out someday soon

391
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:08,160
yeah here's the production from the

392
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:11,519
students so

393
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:13,760
yeah so now i will zoom

394
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:15,680
at a closer level and rather than

395
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:17,439
talking about temporal dynamics

396
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:19,439
i will focus on relation between people

397
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:22,399
at sake in tools development

398
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:25,680
how does the decision uh about our tools

399
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:27,760
evolution is made and implemented

400
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:29,599
and for that i will take the example of

401
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:32,959
a software called a

402
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:34,160
hive brother but before um speaking

403
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:37,439
about it

404
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:37,839
i must speak about heist so for for

405
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,839
which

406
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:41,440
high browser is a kind of uh interface

407
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:44,480
if you want

408
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:46,560
so hype is a tool

409
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,680
made for a very specific research um

410
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:50,160
practice

411
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:51,040
which embeds in its working strong

412
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,360
methodological

413
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:54,719
assumptions it's a tool allowing

414
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:58,000
researchers

415
00:14:54,720 --> 00:15:00,800
um to build corpuses of web by

416
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,399
a web page of web pages sorry about a

417
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,959
specific topic so for instance i don't

418
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:06,079
know

419
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:09,279
coronavirus or palm oil

420
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:10,800
so the idea is that these web pages

421
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:13,279
are selected and regrouped by

422
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:15,760
researchers as web entities

423
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:16,480
which represents the different actors of

424
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:19,519
the issues

425
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:21,760
so organizations persons

426
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:22,959
and then analyze the relationship

427
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:26,000
between

428
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:28,638
actors through the relationships

429
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,399
between webpages corresponding to them

430
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:32,240
so it is quite quantitative

431
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:34,160
in the sense that it allows researchers

432
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:36,959
to manually

433
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:38,560
choose which websites they want to add

434
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:40,800
to their corpus

435
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:42,079
but also by analyzing the contents of

436
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,719
these web pages

437
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:45,599
to generate automatic processes to fetch

438
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,000
new website

439
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,040
suggestions and then work iteratively

440
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,839
between the machine

441
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:54,160
and the and the researcher so now have

442
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:55,920
brother

443
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:58,560
in this quality quantitative frame is

444
00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:00,560
the student oriented interface to hive

445
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:03,359
and it allows to browse the web while

446
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:06,079
constituting the website's corpus

447
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,800
and students have a way to both read

448
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:09,439
websites

449
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:11,120
and see how their corpus evolves through

450
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:14,000
visualization

451
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,000
sorry for my voice

452
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:18,240
so after two years thank you

453
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:26,959
thank you so after two years

454
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:29,600
of uh using we decided that we should

455
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:30,319
continue the development of the project

456
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,279
and uh

457
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:34,720
make it evolve um in harmony with what

458
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:37,600
it was used for

459
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:38,639
so to do that we started with a series

460
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,639
of conversations

461
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:42,399
with all the all the persons in contact

462
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:46,079
with the app

463
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:46,079
so students teachers

464
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:53,519
but also engineers researchers and so on

465
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:55,920
so we discussed with them in which

466
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:58,959
context they use hive brother

467
00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:00,079
but we also i also asked them to perform

468
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:02,638
some activities while

469
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:03,439
being interviewed and encouraged to

470
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:05,039
explain

471
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,880
what they were doing understanding and

472
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:12,480
feeling

473
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:17,039
so from that a series of remarks were

474
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:19,679
were defined then turn into cards

475
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:20,319
and collectively discussed with all of

476
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:24,079
the actors

477
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:24,079
participating to that redesign

478
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:31,360
out of this uh these discussions

479
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:34,480
uh some wireframes were made and from

480
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:36,799
this uh this warframe these

481
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:39,919
propositions came out new discussions

482
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:39,918
and new iterations

483
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,440
so these meetings were interesting

484
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:46,320
because

485
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:48,320
they revealed the diversity of interests

486
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:50,559
and priorities within the lab

487
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:52,000
they allowed to carry a peaceful

488
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:55,678
negotiation process

489
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:58,720
but also to reveal the diverging

490
00:17:55,679 --> 00:18:01,840
attachments and concerns at hand in

491
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,840
in this process

492
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:08,720
so who are on this battlefield

493
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:10,000
which is the redesign meeting we have

494
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:13,280
the original designers

495
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,120
or their spokesperson who

496
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,799
design a clear methodology and its

497
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:19,918
embodiment in the tool

498
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:22,720
and don't want the tool to risk to

499
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:23,919
to to evolve in order to to risk of

500
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,760
confusing the

501
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:28,320
initial methodological message so to

502
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:31,200
speak that the tool is supposed to carry

503
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:32,480
we have also the developers who are

504
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:35,520
worried about

505
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:36,400
refactoring avalanches that would uh be

506
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:39,520
triggered by

507
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:41,120
uh new propositions and evolutions of of

508
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:43,360
the tool

509
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:45,439
we have also of course the teachers who

510
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:48,320
are using this in the classroom

511
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:49,440
and i want to voice out non-conventional

512
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:51,918
uses of the tool

513
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,880
such as for hive brother teaching

514
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:55,679
through the tool

515
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:56,880
how search engines work or using it as a

516
00:18:55,679 --> 00:19:00,640
tool for building

517
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:03,919
scholarly cytographies formatted in the

518
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:05,520
complaining bibliographical norms

519
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:07,520
we have also researchers who use the

520
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,400
tool even if it's made for students

521
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,080
initially

522
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,919
and they want to be able to discuss and

523
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,879
twitch methodological embeddings in the

524
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:16,480
tool

525
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:18,480
we have specialists um who bring their

526
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:22,160
also their strong archive archiving

527
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,160
culture and background to the discussion

528
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:26,799
and last but not least we have what i

529
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:29,360
call mediators

530
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:29,918
so people aimed who whose role is to

531
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:33,039
promote

532
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:34,720
explain documents and who are actually

533
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:37,360
articulating the tool with different

534
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:39,200
practical contexts

535
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,399
the two remarks about this uh this

536
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:43,200
situation

537
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:44,960
first is that these mediating roles are

538
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:47,200
quite important to allow distributed

539
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:49,760
negotiation uh concerning the evolution

540
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:51,919
of the tool but second is also that

541
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:53,679
several persons that you see listed here

542
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:55,520
are in multiple positions and this is

543
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:58,559
the feature of an interdisciplinary

544
00:19:55,520 --> 00:20:01,120
laboratory and this is uh

545
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:02,000
very useful to mitigate misunderstanding

546
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:04,840
and also to

547
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,080
enhance dialogue between functions and

548
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:10,000
responsibilities

549
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:12,960
who are however not not shared

550
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,679
so as a conclusion developing from the

551
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,840
field

552
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:17,520
means being situated in a diversity of

553
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,879
negotiation processes

554
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:21,200
between experiment and query and

555
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:22,960
software stabilizations but also between

556
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:25,760
multiple interests

557
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:28,080
interests voices and responsibilities

558
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:31,360
that way of doing allows us to

559
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:33,678
improve this the relevance of the tool

560
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:34,719
we make but also to foster important

561
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:37,120
conversations

562
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:38,960
uh scientific conversations concerning

563
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:42,639
the methodological assumptions

564
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:44,720
uh that we embed in the tool we make

565
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:46,320
it also allows to create an environment

566
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:48,640
an open environment of tools

567
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:50,320
which correspond to each other and to

568
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:52,720
finish i will just add that to

569
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:53,439
one of uh so i present two of the parts

570
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,120
of the

571
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:57,200
uh of this environment and one other

572
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:58,000
which is called tessel will be presented

573
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:01,200
tomorrow by

574
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:17,840
an official at length uh and

575
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:17,840
i will end on that thank you

576
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:30,320
um this is available

577
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:33,440
outside of french language

578
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:35,760
yeah so uh both

579
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:37,200
oh yeah so is this available in other

580
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:39,840
languages than french

581
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:41,360
so both have brother fonu but also ovid

are bilingual in french and

583
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:45,840
