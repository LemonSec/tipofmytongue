1
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:17,910
so it's 1,500 it's time for the next

2
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:20,240
talk by Merlin and Bart and I'm really

3
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:24,120
looking forward to this talk because

4
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:26,459
it's not as I perceive the project not

5
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:28,500
only about regaining control over your

6
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:31,410
smartphones which is of course very good

7
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:33,930
but it's also to be able to keep your

8
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:35,820
phones longer even if there's no further

9
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:38,820
support from vendors anymore that's what

10
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:41,600
else I also like but let's get more

11
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:53,640
first-hand facts from Marilyn and Bart

12
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:57,329
enjoy thank you does it work yeah works

13
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:58,979
good okay so I'm relying this is Bart

14
00:00:57,329 --> 00:01:00,210
I'm gonna briefly tell you what we're

15
00:00:58,979 --> 00:01:01,979
gonna be talking about that will

16
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:10,110
introduce ourselves and we'll roll right

17
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:11,759
into the contents so this is better so

18
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:13,890
our talk is titled say there's a few

19
00:01:11,759 --> 00:01:16,009
looks on the smartphone how to liberate

20
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:18,719
your device by running actual Linux and

21
00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:20,969
software you control so we're going to

22
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:23,880
briefly introduce ourselves first then I

23
00:01:20,969 --> 00:01:25,798
will talk about why why we need the

24
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:27,630
Linux in the smartphone like why do we

25
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:28,950
need it I think the answer is obvious

26
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:31,530
but maybe this isn't so we're gonna

27
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:33,270
discuss that for a while then I'll talk

28
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:35,579
about some hard and hardware problems

29
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:37,020
and potential solutions to that then

30
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:39,029
Bart will give you an overview of all

31
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:40,649
the existing software out there like all

32
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:43,259
the different efforts that people are

33
00:01:40,649 --> 00:01:45,329
undertaking he'll talk about post-market

34
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:48,270
less and I'll say I'll talk about my mom

35
00:01:45,329 --> 00:01:52,258
and by that time we should get to

36
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:54,359
questions so my name is Merlin or

37
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:55,740
merlion in Dutch I studied at the

38
00:01:54,359 --> 00:01:58,350
University of Amsterdam I did computer

39
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:59,820
science I do work for the into the

40
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:01,469
archive park I've worked it at the

41
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:03,990
wayback machine the archived webpages

42
00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:07,259
and books and CDs and all the cool stuff

43
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:09,660
and in my spare time at night I work on

44
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:11,400
my Melissa I am also a board member of

45
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:15,209
the MCM hacker space have been for a

46
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:16,910
while and I run tor exits and and work

47
00:02:15,209 --> 00:02:49,920
on other free software projects

48
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:54,420
so my name is okay so why should you run

49
00:02:49,920 --> 00:03:05,489
Linux on your smartphone there's a

50
00:02:54,420 --> 00:03:07,170
couple of reasons first of all so how

51
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:08,090
many of you are running iOS or Android

52
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:10,589
just raise your hands

53
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:13,140
iOS or Android how many of you are

54
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:15,870
running Android most of you are running

55
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:17,130
Android right so Android runs Linux of

56
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:19,110
some kind

57
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:20,100
but it's not really new Linux how much

58
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:24,900
of you how many of you are running

59
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:26,549
glinted us it's like 5% of the people

60
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:28,350
that just raise their hands so most of

61
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:30,240
you use Android that was installed by

62
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:34,320
your vendor which could be Motorola or

63
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:36,930
Google or some other hardware vendor and

64
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:37,859
if you look at what we do on our laptops

65
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:41,400
like how many people if you were running

66
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:45,750
Linux in your laptop right did you

67
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:47,040
install it yourself yeah okay but we do

68
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:48,870
this on our servers we do this on our

69
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,780
desktops we do this on our laptops but

70
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:52,680
we don't do it on our phones and there

71
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:55,230
are many reasons for that

72
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:56,940
and we'll get to some of those reasons

73
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:58,470
but first why would you want that so

74
00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:00,780
obviously if you run your software on

75
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:01,320
your phone on your laptop you have full

76
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:03,750
control

77
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:05,250
you re already having you decide what

78
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:07,320
runs you dislike what this show you want

79
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:08,850
you decided you want no more KDE or

80
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:11,780
Wayland or xorg

81
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:14,880
or sway or whatever you want to run and

82
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:17,100
I think that's very important I think

83
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:18,719
that's what draws a lot of different

84
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:20,760
crowds and and you know binds us

85
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:24,980
together in the fact that we can work on

86
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:24,980
all these different things and

87
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:28,380
it gives you different and we have the

88
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,380
free to modify whatever we want so we

89
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:32,610
can change the software we can fix stuff

90
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:34,620
we can work with the community to make

91
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:36,000
all this better and with the smartphone

92
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:37,380
so you really can't with Apple

93
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,850
it's just they work on something and

94
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:40,520
that's it maybe you can report a bug and

95
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:42,960
you'll hear something in a couple months

96
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:45,570
Google does some some of the code is

97
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:47,310
open source but they work in a closed

98
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:50,010
way so every now and then they just drop

99
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:51,720
code and that's kind of it so there's no

100
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:54,150
way that we as a community here can can

101
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:56,070
work together currently there's some

102
00:04:54,150 --> 00:05:00,210
efforts to do that but they're not super

103
00:04:56,070 --> 00:05:01,469
well-known yeah and of course if you if

104
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:03,150
you have an Android phone right now

105
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:05,790
you're depending on your manufacturer if

106
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:07,799
Motorola supports Android until 6.0 then

107
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:09,540
if you Android 7.0 is released or their

108
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:11,880
security fixes you have to wait from the

109
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:15,360
fix it or flash lenders arrest if it

110
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:17,130
supports your device and there's no

111
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,510
support and they usually they make you

112
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:22,080
get a new device every couple years

113
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:24,630
which is not ideal because you know I'm

114
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:26,760
still using my Nokia and 100 and have

115
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:30,680
been for the last ten years and it still

116
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:33,390
works fine and very often Android has

117
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:35,430
basically iOS as well had they have

118
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:36,570
spyware built into some point at the

119
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:38,880
point of you know like if you have your

120
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:43,380
phone you know it's tracking you in some

121
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:44,640
way and you have to figure out all these

122
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:46,409
different ways of tracks you have to

123
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:47,669
deny permissions for everything it gets

124
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:49,050
very tricky and I think the right way to

125
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:50,640
do it is to start where the device it

126
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:53,310
doesn't track you at all in any way and

127
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:55,919
then start reasoning about how you can

128
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:57,450
make it not vacuum very often there's a

129
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:59,160
lot of bloatware super large apps and

130
00:05:57,450 --> 00:06:01,050
logins of different communication

131
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:06,720
platforms and I think that's not not a

132
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:09,780
good thing for the community as well ok

133
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:11,310
so what does it mean if we want to be in

134
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:14,820
control we don't want to be dependent on

135
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:16,830
five mind if I here what do we need so I

136
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:19,680
think you sense your pieces of a glint

137
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:22,560
like smartphone is that it has mainline

138
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:24,090
Linux support and for those of you who

139
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,160
don't know mainline Linux means that you

140
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:28,260
can go to kernel.org your website of

141
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,120
Linux you download the latest release

142
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:31,650
and you can build a free device and it

143
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:33,390
works more or less though there might be

144
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:35,700
some driver issues but it just works and

145
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:37,590
for most of your Android devices you

146
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:38,770
can't do that it won't be supported in

147
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:40,508
Linux because the vendors

148
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:42,250
made some changes and maybe if you're

149
00:06:40,509 --> 00:06:45,400
lucky you can get two changes as the

150
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:46,990
last talk covered and that's kind of it

151
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:52,299
so if you all want to work together on

152
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:54,520
Linux we need this to to be there and we

153
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:56,680
don't we want most of the drivers to be

154
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:59,859
open source so that we can improve the

155
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:02,889
drivers make them better and we need a

156
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:05,350
boot loader without restrictions so if

157
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:06,610
you run a various Android boot loaders

158
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:10,000
or something else as long as they allow

159
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:11,530
you to boot Linux your own version of

160
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,389
Linux so it doesn't have it's not signed

161
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:14,888
by some cryptographic key and you can

162
00:07:13,389 --> 00:07:17,199
just do it yourself that's probably good

163
00:07:14,889 --> 00:07:18,960
enough will be ID you if the boot loader

164
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:21,280
is completely open-source from the start

165
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:24,190
but that might not be completely

166
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:25,179
realistic and of course if you have

167
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:26,380
Linux in the boot loader you need

168
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:28,389
something other than the kernel to

169
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:30,789
actually do stuff with your phone so we

170
00:07:28,389 --> 00:07:34,180
need usable user space that's free and

171
00:07:30,789 --> 00:07:36,039
open source and ideally there will be

172
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:41,110
many distros and many new eyes like we

173
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:44,710
have right now in our laptops but

174
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:46,810
there's quite some problems so if you

175
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:49,150
put your laptop with Intel you just kind

176
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:52,030
of insert the whatever your distro is

177
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:53,650
maybe you want to CD or USB stick and it

178
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:55,750
boots to a bootloader and it's just

179
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:57,520
boost to a desktop or you want and you

180
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:58,979
can do things on the phone this doesn't

181
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:01,570
work that way

182
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:03,490
however support an arm is different

183
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:04,810
there's no bios that sets everything up

184
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:06,310
and downloads a bootloader and then the

185
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:08,050
boot will go to the next and Linux tooth

186
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:10,300
looks like whatever the BIOS provides

187
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:12,400
provides it on on whatever whatever's on

188
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:14,560
the PCI bus still local drivers this is

189
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:16,570
not their own arm there's no currently

190
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,130
very good infrastructure to do that

191
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:19,659
there's some there's some progress has

192
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:22,840
been made but for a lot of the devices

193
00:08:19,659 --> 00:08:24,940
that doesn't work so that's harder you

194
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:27,880
have to often compile your own kernel

195
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:31,120
with the right options so you can't just

196
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:32,620
plug in something and hope it works and

197
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,089
of course most of devices that I said

198
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:35,709
have been there only only kernels say

199
00:08:34,089 --> 00:08:37,329
they take take Linux in a certain point

200
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:38,649
they add some things and that's that's

201
00:08:37,328 --> 00:08:41,500
kind of eight they never contributed

202
00:08:38,649 --> 00:08:43,360
back the bootloader sometimes even

203
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:44,860
lockdown and specifically boot loaders

204
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,120
here you have to configure the manual

205
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:47,110
they often compile them as well because

206
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,790
they have the same problem they don't

207
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:49,350
know what hardware is in your device and

208
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:51,750
they

209
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:53,370
and detects what what they should

210
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:57,120
support so you can render something on

211
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:59,880
your screen and there are so many

212
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,230
devices there's so many different

213
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:02,820
Android phones and there's so many

214
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:05,220
different Chinese ones and different

215
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:06,810
large United States manufacturers and

216
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:08,640
let our problem this power management

217
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:11,790
power management the desktop and laptop

218
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,990
is pretty good with Linux nowadays like

219
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:15,000
some if you're lucky you can get eight

220
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:16,620
or nine hours in your laptop if your

221
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,870
phone lasts only eight or nine hours in

222
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:20,550
your pocket and gets warm it's not a

223
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:24,600
very good like you need we need

224
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:26,219
something better and with a 64-bit Aram

225
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:28,520
some of what I said before got a little

226
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:31,530
better so there's some way to detect

227
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:33,780
what drivers you have if you have a if I

228
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:39,060
boot loader then you can kind of do it

229
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:40,110
but it's still some problematic so these

230
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:42,300
are a lot of problems there's some

231
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:43,590
solutions that we as a community can or

232
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:45,240
some things we can do as a community to

233
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:47,280
hopefully make this a little less

234
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:49,980
painful we can focus only only a couple

235
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:51,990
devices so take a couple of Android

236
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:54,000
phones or whatever phones people might

237
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:56,910
that are not that hard to support or are

238
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,320
GPL friendly I mean I have GPL fan

239
00:09:56,910 --> 00:10:01,380
friendly manufacturers that kind of

240
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,790
stuff will be good or if many people are

241
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:05,730
manufacturing new devices they should

242
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:07,110
pick a system on ship that is well

243
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:09,480
supported by Linux already so

244
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:11,400
system-on-chip is basically the computer

245
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:13,200
and graphics card most of the things

246
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:18,030
integrated in a simple small thing that

247
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:19,980
is on your phone and there's actually a

248
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:21,810
company doing that or several companies

249
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:25,170
doing that will cover them in a bit and

250
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:27,359
I think the way to actually get linux

251
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:29,579
support proper is not to rely on Android

252
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,020
and on Android kernel via vendor to

253
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:33,230
provide some drivers and then rely on it

254
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:35,430
so there's there's some good projects

255
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:37,140
abstraction layers around Android and

256
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:39,660
Android drivers so you can run your own

257
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:40,949
Linux stuff on there but it doesn't get

258
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:45,569
us any closer to actual

259
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:46,890
mainline Linux on our phones so there

260
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:51,330
are two companies working on new devices

261
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:54,330
right now the first one is pint 64 they

262
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:56,460
have a stand in the aw building today I

263
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:57,900
think they might have a stand on till 5

264
00:10:56,460 --> 00:11:00,100
so after it's all finishes you can still

265
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:02,920
go there

266
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:05,920
and they are showing off their phone and

267
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:08,229
tablet with various OSS that currently

268
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:09,880
are in alpha state are kind of working

269
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:12,610
right now so if you're excited you go

270
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:14,980
there and specifically they are working

271
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:16,660
on something called the pine phone maybe

272
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:20,079
not surprising

273
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:21,880
it features an all winner a 64 SOC

274
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:23,680
system-on-chip and it has very good main

275
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:25,720
line support and this is not necessarily

276
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:28,180
because of the company owner but because

277
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:29,470
for the last couple years people who

278
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:31,269
visit Boston have been working very

279
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:32,800
actively to support the devices because

280
00:11:31,269 --> 00:11:35,410
you can find a lot of single board

281
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,790
computers so if you know Raspberry Pi

282
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:38,439
ders thought about our boards like that

283
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:40,810
like there's only max boards and Pi in

284
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:42,459
64 they make boards with ownerships in

285
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:46,149
there and you can use them as a small

286
00:11:42,459 --> 00:11:48,489
server at home or as a media box so

287
00:11:46,149 --> 00:11:50,589
mainline support in Linux is really good

288
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:52,300
the driver supports is getting a pretty

289
00:11:50,589 --> 00:11:55,149
decent there's two gig two gigabyte of

290
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:58,740
RAM MMC and a quad core CPU and there's

291
00:11:55,149 --> 00:12:01,839
an open source PD driver for many years

292
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:06,100
specifically 3d in the whole am space

293
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:07,899
has been a big problem and I don't I

294
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:11,529
think four or five years ago someone

295
00:12:07,899 --> 00:12:13,870
here livvie started working on the Lima

296
00:12:11,529 --> 00:12:15,730
driver for the mali-400 GPU he did a lot

297
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:17,769
of work he did a big talk here on the K

298
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:18,819
building a couple years ago and then

299
00:12:17,769 --> 00:12:20,709
stopped working on it and then always

300
00:12:18,819 --> 00:12:22,120
picked it up and now today we actually

301
00:12:20,709 --> 00:12:25,839
have a driver that works on way on the

302
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:27,040
next org so that's awesome and another

303
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:29,889
cool thing that the platform features

304
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:33,279
are kill switches so if you want to only

305
00:12:29,889 --> 00:12:34,750
turn off your microphone you just flip a

306
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:35,949
physical switch and then the line of

307
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:37,300
your microphone no longer runs your

308
00:12:35,949 --> 00:12:41,469
phone's there's no way that whatever you

309
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:42,969
say will be recorded by the moment you

310
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:44,410
can do the same for Wi-Fi you can turn

311
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:46,269
up your cameras you can do the same for

312
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:48,300
Bluetooth so that's that's kind of neat

313
00:12:46,269 --> 00:12:51,430
if you want some extra privacy features

314
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:55,719
it features the worldwide 4G LTE modem

315
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:57,880
so wherever you go just work and they

316
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:59,529
will likely when the phone is finished

317
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:01,240
allow you to pick a distribution that

318
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:03,009
kind of works on the phone and then

319
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:07,319
they'll pre install it for you so it's

320
00:13:03,009 --> 00:13:07,319
kind of cool how that work continued

321
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:17,360
and it costs 150 years approximately the

322
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:19,850
the other company is purism is making

323
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:23,930
the leap in five this might be more

324
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:26,060
known to the community the device is

325
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:29,000
actually based on the difference soft

326
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:31,939
and the pinecone is it's a bit more

327
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,440
powerful as well kill switches are

328
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:35,390
actually on the outside called a pine

329
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:37,520
phone they're on the inside of the phone

330
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:42,500
so it's a bit hard but easier actually

331
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:45,319
to flick the switch the mainline sport

332
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:46,940
is also pretty good the still transforms

333
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:49,040
from out of three patches but they're

334
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:53,570
actively being worked on and being up

335
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:56,750
streams from purism they're working on

336
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:58,610
the distribution POS which is the main

337
00:13:56,750 --> 00:14:02,720
focus for the living five probably gonna

338
00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:05,060
run us out of the box and at the moment

339
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:07,100
they have to chestnut relationships that

340
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:10,099
just means it's one of the first batches

341
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:13,880
that a ship they work in several batches

342
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:16,070
meaning the first batch as is basically

343
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:17,900
an early version and there might be some

344
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:20,090
little issues with it and the next batch

345
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:22,010
has no issues fixed and then some issues

346
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:24,290
might occur there in the next issue next

347
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:27,080
batch has those issues fixed and just a

348
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:28,250
tradition is basically for the the

349
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:31,490
Braveheart that the people that don't

350
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:34,880
really mind having some issues and don't

351
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:38,510
mind working around them I think right

352
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:41,320
now the price is $800 but it's changing

353
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:44,300
a bit so it might not be accurate and

354
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:48,650
depending on the reach in your s it uses

355
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:53,209
a different modem I think especially USA

356
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:54,439
versus Europe and Indian but it's

357
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:56,720
basically just as promise can define

358
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:59,180
phone and hopefully we'll see a lot of

359
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:04,100
people next year using is instead of

360
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:06,739
their Android phones so to give an

361
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:08,870
overview of the currently various

362
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:11,450
efforts to put Linux on mobiles and

363
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:12,130
there are a lot of distros out there at

364
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:15,760
the moment

365
00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:17,920
just to start somewhere we fkd nail made

366
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:20,230
by the KDE projects it's already used on

367
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:23,410
desktop a lot and it's just basically

368
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:26,980
based on dome over sorry ubuntu with the

369
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:29,530
newest KDE stack on it a case of mobile

370
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:33,520
they put the newest versions of all the

371
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:35,620
mobile components Kady on it to make it

372
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:38,410
work on current phones just not the

373
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:40,150
point phone in the liberal 5 but on the

374
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:43,060
regular Android phones they use live

375
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:45,189
Hybris which is a technique to make

376
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:49,209
androids drivers and stuff work on

377
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:51,430
regular Linux systems and it's basically

378
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:56,740
the main the main developments

379
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:58,510
distribution for Kady or mobile the next

380
00:15:56,740 --> 00:16:01,120
one will be a bun to touch this is

381
00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:03,970
probably the most completed distribution

382
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:06,010
at the moment out there it works a bit

383
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:09,940
differently than most distributions the

384
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:12,160
base system is read-only and they

385
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:15,160
install packages with they call to click

386
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:17,500
system and if they update the system

387
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:19,480
it's just reboots into the coffee motors

388
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:22,630
installs the new version then reboots

389
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:26,740
into it instead of running say apt-get

390
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:29,290
update it counts with unity 8th on most

391
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:31,740
devices at the moment it uses again live

392
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:34,030
hybrids to work to make the drives work

393
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:36,280
but they're quite far advanced as well

394
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:38,290
with 0.1 and leaving 5 to make it work

395
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:43,510
with mainline drivers and without sleep

396
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:45,310
Ivers and if you want to run Linux on

397
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:47,260
mobile system like this year and you

398
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:52,209
want some apps to run a bunch of Tosh is

399
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:55,120
probably your best bet then we have Nemo

400
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:58,080
mobile based on the originally on mer

401
00:16:55,120 --> 00:17:00,520
nowadays that's basically sailfish OS

402
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:02,170
basically takes sailfish OS but replace

403
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:04,750
the proprietary components of it with

404
00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:07,300
free and open source software that makes

405
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:10,780
me come down to the user interface and

406
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:12,339
applications that come with it it

407
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:14,670
basically runs on every device that

408
00:17:12,339 --> 00:17:17,260
sailfish OS Ronson let's just replace we

409
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:18,699
put a repository of them on top of it

410
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:21,000
install the different packages and it

411
00:17:18,699 --> 00:17:21,000
will run

412
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:27,779
now we have loon OS it's based on the

413
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:29,820
older webOS which was made by LG they

414
00:17:27,779 --> 00:17:31,409
originally discontinued the efforts to

415
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:33,928
make repairs and then the community

416
00:17:31,409 --> 00:17:37,440
decided to fork it magnanimous nowadays

417
00:17:33,929 --> 00:17:39,779
LG has picked of WebQuest again so lunar

418
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:41,779
s is nowadays working with LG to bring

419
00:17:39,779 --> 00:17:44,249
the all the components back together

420
00:17:41,779 --> 00:17:46,409
make sure that stays open source and

421
00:17:44,249 --> 00:17:49,139
it's based on modern techniques and

422
00:17:46,409 --> 00:17:51,869
hardware again it uses lip Hybris to

423
00:17:49,139 --> 00:17:53,369
work instead of mainline drivers but

424
00:17:51,869 --> 00:17:55,619
they're working on the pine phone as

425
00:17:53,369 --> 00:17:59,428
well in which case again to use the

426
00:17:55,619 --> 00:18:01,590
mainline drivers properly then we've

427
00:17:59,429 --> 00:18:02,820
asteroid to West it's big difference

428
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:06,209
it's not pretty smartphone the West

429
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:08,330
memorial SmartWatch cos it again you

430
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:10,109
slip Hybris it's made for the

431
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:12,720
smartwatches which basically at the

432
00:18:10,109 --> 00:18:14,340
moment or an Android watch it's a

433
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:16,739
regular Linux system I think it's based

434
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:21,299
on yoke so or openembedded I'm not

435
00:18:16,739 --> 00:18:24,090
entirely sure the UI and stuff is again

436
00:18:21,299 --> 00:18:28,950
based on mer which is updated in a

437
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:31,709
different direction then a OSC it's made

438
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:34,919
for more of the Eastern Asian markets

439
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:37,109
its main focuses on plasma mobile runs

440
00:18:34,919 --> 00:18:37,950
on mainline only it doesn't run on any

441
00:18:37,109 --> 00:18:39,899
other devices

442
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:41,309
that's do not have main lines first

443
00:18:39,899 --> 00:18:46,559
message at the moment mainly the pine

444
00:18:41,309 --> 00:18:49,379
phone and liberal 5 and then with pure

445
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:50,940
OS this is made by purism the company

446
00:18:49,379 --> 00:18:52,918
that makes the libram 5 it's mainly

447
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:54,960
focused on running on the Libyan 5

448
00:18:52,919 --> 00:18:59,220
although also on the other leave

449
00:18:54,960 --> 00:19:01,679
products over the laptops this is your

450
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:03,419
West well ship with Porsche I'm not sure

451
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:05,730
how to pronounce properly but it's based

452
00:19:03,419 --> 00:19:07,679
on the chrome stack they used known

453
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:10,980
technologies and they run gnome

454
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:13,049
applications but adapter so they are

455
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:13,799
made responsive and will resize them to

456
00:19:13,049 --> 00:19:17,369
various

457
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:20,399
phone sizes this pure RS is made to only

458
00:19:17,369 --> 00:19:22,590
run a mainline kernel scuzz only made to

459
00:19:20,399 --> 00:19:24,570
run on leave in 5 really but if here you

460
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:30,869
can run on any phone that has mainline

461
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:33,800
and it's a fork of DAB unit then we've

462
00:19:30,869 --> 00:19:35,449
mint Jarrow they pops up recently

463
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:37,220
showing they have interest in making a

464
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:40,220
mobile version as well it's meant to our

465
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:42,020
arm project they focus at the moment on

466
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:44,270
plasma mobile but - based on art so

467
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:48,260
inferior become anything that ours can

468
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:49,879
run and also it's made to run only on

469
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:54,650
mainline kernels and at the moment are

470
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:56,870
working on magnet pinecone and then we

471
00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:58,940
have next to s lost year they cut

472
00:19:56,870 --> 00:20:00,889
funding by an L net to work on it so

473
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:03,740
they now have a full-time developer it's

474
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:06,410
a standalone OS works a bit differently

475
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:09,530
the peck dementia is quite interesting I

476
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:11,960
can recommend you look into it it runs

477
00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:13,370
on the point phone as well but you're

478
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:15,620
also trying to get its own run on

479
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:18,949
existing Android devices in which case

480
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:20,780
again you sleep ibis the test of the

481
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:22,550
interfaces will come with it's not set

482
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:24,379
in stone yet so working on multiple

483
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:26,178
interfaces so you can probably

484
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:28,880
eventually run plus mobile and it's a

485
00:20:26,179 --> 00:20:34,220
forge and unity and hopefully lots of

486
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:36,800
others so postmarked OS that's what I

487
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:41,030
work on in my opinion the best one but

488
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:43,580
probably what others disagree this was

489
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:46,190
announced on the 26th of May 2017 by

490
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:48,169
Oliver Smith he had worked on it in

491
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:50,240
private for a year by then he made some

492
00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:51,980
basic toolings working it and at that

493
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:55,130
point he thought was ready to show it to

494
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:56,809
the world when he made the original blog

495
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:58,790
post that announced the project's it's

496
00:20:56,809 --> 00:21:02,750
only supported two devices or at least

497
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:05,690
Buddhist on two devices but basically

498
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:07,940
now we boot up to hung one on the Ceph

499
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:09,500
three three devices it sounds like a lot

500
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:11,900
but it's probably not even half of all

501
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:13,160
the Android phones out there it's quite

502
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:16,040
a lot

503
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:17,540
do note we say supports but doesn't mean

504
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:19,250
you can pick up the phone install

505
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:21,770
postmark device on it and expect to make

506
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:23,690
a call and have fun with it it's more

507
00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:25,370
most advice or more in like a best way

508
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:26,660
by state if working Wi-Fi if we're

509
00:21:25,370 --> 00:21:29,178
working screen and you can run some

510
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:30,679
interesting application it but don't

511
00:21:29,179 --> 00:21:32,809
expect that you can make calls or

512
00:21:30,679 --> 00:21:35,270
centers mess with it we do have a few

513
00:21:32,809 --> 00:21:37,160
devices that's what you can make all

514
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:39,170
square for at least close to make all

515
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:44,000
space but most of them will not be the

516
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:45,610
case well boys market is based on Alpine

517
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,200
Linux it's

518
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:50,809
brought me mostly popular distro for

519
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:53,299
docker containers and on server

520
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:55,490
installations but will also work fine on

521
00:21:53,299 --> 00:21:59,210
the laptops desktops and in our house

522
00:21:55,490 --> 00:22:01,580
phones we chose alpine linux mainly

523
00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:03,289
because it's really tiny the basis

524
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:05,059
Latian without the kernel that is it's

525
00:22:03,289 --> 00:22:07,129
only six megabytes big so that's

526
00:22:05,059 --> 00:22:11,539
basically a booting system once you add

527
00:22:07,129 --> 00:22:13,158
the kernel and because we work we chose

528
00:22:11,539 --> 00:22:15,200
this because of size because we work

529
00:22:13,159 --> 00:22:17,389
with a lot to change truth we every time

530
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,860
we do something we make a change to do

531
00:22:17,389 --> 00:22:21,918
some stuff in it we remove the chain

532
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:23,750
truth and that happens a lot and if you

533
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:25,610
do that like 6 times a day you don't

534
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:28,309
really want to wait every time the whole

535
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:30,258
in distribution is installed because our

536
00:22:28,309 --> 00:22:31,970
system is only only the basis anyway

537
00:22:30,259 --> 00:22:34,370
it's only 6 megabytes big this is an

538
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:37,039
issue the change routes are made and

539
00:22:34,370 --> 00:22:40,428
this inmates and remove the and inferior

540
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:44,029
within seconds and the development is

541
00:22:40,429 --> 00:22:46,700
quick because of it we are basically a

542
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:48,470
digital repository on top of LP Linux so

543
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:51,350
we use all the package from LP Linux and

544
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:53,629
although we have our own custom stuff

545
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:56,360
sometimes we do try to upstream as much

546
00:22:53,629 --> 00:22:58,459
as possible by Linux and where possible

547
00:22:56,360 --> 00:23:03,500
also custom patches to the various

548
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:06,049
projects that are out there we are

549
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:08,990
like next OS basically we are interface

550
00:23:06,049 --> 00:23:11,600
agnostic meaning we currently focusing

551
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:13,970
on plasma mobile but we also ship Foss

552
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:15,649
we had unity in the past unity ace and

553
00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:18,440
we'll ship hopefully ship with it again

554
00:23:15,649 --> 00:23:20,899
in the future but we also ship with

555
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:23,330
Hilden from a molester and hopefully in

556
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:26,418
the future also glacier UI and any other

557
00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:28,039
your ID of my pop-up so we try to give

558
00:23:26,419 --> 00:23:29,809
the choice to the user you can use our

559
00:23:28,039 --> 00:23:32,450
system and it doesn't mean you have you

560
00:23:29,809 --> 00:23:36,559
have to be forced to one interface or

561
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:38,809
another like I said before don't expect

562
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:40,639
most of Isis to install it on the system

563
00:23:38,809 --> 00:23:43,340
on and then expect it to call we are

564
00:23:40,639 --> 00:23:45,949
basically in alpha state you can boot

565
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:48,559
the system you can mess around with it

566
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:51,259
have fun and except for a few devices

567
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:54,020
you probably won't use this phone in our

568
00:23:51,259 --> 00:23:59,390
case but the rest berry pie is also cool

569
00:23:54,020 --> 00:24:01,129
so you can use it like this we are we

570
00:23:59,390 --> 00:24:04,940
have four channels on matrix and I see

571
00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:06,980
please join when you feel free we need

572
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:11,110
both end users and developers we can use

573
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:17,000
all the help and hope to see you there

574
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:27,709
back to Moline thank you yeah I think so

575
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:28,790
okay definitely words right okay so I'm

576
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:31,340
gonna tell you a bit about what I've

577
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:32,659
been working on which is may Melissa I

578
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:34,040
hope I pronounce it correctly I'm not

579
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:35,990
from Finland and I've heard people

580
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:38,480
pronounce it differently me mo mo

581
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:41,300
I say me mo hope it doesn't offend

582
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:43,700
anyone it was developing Nokia a long

583
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:46,399
time ago Nokia was in the smartphone

584
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:48,470
business an internet about business

585
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:50,450
maybe even before Apple made their first

586
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:52,490
iPhone maybe it was around the same time

587
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:54,080
and they have been working on name off

588
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:57,610
for a while that they had various

589
00:24:54,080 --> 00:25:00,830
internet tablets they had the N 770 n800

590
00:24:57,610 --> 00:25:02,300
n810 those ro internet tablets you can

591
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:04,790
use them for navigation but they had no

592
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:09,428
cellular modem in there and then they

593
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:11,420
made the 100 that I still use today and

594
00:25:09,429 --> 00:25:14,870
they had a lot of people working on that

595
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:16,460
OS and it was based on Debian and but I

596
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:19,159
don't mean that they literally use of

597
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:22,490
Debian repository but they used apt the

598
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:23,900
package manager to the package format

599
00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:28,370
and a lot of the base system was the

600
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:31,700
same they actually sold a lot of devices

601
00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:33,169
they sold I think a lot at least I think

602
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:36,820
it's a lot they saw a couple hundred

603
00:25:33,170 --> 00:25:39,050
thousand Nokia n900 at least so a lot of

604
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:40,428
people who don't typically visit first

605
00:25:39,050 --> 00:25:46,340
time actually use that device probably

606
00:25:40,429 --> 00:25:47,960
for a couple years and it's still being

607
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:49,220
maintained by the community there were

608
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:51,080
actually a lot of people using it was

609
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:53,390
kind of dubbed the hacker phone because

610
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:54,500
Nokia 900 had a radio transmitter and

611
00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:56,000
receiver in there so you could put it in

612
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:57,170
your car and it will transmit radio on

613
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,170
your car radio and you can just listen

614
00:25:57,170 --> 00:26:01,760
to that and a lot a lot of cool features

615
00:25:59,170 --> 00:26:02,960
and then community maintain it for a

616
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,269
long time but now there's not a level

617
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,679
not another a lot of me

618
00:26:04,269 --> 00:26:07,419
anymore but the cool thing is that they

619
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:10,749
still have a lot of packages on memo

620
00:26:07,419 --> 00:26:15,609
that work with maps calculators useful

621
00:26:10,749 --> 00:26:17,409
stuff okay and I'd be using it ever

622
00:26:15,609 --> 00:26:19,119
since as I said and the big problem is

623
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:20,589
that not everything in Maemo 5 which is

624
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:23,109
the main what they made for the no kami

625
00:26:20,589 --> 00:26:26,428
100 is open source

626
00:26:23,109 --> 00:26:30,218
if it was a ship I think it would have

627
00:26:26,429 --> 00:26:31,389
kept on living for a long time ever

628
00:26:30,219 --> 00:26:34,299
since they made it and not you know be

629
00:26:31,389 --> 00:26:35,559
in a hiatus data for a while and big

630
00:26:34,299 --> 00:26:41,589
parts are not open source that's a

631
00:26:35,559 --> 00:26:45,369
problem so I've covered some of it like

632
00:26:41,589 --> 00:26:46,539
why are we doing is I I love the OS and

633
00:26:45,369 --> 00:26:49,418
I still want to be able to use it that's

634
00:26:46,539 --> 00:26:51,908
a personal reason for me and this phone

635
00:26:49,419 --> 00:26:54,129
100 is becoming very old so I need a new

636
00:26:51,909 --> 00:26:55,509
device on which I can run the same or

637
00:26:54,129 --> 00:26:56,678
similar software which actually gives me

638
00:26:55,509 --> 00:26:59,409
the newest class the next on my phone

639
00:26:56,679 --> 00:27:02,829
and I just wanted to be fully open

640
00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:04,299
source because this one is not so and

641
00:27:02,829 --> 00:27:06,489
it's been used by a lot of ordinary

642
00:27:04,299 --> 00:27:08,379
users the UI might look a little arcane

643
00:27:06,489 --> 00:27:10,149
at this point I also use screenshot

644
00:27:08,379 --> 00:27:12,428
later I think it's actually very usable

645
00:27:10,149 --> 00:27:17,139
still but it doesn't look anything like

646
00:27:12,429 --> 00:27:18,940
iOS and Android now look look like and

647
00:27:17,139 --> 00:27:20,228
memo last is entirely community

648
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:22,089
community develop so over the years

649
00:27:20,229 --> 00:27:24,099
while the community members have worked

650
00:27:22,089 --> 00:27:26,168
and they've come and gone and there's

651
00:27:24,099 --> 00:27:27,999
currently three or four people actively

652
00:27:26,169 --> 00:27:30,369
working on maimie lefse and we started

653
00:27:27,999 --> 00:27:32,529
about two years ago and there's a lot

654
00:27:30,369 --> 00:27:34,119
more people joining and testing and and

655
00:27:32,529 --> 00:27:36,909
fixing minor things but there's like

656
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:40,238
three or four core developers so it's

657
00:27:36,909 --> 00:27:41,200
not that many and I really like the fact

658
00:27:40,239 --> 00:27:42,879
that we're coming to develop because

659
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:44,649
there's no corporate backing and there's

660
00:27:42,879 --> 00:27:46,570
no special interest nobody wants to run

661
00:27:44,649 --> 00:27:48,189
their specific cloud in our device and

662
00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:50,379
we're not pre installing any specific

663
00:27:48,190 --> 00:27:51,820
cloud software or whatever and there's

664
00:27:50,379 --> 00:27:53,049
no specific direction that will take it

665
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:57,489
just because the company wants it or

666
00:27:53,049 --> 00:27:59,049
things that makes sense financially and

667
00:27:57,489 --> 00:28:00,519
it's compatible with this existing

668
00:27:59,049 --> 00:28:03,149
software so it's supposed to I think

669
00:28:00,519 --> 00:28:07,209
every single mobile this for you names

670
00:28:03,149 --> 00:28:09,008
their own way line right and we are

671
00:28:07,209 --> 00:28:13,029
doing one that still uses x11 you can

672
00:28:09,009 --> 00:28:14,499
hate it or like it the code works in x11

673
00:28:13,029 --> 00:28:15,669
it was open-source there was no reason

674
00:28:14,499 --> 00:28:16,220
for us to make that work on we lent

675
00:28:15,669 --> 00:28:21,379
right now

676
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:22,909
and it uses a GT k23 + QD and there are

677
00:28:21,379 --> 00:28:24,740
some parts of the GDK but it's mostly

678
00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:27,259
theming and some and some widgets but it

679
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:29,360
also means that if you want to run let's

680
00:28:27,259 --> 00:28:30,860
say something crazy libre office you can

681
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:32,360
just install it and it will actually

682
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:33,350
just start in device it probably won't

683
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:35,750
be very usable because there's all these

684
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:37,789
buttons and menus but it will look

685
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:39,169
stylish Li the dialogues will be styled

686
00:28:37,789 --> 00:28:41,179
and they kind of integrate in the system

687
00:28:39,169 --> 00:28:44,269
if you take more simple occasions

688
00:28:41,179 --> 00:28:45,830
they'll probably just run and I think

689
00:28:44,269 --> 00:28:47,269
that's a big feat because if you were if

690
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:49,370
you base your work on top of Debian and

691
00:28:47,269 --> 00:28:53,000
and and and that one as I'll talk about

692
00:28:49,370 --> 00:28:54,320
in a bit then there's 20,000 faculties

693
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:57,139
in repository that you can all just

694
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:59,090
install on use and some of them might be

695
00:28:57,139 --> 00:29:05,049
a bit clunky but they might also be very

696
00:28:59,090 --> 00:29:08,350
good and everything we do is open-source

697
00:29:05,049 --> 00:29:10,730
everything that we right now is GPL and

698
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:12,769
if there's some open-source license that

699
00:29:10,730 --> 00:29:14,929
was not GPL before then we just run with

700
00:29:12,769 --> 00:29:18,139
it if they puppy wrote something that

701
00:29:14,929 --> 00:29:20,539
was not a GPL another thing that really

702
00:29:18,139 --> 00:29:24,830
like is that the API is for memo are

703
00:29:20,539 --> 00:29:26,480
developed with mobile in mind so they

704
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:28,309
thought about power management they

705
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:29,779
think about things like there's a

706
00:29:28,309 --> 00:29:31,639
participative sensors if you put

707
00:29:29,779 --> 00:29:32,840
something to your ear the screen needs

708
00:29:31,639 --> 00:29:33,678
to go off and the touch screen shouldn't

709
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:35,658
work anymore right because otherwise

710
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:37,039
you're pressing buttons or if you're in

711
00:29:35,659 --> 00:29:39,490
a darker room then the brightness should

712
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:42,320
adjust itself to the ambient level

713
00:29:39,490 --> 00:29:43,789
there's a compass in there if you flip

714
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:45,789
the phone it needs to go to portrait or

715
00:29:43,789 --> 00:29:48,379
landscape mode that kind of stuff and

716
00:29:45,789 --> 00:29:50,269
all the api's are there so if we're

717
00:29:48,379 --> 00:29:53,240
working on making all this work we have

718
00:29:50,269 --> 00:29:55,100
a fixed point we just followed what the

719
00:29:53,240 --> 00:30:00,440
API is that we re implement them and it

720
00:29:55,100 --> 00:30:02,600
all kinda just works it uses only like

721
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:07,009
80 megabytes hundred 50 megabytes is the

722
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:08,480
default I think on 64-bit devices and

723
00:30:07,009 --> 00:30:09,799
there's a lot of applications out there

724
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:12,049
that were community developed and if we

725
00:30:09,799 --> 00:30:13,370
keep the same API it's mostly then it's

726
00:30:12,049 --> 00:30:14,539
just a matter of it compiling them and

727
00:30:13,370 --> 00:30:16,489
they work so that's I think that's

728
00:30:14,539 --> 00:30:20,990
really cool and it allows us to keep

729
00:30:16,490 --> 00:30:23,240
focus so what do we do we ported code

730
00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:26,240
and we updated api's we looked at some

731
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:28,050
code programs that we're not open source

732
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:29,820
and we tried to figure out how they work

733
00:30:28,050 --> 00:30:31,350
mad at them if they were then we looked

734
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:35,730
at the interfaces and we try to just

735
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:37,169
make that work and we build everything

736
00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:39,950
in Jenkins so we have we have get

737
00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:42,120
repositories currently on github and

738
00:30:39,950 --> 00:30:43,470
Jenkins just builds whatever we commit

739
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:47,100
it built it for us and adds it back to

740
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:49,080
the Debian repository an installing memo

741
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:51,030
is as simple if you if you want to do it

742
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:52,710
you can just install Debian for that one

743
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:54,120
because we don't use systemd but

744
00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:57,420
someone's working on system they support

745
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:59,159
if you really want it but you just add a

746
00:30:57,420 --> 00:31:00,480
single line and you install our meta

747
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:01,620
pockets and that's it it just works on

748
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:04,290
top of that way and I think that's I

749
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:06,179
think that's really cool and our aim is

750
00:31:04,290 --> 00:31:08,870
to make it work for people here at

751
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:10,680
fascism at for hackers for open-source

752
00:31:08,870 --> 00:31:12,479
enthusiasts and not necessarily for the

753
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:15,300
end user will maybe get there but we're

754
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:17,610
not there now and real cool thing is

755
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:19,050
that I think somewhere mid last year we

756
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:21,929
submitted for funding for a new net

757
00:31:19,050 --> 00:31:24,030
which is a nonprofit in the Netherlands

758
00:31:21,930 --> 00:31:27,510
and we actually got 40,000 euros and

759
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:30,750
funding so we get to get pay for some of

760
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:32,910
the work we do this is what it looks

761
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:34,560
like on the n900 you can see that I was

762
00:31:32,910 --> 00:31:37,200
testing some Python bindings so the the

763
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:38,820
binary clock shows up there the actual

764
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:41,340
clock is not a binary clock I was just

765
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:43,649
testing a replacement clock applet it's

766
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:45,449
connected to the KP and network provider

767
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:49,650
in Netherlands on 3G the battery's full

768
00:31:45,450 --> 00:31:50,820
it's on Wi-Fi before says the Wi-Fi

769
00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:53,010
signals pretty strong it's currently

770
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:54,360
muted for sounds and it tells me there's

771
00:31:53,010 --> 00:32:01,830
that the application manager thinks

772
00:31:54,360 --> 00:32:02,399
there's an update available ok so what

773
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:05,760
do we have now

774
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:08,670
it's that it's alpha quality at best if

775
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:09,990
you've got super excited I'm sorry once

776
00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:11,460
it works and I can make phone calls I'm

777
00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:13,260
gonna start using it as my main device

778
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:15,780
I'm gonna keep on dogfooding it and I

779
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:17,430
hope others who do the same right now it

780
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:18,930
runs on the Nokia and then hundreds the

781
00:32:17,430 --> 00:32:21,630
motor worlds wait for in the pine phone

782
00:32:18,930 --> 00:32:24,810
I haven't mentioned the Motorola Droid 4

783
00:32:21,630 --> 00:32:27,090
before it's made by Motorola and it's

784
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:28,679
one of the last physical keyboard phones

785
00:32:27,090 --> 00:32:31,110
they made so no Canon has a physical

786
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:32,790
keyboard and that one does too and it

787
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:35,850
has a pretty good chip power management

788
00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:37,560
wise and someone I think two people have

789
00:32:35,850 --> 00:32:39,600
been working super actively on mainland

790
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:40,520
support for years and now it actually

791
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:42,500
works really well

792
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:44,300
so the Wi-Fi works the modem or X power

793
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:46,550
management works you can get a couple

794
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:50,178
days of power on that thing so I think

795
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:51,530
that's really cool and we use virtual

796
00:32:50,179 --> 00:32:54,080
machines for development so you can run

797
00:32:51,530 --> 00:32:55,580
QM you VMware virtual box and you can

798
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:58,129
just have the desktop environment in

799
00:32:55,580 --> 00:33:02,480
your virtual machine login over

800
00:32:58,130 --> 00:33:03,740
Association and do your development we

801
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:05,480
still need to get some core components

802
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:08,720
in place the main thing lacking I think

803
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:09,830
right now is a phone UI because we are

804
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:11,480
actually able to make some phone calls

805
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:13,309
using the command line but that's not

806
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:16,940
how you want to answer your phone or or

807
00:33:13,309 --> 00:33:18,530
make a phone call right I think it will

808
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:21,080
probably be a couple months honestly

809
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:23,809
until we get to that point but I'm still

810
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:26,629
pretty excited and as I said before

811
00:33:23,809 --> 00:33:28,879
there are demo devices and at the point

812
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:34,880
64 7 aw I think they'll be there until 5

813
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:36,650
so maybe very seeing them and I'm really

814
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:38,420
hoping that the power minds were really

815
00:33:36,650 --> 00:33:40,160
good because you know k900 last for

816
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:42,890
maybe a week a week and a half if I

817
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:46,330
don't use it that much I don't I've

818
00:33:42,890 --> 00:33:46,330
never seen that on an Android phone

819
00:33:46,370 --> 00:33:49,669
so these are the devices we support and

820
00:33:48,410 --> 00:33:51,230
there's a link up there with more

821
00:33:49,670 --> 00:33:52,760
devices that are not that well supported

822
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:55,550
but they kind of work like I said we

823
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:57,140
reach out to folks in a couple and last

824
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:58,760
but not least if you're really

825
00:33:57,140 --> 00:34:00,770
interested in power of VR which is the

826
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:03,920
3d driver on the Nokia 900 and the

827
00:34:00,770 --> 00:34:05,210
worldwide for the state was terrible and

828
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:07,070
we've been working on it with other

829
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:09,440
people for a year and a half and now you

830
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:11,750
can patch mainline Linux a little bit

831
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:13,909
and it will start the users of space is

832
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:16,668
still closed source but text system is

833
00:34:13,909 --> 00:34:20,690
actually building new binaries for us so

834
00:34:16,668 --> 00:34:25,040
it's actually looking pretty good leave

835
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:27,109
it apart that's a good Lucien as we

836
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:29,149
showed there are various UI is various

837
00:34:27,109 --> 00:34:33,529
distributions available basically every

838
00:34:29,149 --> 00:34:35,960
first choice is available impossible but

839
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:39,440
all of them do need work we need a lot

840
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:41,090
of help we nowadays we do have the vices

841
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:44,030
to run them on so please get a device

842
00:34:41,090 --> 00:34:46,070
get into the first channels ask what you

843
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:47,629
can do we don't just need developers we

844
00:34:46,070 --> 00:34:49,879
also need end-users we need people to

845
00:34:47,629 --> 00:34:52,149
write documentation and wait somewhere

846
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:54,219
everybody can do that

847
00:34:52,149 --> 00:34:56,960
hopefully this year

848
00:34:54,219 --> 00:34:59,209
probably first half-year maybe second

849
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:01,040
healthier expect songs to actually show

850
00:34:59,210 --> 00:35:02,960
up the pine foam will work the libra

851
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:05,300
five will by then work and hopefully

852
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:06,920
next year most people here will be able

853
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:09,010
to run such device and be able to come

854
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:11,690
up with it have fun with it

855
00:35:09,010 --> 00:35:13,700
just make sure don't be don't be afraid

856
00:35:11,690 --> 00:35:16,340
to ask questions we're all great people

857
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:20,060
we always appreciate a few help we can

858
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:21,890
get all the help we can get and we hope

859

and if you're interested in more

873
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:11,300
technical details for me most

874
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:12,830
specifically I did a talk a couple of

875
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:16,340
months ago in Bulgaria and open fest

876
00:36:12,830 --> 00:36:18,470
which is another great open source event

877
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:20,150
like this and it's about an hour long

878
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:22,009
the link is here I'll make sure that the

879
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:25,160
slides are on the FOSDEM website somehow

880
00:36:22,010 --> 00:36:33,250
and it's more technical and in-depth and

881
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:33,250
in this talk it's up there any questions

882
00:36:35,730 --> 00:36:40,230
little my father this bro he lost

883
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:47,760
with so many distributions being

884
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:50,590
available is there some plan to have

885
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:52,930
something like and everyone please leave

886
00:36:50,590 --> 00:36:54,640
quietly or shuffle quietly it because I

887
00:36:52,930 --> 00:36:56,980
can't hear please repeat with so many

888
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:59,170
distributions available here is it

889
00:36:56,980 --> 00:37:00,580
possible that you can run say I don't

890
00:36:59,170 --> 00:37:02,740
know if that'd make a snap on it to

891
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:05,380
develop in the package for one of the

892
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:06,910
distributions of for all of them or do

893
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:10,390
you have to basically build an apk for

894
00:37:06,910 --> 00:37:12,879
alpine adept with Airbnb based ones yeah

895
00:37:10,390 --> 00:37:14,350
yeah so I guess the question is if with

896
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:16,240
so many distributions available do you

897
00:37:14,350 --> 00:37:18,250
want to package the app for all the

898
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:18,939
different distributions or can use snap

899
00:37:18,250 --> 00:37:22,030
or flat back

900
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:25,060
I guess yeah it depends a bit on the

901
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:26,980
distribution most issues of data

902
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:29,049
mentioned do support something like flat

903
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:30,940
pack a snap you can package them in flat

904
00:37:29,050 --> 00:37:33,970
half and both you can install and run

905
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:35,980
them on your device not all distribution

906
00:37:33,970 --> 00:37:38,169
might necessarily support outdoors but

907
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:41,520
often Ash's apt-get install flat pack

908
00:37:38,170 --> 00:37:41,520
and it all work yeah

909
00:37:50,390 --> 00:37:54,368
yet

910
00:37:51,759 --> 00:37:58,239
okay okay are you working some all

911
00:37:54,369 --> 00:38:01,029
together with the Hollywood guys did you

912
00:37:58,239 --> 00:38:03,759
know I could not hear what you were

913
00:38:01,029 --> 00:38:08,319
saying please repeat you didn't hurt

914
00:38:03,759 --> 00:38:10,089
anything okay and so yeah are you

915
00:38:08,319 --> 00:38:13,049
working together with the helium guys to

916
00:38:10,089 --> 00:38:16,259
get the stick or Android mobile phones

917
00:38:13,049 --> 00:38:16,259
there's no

918
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:29,220
our young guys okay so the questions are

919
00:38:27,210 --> 00:38:31,500
we working together with Allium I think

920
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:32,669
how them is using Android is a base and

921
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:34,590
it's like an abstraction around how a

922
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:37,170
Android to make things work better on

923
00:38:34,590 --> 00:38:39,120
Android devices I think a lot of

924
00:38:37,170 --> 00:38:40,680
districts are but my mo is not because

925
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:42,870
we really want to focus on the main line

926
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:44,310
only and I don't want Android modem

927
00:38:42,870 --> 00:38:45,859
abstractions or graphics driver

928
00:38:44,310 --> 00:38:48,270
obstructions or anything else like that

929
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:50,370
maybe people in the period you have done

930
00:38:48,270 --> 00:38:52,980
it they've used it to make me more less

931
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:54,330
to work on Android phones we might

932
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:57,810
support that in the future but right now

933
00:38:54,330 --> 00:39:01,560
we we don't we don't do that in case the

934
00:38:57,810 --> 00:39:03,810
first parts to us we have I think three

935
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:06,420
or four devices actually in luging using

936
00:39:03,810 --> 00:39:07,950
hey Liam should I stay Piper's most of

937
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:10,170
them tones but we definitely appreciate

938
00:39:07,950 --> 00:39:12,060
effort if somebody ports hey Liam and

939
00:39:10,170 --> 00:39:19,250
our assistance with so yeah we should

940
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:19,250
parties do we have more questions

941
00:39:26,450 --> 00:39:34,788
thank you if it was that for the choice

942
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:39,640
of the hardware for not plan for the

943
00:39:34,789 --> 00:39:46,789
other one for present we only can choose

944
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:52,118
battery from the prime when door

945
00:39:46,789 --> 00:39:56,210
so you're locked in would set that we

946
00:39:52,119 --> 00:39:59,029
changing the practice we sorry if you

947
00:39:56,210 --> 00:40:03,109
want to change the battery you want the

948
00:39:59,029 --> 00:40:09,950
best we get then damaged and want to

949
00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:19,910
change in with the prison you can't buy

950
00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:21,950
a bundle you have talked about changing

951
00:40:19,910 --> 00:40:23,089
batteries yes so that's the pencil

952
00:40:21,950 --> 00:40:25,519
device on the other hundred you can

953
00:40:23,089 --> 00:40:27,349
change batteries about problem the point

954
00:40:25,519 --> 00:40:29,029
phone uses the standard Samson battery

955
00:40:27,349 --> 00:40:30,470
so you can just buy those start

956
00:40:29,029 --> 00:40:32,329
batteries and replace the battery in

957
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:34,819
your pint phone I'm not sure if you can

958
00:40:32,329 --> 00:40:35,960
replace it while the device is on you

959
00:40:34,819 --> 00:40:38,150
could do that with some devices to view

960
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:43,160
power them over USB swap out the battery

961
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:45,430
that kind of stuff that can work I can

962
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:45,430
tell you

963
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:57,690
on the written smart-aleck can't buy

964
00:40:53,610 --> 00:41:01,530
from another window the battery in was

965
00:40:57,690 --> 00:41:03,900
said with the hardware yeah

966
00:41:01,530 --> 00:41:05,550
the main problem with batteries is I

967
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:07,290
guess the voltage and the size of the

968
00:41:05,550 --> 00:41:09,660
battery most phones even though

969
00:41:07,290 --> 00:41:11,100
manufactures say you should not replace

970
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:13,560
the battery you can just get any other

971
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:16,140
and the world work fine if we take the

972
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:18,270
pine phone and the they basically

973
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:20,759
already set from the store they do

974
00:41:18,270 --> 00:41:23,100
support replacing battery you can get I

975
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:25,020
think a guy cj7 battery and the world

976
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:27,480
work fine and fine phone in case of lead

977
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:29,580
from five I think they used custom form

978
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:32,100
factor so field it bit hearts but the

979
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:34,170
device itself is not a reason there's no

980
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:35,880
hardware limitations on the battery it's

981
00:41:34,170 --> 00:41:38,720
just a form factor and if the voltage is

982
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:38,720
good should be fine

983
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:52,390
what's the policy for binary blobs in

984
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:54,970
post-market OS what's the policy for

985
00:41:52,390 --> 00:41:59,560
binary blobs in post-market OS do you

986
00:41:54,970 --> 00:42:04,359
really care about them the question is a

987
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:05,320
fish we care about binary blobs yeah we

988
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:08,350
prefer not to

989
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:10,480
of course when in some case some binary

990
00:42:08,350 --> 00:42:13,810
blobs or at least firmware is needed to

991
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:18,430
get the device running we do ship at

992
00:42:13,810 --> 00:42:20,590
least propriety firmware when possible

993
00:42:18,430 --> 00:42:22,540
but there are some efforts to replace a

994
00:42:20,590 --> 00:42:24,130
proprietary firmware provider blas with

995
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:26,350
open-source variants we try to use it

996
00:42:24,130 --> 00:42:28,210
wherever possible for example the the

997
00:42:26,350 --> 00:42:30,400
mali chip you in a fine phone and has

998
00:42:28,210 --> 00:42:33,970
binary blobs but we try to use Meza and

999
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:35,680
says that doesn't mean if it's actually

1000
00:42:33,970 --> 00:42:37,629
needed to get the device running yeah we

1001
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:44,080
certainly we have to what do we do

1002
00:42:37,630 --> 00:42:46,560
packages now ok thanks any more

1003
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:46,560
questions

1004
00:43:03,470 --> 00:43:10,040
I have a question about my molest them

1005
00:43:06,849 --> 00:43:16,369
does it support the old boot is original

1006
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:21,230
and 900 thermal deal hood is original

1007
00:43:16,369 --> 00:43:23,450
software currently we haven't made it

1008
00:43:21,230 --> 00:43:25,790
work with the other software that's on

1009
00:43:23,450 --> 00:43:27,770
the old and 100 like if you for example

1010
00:43:25,790 --> 00:43:31,130
take their binaries you just want to run

1011
00:43:27,770 --> 00:43:32,720
it on a molester right it doesn't work

1012
00:43:31,130 --> 00:43:34,430
I've tried it a couple times some simple

1013
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:38,359
binaries work with other things start to

1014
00:43:34,430 --> 00:43:41,930
go very wrong it uses a different API it

1015
00:43:38,359 --> 00:43:43,310
uses its army l-not arm heart float so

1016
00:43:41,930 --> 00:43:46,220
the floating-point stuffs different that

1017
00:43:43,310 --> 00:43:47,390
can still sometimes work I think if you

1018
00:43:46,220 --> 00:43:49,220
try hard enough you might be able to

1019
00:43:47,390 --> 00:43:52,960
make it work but we haven't tried that

1020
00:43:49,220 --> 00:43:52,959
hard silky

1021
00:44:00,859 --> 00:44:06,410
do we have any more questions thank you

1022
00:44:04,339 --> 00:44:14,820
very much

1023
00:44:06,410 --> 00:44:14,819
