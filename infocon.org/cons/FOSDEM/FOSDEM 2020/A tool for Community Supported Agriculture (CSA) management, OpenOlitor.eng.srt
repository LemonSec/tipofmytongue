1
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:11,840
so the clock is on

2
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:14,639
uh i'm so glad that there is that many

3
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:17,759
carrot lovers here

4
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:19,919
so this i am michael cordovia i'm gonna

5
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,240
present you about uh

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,160
this uh tool that we built for community

7
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:27,759
supported agriculture so for

8
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:30,240
uh this kind of groups uh um

9
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,439
that's basically just explain a little

10
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,440
bit the context uh

11
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,200
i don't know if you are familiarized

12
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,960
with these community supported

13
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:40,160
agricultural groups

14
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:42,640
uh basically uh maybe you're

15
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:45,038
you you have friends or maybe you

16
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,960
already joined one of them

17
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:49,440
is these groups that you get this basket

18
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:52,000
of pages

19
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,480
and then subscription base so every week

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,280
you guys

21
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,559
get a basket of pages or any other kind

22
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,680
of product

23
00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:02,879
of proximity um

24
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:06,159
that basically um is

25
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:09,920
run by a group is run by the

26
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:13,760
by the by the group and actually

27
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:15,200
it puts close uh the consumers and the

28
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,759
producers so basically

29
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,560
all the products should come from the

30
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:21,600
from from

31
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:25,119
from from closed farms and

32
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:26,720
they can actually uh rely on each other

33
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:27,600
basically they are all running the group

34
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,400
together

35
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:32,000
so one of the things that are very um

36
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,119
important is that the distribution the

37
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,040
production

38
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:37,200
is proposing this alternative model that

39
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:40,400
we are not in this big

40
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,880
idea of big supermarkets and breaking

41
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,479
those

42
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:46,158
uh those chains and basically

43
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:48,799
distributing them and making them

44
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:50,079
smaller that everyone gets closer to the

45
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,720
producer and

46
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:54,158
can also communicate to the producer and

47
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:57,280
show them their their

48
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:57,840
needs as i already mentioned normally

49
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,759
they are

50
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,000
they're running on a subscription base

51
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:04,079
so uh that gives some

52
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,360
commitment to everyone involved in the

53
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:08,079
process so basically

54
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,878
uh you cannot ask only for one week but

55
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,440
you need to be

56
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:12,879
uh committed to the group for a longer

57
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:15,599
period of time

58
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:16,480
and then the risk is shared because

59
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:19,599
basically

60
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:22,319
bad years the group will take those uh

61
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:22,720
veggies or any other kind of product we

62
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:25,119
have

63
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:27,359
we are talking about groups that they

64
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:30,319
they can distribute dairy products uh

65
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,760
fish even uh meat whatever whatever the

66
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:35,040
group decides

67
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:36,720
and so is is helping that the bad years

68
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,000
in the production for example will be

69
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:41,359
dissipated uh

70
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,640
along the the whole group members or the

71
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,959
investment in case

72
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:46,958
needs to uh the farmer needs to get more

73
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:49,280
investment or whatever you know like uh

74
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:51,280
this can be always dissipated into the

75
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,680
group

76
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,680
so these kind of groups are becoming

77
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,480
quite popular it's been already a few

78
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,599
years that we

79
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:01,359
have them all over the place and

80
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:02,640
it's very difficult to estimate how many

81
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,519
of them are in in

82
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:06,799
in europe in general because uh there

83
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:09,120
are so many

84
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:11,360
regional differences every different

85
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:14,159
country will call them in another way

86
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,640
uh the organizations that are on top of

87
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,799
of

88
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,480
that are trying to organize on a higher

89
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:21,920
level they are really

90
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:24,959
um calling things in a different way

91
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:26,399
but urgency in 2015 made this an

92
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:28,640
estimate of a

93
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,000
broad number that is around the 3 000

94
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:33,518
csas running in

95
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:36,159
europe uh this is um

96
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:37,440
this is really good it's growing in

97
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:40,239
popularity we have

98
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:41,760
uh we we are getting there you know we

99
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:43,840
are getting to a model that is

100
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,879
or we are getting to to improve the

101
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,760
model that uh

102
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:49,840
it makes those groups sustainable but

103
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,599
the main problem is that the organize

104
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,200
the organizational overhead that is

105
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:56,000
being created so

106
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,359
groups are getting bigger and bigger uh

107
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,239
you can actually imagine

108
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,120
how it is to organize a group of 350

109
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:03,439
people

110
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,159
with multiple delivery points with

111
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:07,200
multiple

112
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:10,399
uh basket types uh

113
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:12,399
in in in a city every week for example

114
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,599
it gets completely complicated very

115
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,399
complicated

116
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:17,519
and the and the overhead for volunteers

117
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:20,880
is getting really

118
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:24,240
um really a problem for this for

119
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:26,800
for this organization so uh

120
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,720
the idea that we had with some csas and

121
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,280
some other actors it was to create a

122
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,400
software

123
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:36,159
that could uh is this one openoliter

124
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:37,520
that could actually help these groups to

125
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,160
organize themselves

126
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:42,159
and to reduce this overhead because the

127
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,680
tool will help them in the in in all the

128
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,880
processes right

129
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,639
so um yeah as i already mentioned

130
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:50,240
yeah is this tool that is a web-based

131
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:54,000
tool that they can use for

132
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:56,320
for for many things the reaching of it

133
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,240
but we have for example these two guys

134
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:00,400
they were two csas that were

135
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,160
actually we wishing to have something

136
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,159
like that because their overheads were

137
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:07,360
becoming very very big

138
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:09,680
um here we we is the

139
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,680
developers and the organizations that

140
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,759
they actually uh work on

141
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,800
more on the need on a technical

142
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:18,000
perspective and we

143
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:21,280
got some funding from some

144
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,400
swiss federal government and the canton

145
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,799
so

146
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,599
that was uh four years ago when this

147
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,680
this project

148
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,759
started this was these were all the

149
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:32,720
actors involved to build this

150
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:34,320
this uh software and one the

151
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:38,400
functionalities that we

152
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:40,400
are covering uh are all all the

153
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,159
workflows that can be interesting for

154
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,719
this kind of uh

155
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,240
organization so it's managing the people

156
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:49,039
managing the subscription

157
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,000
making um the design of the delivery

158
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:53,599
plan for every

159
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,520
uh every week the invoicing

160
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,880
we also have participation module

161
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,799
because in some of those

162
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,319
groups actually is required to work a

163
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:03,440
number of hours

164
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:04,880
uh reaper creation well there are many

165
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,800
many many other

166
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,719
functionalities that they are currently

167
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,960
use and

168
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:13,199
is helping them on these processes right

169
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:14,560
um just a little bit of the architecture

170
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:17,520
that's the only technical

171
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,400
or so the technical part that i have

172
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,960
here

173
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,679
so the architecture in this uh for this

174
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,758
for this

175
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,120
tool actually we have a central server

176
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:29,280
that is actually feeding

177
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:33,120
on multiple front-ends and databases so

178
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:36,159
every csa is owner of their own css

179
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:39,440
database and uh

180
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:43,039
in order to reduce the cost and the

181
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:44,080
and the cost and the uh management the

182
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:48,400
organic

183
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:51,280
then in order to reduce the server

184
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,080
cost and the server organization

185
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,479
actually we

186
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:57,120
actually can conglomerate a lot of css

187
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:59,758
with only one server

188
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,720
like that they own their own databases

189
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:02,960
but they

190
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,000
can also share that's the main idea also

191
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:07,039
of the project

192
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,280
i mean to create a community of csas

193
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:11,199
uh that they can help each other the big

194
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:13,919
ones they can help the small ones

195
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:14,880
and they can get it running as fast as

196
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:17,039
possible

197
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,240
so the technology is behind for the

198
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:21,039
front end is

199
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,240
is angularjs and for the server is is

200
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:27,919
scala

201
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:30,080
so so the current status of this

202
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:33,039
so as i mentioned i already mentioned

203
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:36,000
this project uh started a few years ago

204
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:37,280
and uh right now we have a few groups

205
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,919
already running with it

206
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:41,359
so we have our we have eight csas in

207
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:44,240
production right now

208
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,440
that they are using it for their daily

209
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,440
business right

210
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,879
and then we have another four onboarding

211
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:51,039
csas that are

212
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:52,560
in the process of getting uh all the

213
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:55,680
data imported and

214
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:59,120
you like um getting really uh

215
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,120
to work only with the tool

216
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,799
we have overall more or less 15 people

217
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,878
working

218
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:07,440
on the project on all kinds of topics

219
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:09,360
because uh as you can imagine this

220
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,560
this this topic is a very interesting

221
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,120
topic on

222
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,919
on the perspective that we mix the

223
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,800
technology

224
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:19,039
with people that are not them they're

225
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:21,360
very interested with technology

226
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:23,199
so uh we have a lot of people making the

227
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,000
link we had a lot of people working on

228
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:26,879
it

229
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,879
which was absolutely great it was

230
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:31,440
translated already at six languages

231
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:34,159
and uh after this talk i hope another

232
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:36,320
two or three will come right

233
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:37,519
and then about the current numbers we

234
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:40,240
already deliver

235
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:41,679
more than a hundred thousand baskets

236
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,839
over those years

237
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:45,839
and we have three more than 3 000

238
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:47,360
deliveries uh

239
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:50,480
you know like it's it's really it's

240
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:54,320
really running and making

241
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:56,800
easier processes for them

242
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,600
one very big topic that we have now in

243
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,399
our mind

244
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,040
is how we make it sustainable because

245
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:03,200
it's uh

246
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:05,040
quite difficult to maintain this kind of

247
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,279
projects but you will know

248
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,800
from the perspective of open source

249
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:11,839
right

250
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:14,000
so we we are actually to

251
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:16,399
trying to design the same kind of model

252
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,800
that the css are offering so

253
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:19,680
basically in a csa everyone is sharing

254
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,880
risks

255
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:25,839
and every every participant is trying to

256
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:27,600
voice is requested to have a commitment

257
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:31,120
the idea here is the same

258
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:33,839
every csa could participate uh inside a

259
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,560
a bigger group and they can share the

260
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,200
hosting

261
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,599
cost the whole the hosting work they

262
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,720
couldn't

263
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:43,760
they could share or um they could share

264
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:45,680
according also to their size uh in a way

265
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,519
that actually the bigger

266
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:49,439
actors they are helping and promoting

267
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:52,000
the smaller actors to go a little bit

268
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,760
you like to go up and being able to

269
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,279
organize themselves in a more efficient

270
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:59,040
way right

271
00:09:55,279 --> 00:10:01,760
uh yes so um

272
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,880
and just one of the last point is how

273
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,920
are we organized

274
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:08,000
at the moment this project

275
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,959
was originally created in switzerland

276
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,040
for these

277
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:13,518
two particular csas that were explained

278
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:17,120
in their needs right

279
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:19,839
but we had the contact uh

280
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,640
to other people in different places so

281
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:23,200
we created

282
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:25,760
this uh informal organization that is

283
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:30,640
open literature international we try to

284
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:32,640
meet once a year sorry

285
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,480
where everyone is invited every people

286
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,680
that is interested is invited that they

287
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,760
have to talk about the

288
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:39,599
new lines and where are we moving the

289
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:42,399
software and who is interested

290
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:44,480
um which models can we cover with them

291
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:47,600
all kind of talk

292
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:49,760
then we have the official non-profit uh

293
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,720
organization in switzerland to manage

294
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:54,319
all the legal

295
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:57,680
uh aspects um we are running

296
00:10:54,320 --> 00:11:01,120
um we are actually hosting and running

297
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:03,439
uh for the eight csas that i mentioned

298
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,800
so we have an organization that is

299
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:07,920
helping them to do

300
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:10,000
all the hosting work and then uh

301
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,279
at the moment sunu has been working with

302
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,920
us for already two

303
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:17,920
three years um promoting uh csa's

304
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:20,800
digitalization uh in germany

305
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,199
uh and they picked up an auditor from

306
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,160
for

307
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,880
for promoting this digitalization in in

308
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:28,079
in the different

309
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:32,240
in in germany

310
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:35,120
so um how guys you get involved

311
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,440
that's the the very interesting question

312
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:39,040
so

313
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,600
um basically um as i already mentioned

314
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,920
this

315
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,680
this this project it has a very very

316
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:45,360
interesting part that is

317
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,800
really technical people working with

318
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,399
non-technical people

319
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,079
and trying to make it work that it

320
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:52,480
actually helps everyone

321
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:54,800
so uh that's a for me it's a point that

322
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:58,079
is very interesting i never worked in an

323
00:11:54,800 --> 00:12:00,399
in in a setup like that really

324
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:01,279
um yeah at the moment it's becoming

325
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:03,839
quite

326
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:05,439
multilingual we are people from a few

327
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:08,079
countries in europe and is

328
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,639
uh getting very interesting on on this

329
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:12,560
level

330
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:14,800
at this level um obviously those groups

331
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:16,160
they cannot is for them is a very big

332
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:19,519
effort to basically

333
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:22,079
um on board any kind of digital solution

334
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:24,160
so for them their their point of view is

335
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:25,920
always long term there is no option that

336
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,680
they can change every three months so

337
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,519
that's not an option so

338
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,199
it gives some stability to the project

339
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:34,560
that is actually very interesting

340
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:35,920
and uh as uh as you can imagine the the

341
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:38,560
spectrum of tasks

342
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:39,360
is incredible you can really from the

343
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:43,518
from the field

344
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:46,079
uh to uh to make more kind of

345
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:46,800
promotion of the tool or to code or to

346
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:49,920
translate

347
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,839
there is all kind of of tasks that needs

348
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:55,439
to be done

349
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:58,560
right and that's pretty much everything

350
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:07,279
i nailed it two minutes

351
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:09,359
so you know

352
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:11,200
so if you have any questions or

353
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,320
basically you can go here you have a

354
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,320
little bit of

355
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,680
the three main websites where you can

356
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:21,839
get more information

357
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:21,839
or you can write us uh directly on uh

358
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:35,839
it was a farmer right

359
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:35,839
in latin so it's a open farmer

360
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:42,000
actually payment itself is not supported

361
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:42,959
but we can do the tracking of the

362
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,160
payment

363
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:48,479
so sepa tracking is

364
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:51,600
is enabled and also the equivalent in

365
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,600
switzerland at the moment

366
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,439
will it scale to the extent where the

367
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,319
whole country's pretty much the whole

368
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:59,519
country is using

369
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:01,680
it sorry sorry again will it scale

370
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:03,360
to the to a level which will support

371
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:06,399
everybody shopping this way

372
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:08,399
yes well actually you're like that's the

373
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:10,560
as i mentioned you know like one server

374
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:14,320
can come actually

375
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:17,920
provides several csas uh um

376
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:18,800
the idea is in case it the scalability

377
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:22,160
is possible

378
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:24,560
it's you can we don't promote

379
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:26,639
we like the idea that they create kind

380
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,599
of communities that they can support

381
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:30,240
each other but

382
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,880
we we can have a big actor that actually

383
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:34,160
scale

384
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:37,279
and really goes uh for a really

385
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:40,880
big number of csas yeah

386
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:43,920
uh yeah hi thank you

387
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:45,439
um are you aware of the project called

388
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:48,880
enter thailand

389
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:51,839
sharing the harvest which is actually

390
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:53,279
dealing with the fact that people need

391
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:54,959
to find farmers

392
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:58,639
and farmers need to find people in the

393
00:14:54,959 --> 00:15:01,359
cities is that something you also do or

394
