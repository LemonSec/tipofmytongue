1
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:11,130
so it's 11 so let's start welcome to

2
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:17,830
March

3
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:20,770
[Applause]

4
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:25,299
my name is Thomas brass I work in Red

5
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:28,240
Hat check in Brno in Czech Republic and

6
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:33,040
I am a principal software engineer in

7
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:36,400
the crypto crypto team basically we work

8
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:40,089
about all the cryptic technologies in

9
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:45,089
Red Hat Enterprise Linux and also fedora

10
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:48,850
of course what we'll be discussing today

11
00:00:45,089 --> 00:00:50,610
we start with some motivation we will

12
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:54,600
talk about crypto policies in general

13
00:00:50,610 --> 00:01:01,960
about custom crypto policies which is a

14
00:00:54,600 --> 00:01:03,909
new addition to this tool and we will

15
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:06,460
also talk about we will show some

16
00:01:03,909 --> 00:01:08,429
examples of custom crypto policies we

17
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:13,559
will talk about future a little and

18
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:18,310
early summary for the motivation

19
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:25,030
cryptography and cryptanalysis goes

20
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:29,170
hand-in-hand and basically the evolution

21
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:33,130
of algorithms and protocols is faster

22
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:36,460
and faster you can never be sure fully

23
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:39,759
sure that once you deploy something that

24
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:43,089
in like next year you it will be secure

25
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:46,990
enough so you need to accommodate for

26
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:50,009
the changes here is some example of

27
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:54,759
change changing technology in terms of

28
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:58,060
crypto protocols TLS you can see here

29
00:01:54,759 --> 00:02:01,299
how the protocols were when the

30
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:03,700
protocols were standardized and when

31
00:02:01,299 --> 00:02:08,550
they were insecure that's basically

32
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:11,170
where they're aligned stop to be full

33
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:12,730
where they found to be insecure of

34
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:16,899
course they were insecure from start but

35
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:19,179
nobody know that so we currently have

36
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:22,000
still one point two which is fairly

37
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:27,250
secure still and one point three is new

38
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,520
thing so you have some pretty nice

39
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:35,260
guides

40
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:40,070
to set up your web server ssh server

41
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:44,390
whatever other application how to set up

42
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:48,890
in so it's very very secure and uses the

43
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:52,339
up-to-date algorithms and protocols and

44
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:57,019
so on but these guides here is one of

45
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:59,360
the example are very very long and you

46
00:02:57,020 --> 00:03:03,890
have to go through then setup change

47
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:09,020
configuration files so on what if you

48
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:10,600
need to apply these crypto settings and

49
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:15,590
changes for the current configuration

50
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:17,960
regularly to like hundreds of machines

51
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:23,240
various various kinds of machines on

52
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:26,270
your on your network and some of them up

53
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:31,010
virtual machines maybe and containers or

54
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:34,160
whatever and the other thing to

55
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:36,890
complicate things even more by Rashmi

56
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:40,490
various machines usually have different

57
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:46,899
needs or levels of needs to communicate

58
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:50,030
with legacy devices various old hardware

59
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:53,630
Cisco boxes I don't know what you what

60
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:57,290
you can have on your network click the

61
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:59,570
course policies came to rescue because

62
00:03:57,290 --> 00:04:02,870
they send our centrally managed on the

63
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:05,269
system they provide you multiple

64
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:08,840
pre-designed policy levels and they also

65
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:12,080
simplify flips support if you care about

66
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:17,440
it if you are Enterprise want to sell to

67
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:17,440
US government or related institutions

68
00:04:17,769 --> 00:04:22,669
central what mean what does it mean it's

69
00:04:20,298 --> 00:04:25,609
central managed on the system there is a

70
00:04:22,669 --> 00:04:29,180
single command update crypto policies -

71
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:35,419
they're set and you provide a level you

72
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:40,479
want to set on your system it this

73
00:04:35,419 --> 00:04:40,479
single command manage manages

74
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:44,509
configuration for

75
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:47,030
all these crypto core crypto libraries

76
00:04:44,509 --> 00:04:50,979
as they're called as we call them and

77
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:58,400
although some applications on the on the

78
00:04:50,979 --> 00:05:01,310
fedora or rel system is basically all

79
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:06,469
the core libraries that that are used by

80
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:11,539
the by the base based system

81
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:17,379
applications so when the update crypto

82
00:05:11,539 --> 00:05:20,750
policies command runs it transforms a

83
00:05:17,379 --> 00:05:22,669
simple policy definition file into

84
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:28,969
separate configuration file snippets

85
00:05:22,669 --> 00:05:31,068
that are loaded and or included by the

86
00:05:28,969 --> 00:05:37,210
configuration files of these libraries

87
00:05:31,069 --> 00:05:41,090
or applications let's talk about the

88
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:43,150
levels that we provide which we are like

89
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:48,758
kind of pre-designed

90
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:54,460
the most lenient level is legacy which

91
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:58,250
provides you 64-bit security about its

92
00:05:54,460 --> 00:06:01,159
it also enables rc4 and three days but

93
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:04,210
only for some applications for the

94
00:06:01,159 --> 00:06:07,430
applications or libraries where we

95
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:08,180
decided that it's not longer relevant at

96
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:11,270
all

97
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:13,669
it's it's also disabled Fergie's the

98
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:18,139
default level here are the levels for

99
00:06:13,669 --> 00:06:21,430
fedora actually the default level still

100
00:06:18,139 --> 00:06:29,659
enables TLS 1.0 until at one point one

101
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:32,180
but disables all the rc4 and the next

102
00:06:29,659 --> 00:06:34,430
policy level which is actually the

103
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:41,000
default for Red Hat Enterprise Linux

104
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:43,990
eight enables only TLS 1.2 and it also

105
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:47,750
requires diffie-hellman parameters to be

106
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:53,029
larger and two kilobits the same for RSA

107
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:55,470
and DSA but there was at the time when

108
00:06:53,029 --> 00:06:58,230
when we started

109
00:06:55,470 --> 00:07:01,830
for federate was like not acceptable

110
00:06:58,230 --> 00:07:05,670
because it still broke some websites but

111
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:08,130
I suppose that in the next release we

112
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:12,480
will drop or change the default for

113
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:14,430
fedora as well to this level the future

114
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:17,370
level is kind of special because it

115
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:23,570
allows you to test whether your

116
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:26,580
application or system or whatever is

117
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:29,219
prepared for some some of the future

118
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:31,020
changes of course it cannot enable

119
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:35,460
things that are not implemented in the

120
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:39,659
libraries but it at least drop support

121
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:43,799
for 128-bit symmetric ciphers which

122
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:46,310
basically in this particular part it

123
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:50,850
will prepare you for post quantum

124
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:53,460
situation and the fifth policy is

125
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:56,880
special because it removes support for

126
00:07:53,460 --> 00:08:03,299
all algorithms that are not approved for

127
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:05,070
phase so and the simplification of the

128
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:09,210
FIPS mode with the crypto policies is

129
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:12,420
provided also by having just a single

130
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:18,510
command that will enable the system FIPS

131
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:20,430
mode for you because previously for

132
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:23,190
example on rather than to price linux

133
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:25,980
seven or older releases you had to

134
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:29,610
follow a few steps that you would have

135
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:32,190
to do to enable the system FIPS mode now

136
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:39,840
we will just promising low current entry

137
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:44,220
boot so to summarize the system crypto

138
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:45,900
policies provide central management of

139
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:47,790
the system by single command that

140
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:51,030
controls all the core crypto libraries

141
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:52,650
and applications using crypto there are

142
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:55,319
multiple parties and pleasure levels

143
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:57,390
which provide up-to-date security also

144
00:08:55,320 --> 00:09:00,060
communication with legacy systems or

145
00:08:57,390 --> 00:09:01,779
preparation for future and there is a

146
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:06,518
fifth support

147
00:09:01,779 --> 00:09:10,389
in provided as well and simplification

148
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:13,180
of it ships moat and emblem and and when

149
00:09:10,389 --> 00:09:19,060
you can where you can get these this

150
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:20,560
tool on current federal reversions all

151
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:23,729
the supported for reversions

152
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:27,189
and rather than the price in book state

153
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:30,810
but what if the predefined policy levels

154
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:30,810
don't match your requirements

155
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:36,339
now custom crypto policies come to

156
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:43,410
rescue which is a new improvement of

157
00:09:36,339 --> 00:09:47,709
this tool with this feature you can

158
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:50,350
define your own crypto policies from

159
00:09:47,709 --> 00:09:53,319
scratch or more if you can modify

160
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:57,519
existing predefined policy levels how to

161
00:09:53,319 --> 00:09:58,930
do that with when you define your full

162
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:04,839
policy from scratch

163
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:07,930
you place all the place the full policy

164
00:10:04,839 --> 00:10:11,319
definition file into this one of these

165
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:15,459
two directories and the file needs to be

166
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:17,860
named policy that dot Paul with the

167
00:10:15,459 --> 00:10:21,459
uppercase in the name in the file name

168
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:26,199
is important because otherwise the two

169
00:10:21,459 --> 00:10:29,469
won't recognize it the format of the

170
00:10:26,199 --> 00:10:31,899
file is kind of simple although you of

171
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:37,180
course have to know the names of the of

172
00:10:31,899 --> 00:10:42,100
the algorithms but as you can see here

173
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:45,579
you have hash it's a simple like key

174
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:49,750
equals volume format where most of the

175
00:10:45,579 --> 00:10:53,138
volume values are lists of algorithm

176
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:57,810
names such as here we can have all the

177
00:10:53,139 --> 00:10:57,810
various hash algorithms

178
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:04,939
this is actually excerpt from user share

179
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:09,440
crypto policies policies future pool and

180
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:14,020
provide as you can see only shot to and

181
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:17,300
Shari hashes are enabled future policy

182
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:20,649
here is the setting for key key

183
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:26,000
exchanges the group this is the group

184
00:11:20,649 --> 00:11:31,750
key again you can see here that these

185
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:38,020
are Dan bears or the safe crypto cars

186
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:38,020
and here are normal list curves and

187
00:11:39,339 --> 00:11:47,450
normal deficient

188
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:49,399
meters of these lines and in future

189
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:52,610
policy you can see the minimum dealers

190
00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:56,440
version is one point two minimum size of

191
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:59,810
the RSA keys are three killed kilobits

192
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:02,600
of course there are other values for

193
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:14,000
symmetric ciphers signage shrubbery

194
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:17,570
things other other parameters but you

195
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:20,810
might probably not want to design your

196
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:23,870
policy from scratch with full policy

197
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:28,939
from scratch one of the reasons why not

198
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:32,950
to do that is because the various crypto

199
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:38,500
backends have or the the way how the

200
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:41,890
policy is transformed into the actual

201
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:44,690
configurations file for the libraries

202
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:46,579
has some limitations basically the

203
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:49,160
limitations are due to the way how the

204
00:12:46,579 --> 00:12:52,969
libraries are being configured we did

205
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:55,610
not like we added some some changes but

206
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:57,920
we did not try to like really really

207
00:12:55,610 --> 00:13:00,649
arrangement all the configurations for

208
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:03,199
for all the libraries so so there are

209
00:13:00,649 --> 00:13:05,370
definitely some limitations on what you

210
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:08,520
can set with one library and

211
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:11,990
another and for that reason it might be

212
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:15,030
a good idea to just modify existing

213
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:19,610
existing policy with with the so-called

214
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:22,589
policy modifier module these modules

215
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:27,810
need to be placed into the modules

216
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:31,830
subdirectory and they have a different

217
00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:36,989
sub suffix P mode again the uppercase in

218
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:38,940
the name of the module is important so

219
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:42,750
here will be some examples of the

220
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:49,500
modifiers for example you can disable

221
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:54,410
sha-1 hash you just basically apply

222
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:58,680
these changes to the original policy

223
00:13:54,410 --> 00:14:01,439
that means - sha-1 means remove shaaban

224
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:05,550
from the list of the hash algorithms

225
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:07,860
- Parris IPSS sha-1 RSA Chauhan ECDSA

226
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:10,050
Chauhan remove these signature

227
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:16,050
algorithms from the list of sign

228
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:24,240
algorithms in the base policy how to

229
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:31,920
apply this modifier basically with this

230
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:36,510
command you append with : no shovin you

231
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:39,900
append it to the base policy and the

232
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:42,030
policy will be modified accordingly you

233
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:44,730
can of course there is no limitation on

234
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:47,640
if you have a module on which base

235
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:50,220
policy you apply it can be applied on

236
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:52,290
any other policy like future but in

237
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:55,530
future for future policy it has no

238
00:14:52,290 --> 00:15:01,260
effect because there is already the

239
00:14:55,530 --> 00:15:06,000
sha-1 is already disabled there another

240
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:12,780
example by default camellia is enabled

241
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:19,140
only for like non TLS applications or

242
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:19,529
protocols with this plus name of the

243
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:23,689
other

244
00:15:19,529 --> 00:15:29,730
you add edit to the list of the enabled

245
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:31,980
algorithms for TLS here

246
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:34,560
just for there is no problem if you just

247
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:37,050
if there in the base policy if the

248
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:40,170
Camellia is already enabled if you edit

249
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:41,180
again there is no like error or no

250
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:45,329
problem with that

251
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:48,300
so it's a good idea to buy to be for

252
00:15:45,329 --> 00:15:55,378
sure that I enable it everywhere I put

253
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:59,279
it for both TLS and non TLS ciphers the

254
00:15:55,379 --> 00:16:01,199
other option is to put the plus on after

255
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:05,699
the name of the algorithm we just

256
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:08,959
changes the order where the algorithms

257
00:16:05,699 --> 00:16:11,339
output because if you put the plus bit

258
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:13,498
before the name of the algorithm it will

259
00:16:11,339 --> 00:16:16,470
be inserted on the beginning of the list

260
00:16:13,499 --> 00:16:20,850
if you put it at the end of the

261
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:25,920
algorithm name it will be put lost or

262
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:28,410
appended to the list you can for example

263
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:33,479
disable all TLS protocol versions in

264
00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:36,389
legacy policy by these settings there is

265
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:38,100
a kind of duplication because some of

266
00:16:36,389 --> 00:16:41,850
the back ends of the libraries don't

267
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:44,519
allow to selectively disable protocol by

268
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:47,399
protocol and for these back ends there

269
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:52,079
is the mentalist version or mainly TLS

270
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:58,050
version for the others you can like

271
00:16:52,079 --> 00:17:02,489
selectively use this list to disable all

272
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:05,879
the cause you don't want SSS tree by the

273
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:08,579
way or they like dropped remove disabled

274
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:12,890
no no no need to disable it anywhere

275
00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:19,709
because it's already dropped from the

276
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:22,079
libraries here is another example - just

277
00:17:19,709 --> 00:17:24,870
make the future police a little bit more

278
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:27,430
lenient because by default or most of

279
00:17:24,869 --> 00:17:32,459
the websites have only two k2

280
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:35,680
it's RSA keys for certificates and so

281
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:37,990
this is the most probable reason why if

282
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:40,660
you set future policy you won't be able

283
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:43,390
to connect on too many websites so you

284
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:47,620
could adjust your future the future

285
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:50,800
policy with this modifier and you would

286
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:53,080
be probably almost possible to use for

287
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:59,200
future policy for like regular web

288
00:17:53,080 --> 00:18:03,129
browsing or you can only allow for

289
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:08,380
example ECD edge and ECD edge with

290
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:12,820
pressure keys this is basically the

291
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:19,090
situation for open SSL on TLS 1.30

292
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:29,139
already because it does not support the

293
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:36,429
f FD h groups on TLS 1.3 and it supports

294
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:39,400
only forward secrecy enabling changes so

295
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:41,200
this by this way you just remove all the

296
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:47,920
remaining algorithms from the key

297
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:51,370
exchange there is a kind of deficiency

298
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:53,290
because what would be logical more

299
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:56,080
logical would be to have the policy

300
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:59,080
modifier to just set the ECD H and H th

301
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:06,570
PSK to key exchange but the current

302
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:09,790
version doesn't support this yeah and

303
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:12,540
the policy modifiers can be applied like

304
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:18,040
multiple policy modifiers can be applied

305
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:23,190
at once so basically you just put all

306
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:23,190
these one after another

307
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:32,290
the important thing to understand is

308
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:35,260
that the the generation of the actual

309
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:38,889
configuration files for the libraries is

310
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:40,750
done at the configure time basically

311
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:47,500
when you run the update crypto policies

312
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:56,400
script this is important because this

313
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:59,950
allows for like changing changing things

314
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:05,170
in new versions of the update crypto

315
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:07,560
policies for example OpenSSL back and

316
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:09,520
could allow a more fine-grained

317
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:15,760
selection of the algorithms because

318
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:19,480
currently it's kind of simple and or

319
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:22,180
even new back-end could be added to

320
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:25,210
support to be supported for example we

321
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:30,630
can we are planning to have for example

322
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:34,090
go language support it with a separate

323
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:39,700
configuration so you would you would not

324
00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:42,780
need to like regenerate your policy

325
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:44,730
files or whatever you would just by

326
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:49,330
automatically on the upgrade of the

327
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:57,070
package the configuration was updated

328
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:59,260
and so to summarize with custom crypto

329
00:20:57,070 --> 00:21:02,740
policies you can define your crypto

330
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:05,080
policy from scratch in the way in a

331
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:08,370
simple policy definition file or you can

332
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:11,230
modify existing predefined policy levels

333
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:16,060
by adding or removing enable algorithms

334
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:18,190
or protocols and the generation of

335
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:21,870
back-end configurations is done when

336
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:28,600
objective the policy script is around

337
00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:33,459
the future plans one big thing had is

338
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:35,139
handling of shavon deprecation this is

339
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:37,140
one of the reasons why I need why we

340
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:43,300
need to change

341
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:45,610
back end for OpenSSL we need to be able

342
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:53,110
to basically selectively disable shavon

343
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:55,179
currently this is not possible and yeah

344
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:58,629
that's basically what I've already

345
00:21:55,180 --> 00:22:01,360
talked about the fine-grain back end

346
00:21:58,630 --> 00:22:04,210
configurations for new TLS is already

347
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:08,199
improved it was in previous versions if

348
00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:13,660
it was on the more similar ladder to

349
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:16,660
open SSL and yeah we would like to at

350
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:18,880
some point to think about data at rest

351
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:22,030
support but that's much harder topic

352
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:25,840
currently mostly the crypto policies

353
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:31,780
affect only the protocol usage for

354
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:34,629
algorithms in data in transit so quick

355
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:38,230
summary single command to rule them all

356
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:40,060
the algorithms and libraries multi

357
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:42,790
prepare assign codes political levels

358
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:45,010
custom crypto policies can be created

359
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:47,190
from scratch by policy modification and

360
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:48,520
very simple policy definition format

361
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:57,220
thank you

362
00:22:48,520 --> 00:23:00,129
any questions do these policies also pi2

363
00:22:57,220 --> 00:23:02,860
containers running on the operating

364
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:04,930
system they would apply to containers

365
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:07,419
only if you if you inside the container

366
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:11,170
you have the system with with the the

367
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:15,220
policies basically if you have federer

368
00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:21,070
inside the container then or or l.a you

369
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:23,400
will have crypto policies the depends on

370
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:23,399
your use case

371
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:38,140
is there any support to distinguish

372
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:43,090
between client and server connections so

373
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:44,380
say you're trying to insist that clients

374
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:46,000
connect to your service with this

375
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:47,110
particular level but then your service

376
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,950
then has to connect to another service

377
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:53,290
with a different level so make sense

378
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:55,300
like it means what legacy system say if

379
00:23:53,290 --> 00:23:57,070
you if you have like multiple systems

380
00:23:55,300 --> 00:24:00,129
gonna like but just between the

381
00:23:57,070 --> 00:24:01,870
connecting client and then say you say

382
00:24:00,130 --> 00:24:04,120
your service has to include connects

383
00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:06,040
another legacy service which has a you

384
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:08,590
can't control the the crypto you can use

385
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:10,780
on it yeah can you define a policy for

386
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:12,610
the incoming connections to be at a high

387
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:18,070
level say for the clients on the general

388
00:24:12,610 --> 00:24:20,080
internet I don't understand the question

389
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:22,149
really but basically the policies

390
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:25,030
applied to this whole system they don't

391
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:27,640
like selectively apply to servers

392
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:30,399
clients whatever that they are like kind

393
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:41,770
of general things to be simple right for

394
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:43,810
the admin too so so if you have any

395
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:44,760
questions for your I will answer it

396
00:24:43,810 --> 00:24:48,079
outside

397
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:48,079
[Applause]

398
00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:53,360
you

399
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:53,360
[Applause]
