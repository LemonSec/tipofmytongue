1
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:08,879
so

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,080
um our our next talk is going to be uh

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,519
marius kento from the

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:15,759
open scad project so um without

5
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:17,580
further ado uh help me give a warm

6
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:22,640
welcome to marius

7
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:25,919
[Applause]

8
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,359
okay thanks ed so uh yeah i'm marius i'm

9
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,840
the maintainer of openscad

10
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,400
a lot of people say openscad it's fine

11
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:32,719
but uh

12
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:35,360
we try to say openscad and it sounds

13
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:39,200
less like an open wound

14
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:40,559
so um uh so openscad is a very small

15
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,120
community of people

16
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:45,039
we are practically two main developers

17
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,239
as me and forced them to sit on the back

18
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:47,760
here

19
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:50,000
and a handful of people who helps out

20
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:53,120
with community management

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,559
and mailing lists and

22
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,640
writes called from time to time with

23
00:00:54,559 --> 00:01:00,239
whenever their jobs

24
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,559
lets them uh we also have participated

25
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:04,319
in

26
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:06,720
uh google summer of code uh

27
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:08,080
for a number of years together with uh

28
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,439
brlcad

29
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,760
and they also participate in google

30
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:12,960
summer of talks at google system docs

31
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,360
last autumn that

32
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,080
has been very great um and we have

33
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,720
survived for

34
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,200
more than ten years which is great so

35
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,600
that's

36
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,040
uh and people still use it and that's

37
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,880
that's amazing and that's why we keep

38
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:28,240
doing it

39
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:30,000
and uh we also openness tends to kind of

40
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,600
show up in all these kind of top 10 3d

41
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,759
modeling tools for 3d printing

42
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,360
lists and maybe even after this talk it

43
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:38,159
will help you understand kind of

44
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,880
what the role opener sched plays today

45
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,079
and

46
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:43,520
and why it exists uh so

47
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:44,798
for those who don't know about this

48
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,079
project i'll just give a really really

49
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:48,159
quick overview

50
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:49,679
over the project and then talk a little

51
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:51,040
bit about

52
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,840
the title here which is designing

53
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,000
functional objects with functional

54
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:57,040
objects

55
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,799
so first of all openscad

56
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:01,759
in one sentence it's a domain-specific

57
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:04,079
language

58
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:05,280
for doing 3d modeling using constructive

59
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:07,360
solid geometry

60
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,318
and it comes with a really lightweight

61
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,598
ide

62
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:11,359
and they just cover that really really

63
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:13,920
quickly so

64
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,360
this is hello world in openscad it's

65
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,480
literally a sphere

66
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,319
parentheses semicolon this

67
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,519
is often in the open scan lingu called

68
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:24,560
to instantiate

69
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:27,520
a module to create a shape

70
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:29,040
and you can instantiate other other

71
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,080
objects that are built in to create more

72
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,440
shapes

73
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:36,160
or if you want to do something more

74
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:37,840
complex for instance

75
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,440
a spiritual hole in it that is

76
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,920
equivalent to taking the difference

77
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:43,040
between

78
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:45,440
a sphere and the cylinder and

79
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,879
and for and it's this is the obnescat

80
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:49,040
syntax

81
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:50,640
and for this reason kind of openness cat

82
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,359
is often called the description language

83
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,238
because you just

84
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,120
describe objects so in the same way as

85
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:56,560
as html

86
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,319
it doesn't have any kind of concept of

87
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,120
time you don't execute from top to

88
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:02,238
bottom it's just

89
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:04,080
there also

90
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:06,080
it has zero boilerplate so you write

91
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:09,200
this you get it there's no build system

92
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,319
you just type this in and you get so uh

93
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,799
and that's going to be really important

94
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:15,599
for a lot of people that you're on

95
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,959
csg it's a very kind of classic old

96
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:19,040
concept

97
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:20,400
in short you basically start with solid

98
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,920
primitives

99
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,760
and then you perform certain operations

100
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,679
on those primitives and those operations

101
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,640
are defined in a way so that the result

102
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,680
of the operation

103
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:31,200
the object is still solid and and the

104
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:35,599
classic operations

105
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:39,440
in csg are unions intersections and and

106
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:40,079
differences and so how it works that you

107
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,280
basically

108
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,280
your leaf nodes are going to be your

109
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,519
primitives and then you kind of

110
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,280
you hierarchically build up a more and

111
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:48,400
more complex object by performing these

112
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,840
operations

113
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,000
and then the root node of the or the

114
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,280
tree is going to be your final shape

115
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,120
and this is this is what the openscad

116
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,519
does kind of by that you express using

117
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,480
this

118
00:03:55,519 --> 00:04:00,000
this domain specific language so we have

119
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,280
a bunch of these primitives not just at

120
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
standard primitives you can create your

121
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:06,400
own primitives you can import primitives

122
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,360
uh we have 2d primitives including q

123
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,920
typed text

124
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,599
and you can import svgs and you can use

125
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,280
those 2d primitives to create

126
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:15,119
more 3d primitives through various

127
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:18,238
extrusions

128
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:20,239
all using this language and we also have

129
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:21,679
in addition to the three classic csg

130
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:23,919
operators we have a bunch of other

131
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,759
operators that you can use

132
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:27,039
and some of these are operators that are

133
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:31,360
really hard to

134
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:32,880
to do in classic b rep modeling

135
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,080
but we are also a language so we have

136
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,600
all the classic on the language

137
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,680
constructs we have

138
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,040
control flow we have variables we have

139
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,960
list comprehensions

140
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,960
we have for loops we have built-in

141
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,159
functions and you can use you can define

142
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,599
your own functions

143
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,199
you can define your old shapes shapes

144
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,600
can be recursive

145
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:51,040
uh you can include and use libraries so

146
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,080
it's just like a it's a full-fledged

147
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,800
language but it's not

148
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:56,159
it is still a domain specific specific

149
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,000
language so it stays in

150
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,759
in your own sandbox you can't create a

151
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,400
web server and you don't want to create

152
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:02,400
a web server

153
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:08,320
and so people tend to use openscad to

154
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,759
create

155
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:13,440
what they call parametric designs and

156
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:15,199
in this context parametric designs are

157
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,759
not kind of mathematical parametrization

158
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:19,520
it's more

159
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:21,280
free-form logical parametrization so

160
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,960
if you want to say to create like a lego

161
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:26,719
brick you would typically

162
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:29,520
create a module in openscad

163
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,240
with a name and a bunch of parameters

164
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:33,359
and

165
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:36,160
then you or users of your your library

166
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:39,840
or module can then instantiate this

167
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:41,199
object and to get your designs

168
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,119
and you can change your parameters to

169
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:43,759
get different kind of various variants

170
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,240
of this

171
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:48,000
of this design uh and it doesn't have to

172
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,880
be kind of the same shape really just

173
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,120
really logical

174
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:52,159
a way of collecting different related

175
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,880
designs into one

176
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:56,639
package and this is a very very common

177
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,639
way of using open scans to

178
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:00,400
to abstract everything into a module and

179
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,160
then you instantiate that module

180
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:06,318
and then you can package inside library

181
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:08,560
and so other people can use it

182
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:09,759
and we also have a really really basic

183
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,759
ide so

184
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:13,039
our id is a practice text editor with a

185
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:15,440
3d view

186
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:17,039
and a bunch of buttons and menus that

187
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,680
are used for all the ephemeral stuff

188
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:19,360
right because

189
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,880
when you save this file only the stuff

190
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,080
that is written in text will be saved

191
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,680
everything else is just kind of

192
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,650
moving cameras around so you can look at

193
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,039
it

194
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:28,880
[Music]

195
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:30,479
and we do have a command line version

196
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:33,440
that has all the features of the

197
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:34,080
ui so for those who like to use the

198
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,719
command line

199
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:39,039
you just input the file and you output

200
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,400
whatever you want to update

201
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:42,479
a lot of people also like to use their

202
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,679
own favorite text editors in which case

203
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:45,280
we have support for that you can hide

204
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,919
this editor and it will auto reload

205
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,960
whenever

206
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:51,758
the file changes on this

207
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:54,000
so that was kind of really quickly in

208
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:56,800
seven minutes what openscad is

209
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,880
uh so let's talk a little bit about

210
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,880
designing functional objects

211
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:03,680
um this is more like our historic view

212
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:07,039
of openscad why why we started it

213
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:09,039
so when i see a 3d printer i don't

214
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:11,599
i don't think rapid prototyping i think

215
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:14,240
kind of personal digital manufacturing

216
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:15,680
and to me that means a few things first

217
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,880
of all

218
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:21,039
when you design a 3d design that the

219
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,479
amount of time you put into that design

220
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:24,080
very often needs to be proportional to

221
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:25,120
the value of a single physical object of

222
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,359
that type

223
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,400
so you can't hire content sign engineers

224
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,000
to spend kind of

225
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:32,318
days and weeks on designing something

226
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,919
you have to do it yourself

227
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:35,919
do it yourself means that people who

228
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:37,680
design stuff are not design engineers

229
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:39,359
they have minimal or no training and

230
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,440
classic design tools or classic design

231
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,360
paradigms

232
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:45,120
and three objects don't have to be

233
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,879
pretty they just have to work in many

234
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,720
cases

235
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:52,400
and that's very very different from when

236
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:55,360
you design for manufacturing

237
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:57,039
and so a lot of people have other needs

238
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,520
for this right i mean but enough people

239
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:59,599
kind of

240
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:01,198
have needs in in this domain that it's

241
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:02,080
it's worth pursuing this idea of kind of

242
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:03,599
pure functional

243
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,800
the science that doesn't have to be

244
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:06,800
pretty and those have to be mass

245
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:09,599
manufacturable

246
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,879
and so we so in the context of openscad

247
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:12,560
so when we started this project

248
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:14,240
this kind of grew directly out of the

249
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,759
the reprap project

250
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,240
which is kind of creating a 3d printer

251
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:20,319
that prints itself

252
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:23,039
it also grew out of hackerspace culture

253
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:26,720
in particular the meta lab in vienna

254
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:27,919
and it grew to the free software culture

255
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,080
and when we started this we had these

256
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:31,758
explicit goals that

257
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,679
that the main goal was that make it

258
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:35,279
easier for non-designers to design for

259
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:37,120
3d printing

260
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:38,719
and we come with assignment for

261
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,719
ourselves and

262
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:42,159
since we were programmers we kind of

263
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:43,360
made it easier for programmers to design

264
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:45,519
for two different things

265
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,120
but uh interestingly enough that kind of

266
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:49,040
a lot of non-programmers ends up using

267
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:51,519
the the tool

268
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,319
uh because because the language is so

269
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:55,680
easy to

270
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:57,440
to express ideas in um

271
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,040
and the other the second goal was that

272
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:01,519
we wanted to focus on

273
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:03,439
creating simple and functional objects

274
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:05,519
for 3d printing again

275
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,959
and laser cutting a lot of a lot of us

276
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:09,519
use laser cutting a lot to

277
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:10,560
to play around with ideas so that was

278
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:13,279
the explicit goal

279
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:15,518
these days it's most 3d printing and we

280
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:18,080
wanted the science to be human readable

281
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:19,680
we wanted the science to be uh easily

282
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:22,800
version controllable

283
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:26,000
and we wanted it to be natural and easy

284
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:28,000
to open source your designs

285
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,360
because not only the code has to be open

286
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,399
source i mean we can open source designs

287
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,240
too and

288
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:34,880
we try to battle the idea of sharing stl

289
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:37,200
files right

290
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:38,720
so and it's kind of so openness can

291
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,760
discover good at certain things because

292
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,279
of this right openness gets

293
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:44,560
good today for creating functional

294
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:46,480
objects but also since objects are code

295
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,920
and tends to be structured like software

296
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,120
a lot of good stuff falls out of that

297
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:52,240
right things like

298
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:55,680
uh abstractions libraries sharing reuse

299
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,480
et cetera and local healthcare is also

300
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,880
somehow

301
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,000
good at very complex math yourself and

302
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,040
there's a bunch of people out there that

303
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,399
do crazy crazy stuff

304
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,640
with openscad that they'll never

305
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:06,480
imagined but they somehow do it because

306
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,360
it's very hard in other tools to do kind

307
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,839
of

308
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,920
uh more kind of iterative recursive math

309
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:13,680
stuff

310
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,199
uh but on the flip side openness because

311
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,319
it's not so good that and a bunch of

312
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,320
other things like you can't

313
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,079
be rep style the designs if you want to

314
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,600
add chamfers and phillips to your

315
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:22,800
designs you're kind of better off using

316
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,079
other tools because it's going to be a

317
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,519
bit kind of

318
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:28,000
hard to get that to work properly and

319
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:29,200
open escape

320
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,120
and if you have to do kind of organic

321
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,880
shapes you kind of on your own right

322
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,160
so but if you've been in this debt room

323
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,399
for for a while you

324
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,519
you heard about free cad and category

325
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:38,959
and those are both really excellent

326
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:40,000
tools that's going to be can be great

327
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:41,359
companion tools to

328
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,600
to open scad if you want to go in that

329
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:46,000
direction and and you don't really have

330
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:48,480
to choose i mean a lot of people

331
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,839
use openscad in conjunction with classic

332
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,800
design tools

333
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:54,959
uh and typically you would use openscad

334
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:57,120
to create like quick functional sketches

335
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:59,199
and then you kind of start using like a

336
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,360
different kind of b-rep style tool for

337
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,720
creating your final design and for

338
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,160
instance freecad they

339
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,800
actually have an open sql workbench

340
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,959
where you can basically import your

341
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:09,199
organizations

342
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:14,640
and then slowly kind of make it into

343
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:17,440
proper b-rep designs

344
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:20,319
four minutes left so um so with

345
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,320
functional objects so

346
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,760
this is not actually open scale code but

347
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,800
it's kind of ninety percent of nesca

348
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,399
codes it's kind of an

349
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,560
idea of kind of thinking about how we

350
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:29,360
are moving on the language side of

351
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,719
things

352
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,000
so i often hear this complaint that

353
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,279
openness kind of claims to be a

354
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,399
functional programming language but it's

355
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:35,680
not really functional

356
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:37,839
it doesn't have all the features blah

357
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:39,680
blah blah and the idea here is that

358
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:41,680
openscad doesn't actually claim to be

359
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,959
belong to any particular class of

360
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,319
languages

361
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:47,119
but we do take a lot of ideas from

362
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,640
different places and we have been

363
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,560
quite pragmatic in terms of what

364
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:52,560
features we include into the language

365
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:55,199
mostly to figure out how do we enable

366
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:58,079
people to express kind of their designs

367
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:59,680
um but also i mean to be fair to that

368
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:01,199
criticism openness get

369
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,479
can be a little bit quirky at times it

370
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,800
has some kind of paradigms that doesn't

371
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:07,440
really fit into people's minds very well

372
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:08,719
uh and the project kind of did escape

373
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,399
into the world kind of

374
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,240
at a very young age and it got really

375
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:14,079
popular really fast

376
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,600
and we didn't really want to disrupt

377
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:17,680
that movement kind of while it was

378
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,680
already happening

379
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:21,680
but since then we have been slowly

380
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,719
moving kind of nudging things away to

381
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:25,920
try to kind of

382
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:28,639
make things more kind of traditional on

383
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:30,079
in the back end side right so

384
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:32,079
and a lot of the power users they really

385
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:33,599
want to use kind of more powerful

386
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:37,120
software features to create more

387
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:38,720
more fancy designs and uh

388
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,920
so we for instance we already have we

389
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,440
always have pure functions you can

390
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:43,839
define your own pure functions it's just

391
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:45,279
that the functions were not really

392
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:47,519
they were really limited you didn't have

393
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:48,959
good composibility functions and modules

394
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:49,839
to live in different name spaces you

395
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:52,880
couldn't have functions

396
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:53,680
values things like that we do actually

397
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,439
have now in

398
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:57,040
the nightly build we have functions as

399
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,480
values so

400
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,079
you can create anal numbers functions

401
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,440
you can pass function as parameters we

402
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:02,800
have closures

403
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,079
so that kind of really kind of helps a

404
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:07,040
little bit kind of moving things in the

405
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:08,800
direction of a functional language

406
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:10,880
and and that's something we really want

407
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:13,359
to focus on and as a next step

408
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:15,439
would typically be to have modules which

409
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,880
are basically shape generators as values

410
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,279
and maybe even objects as values but

411
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,880
that's

412
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:20,480
really kind of then starting to kind of

413
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,360
push the limits of the geometry engine

414
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,800
what we can

415
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:26,480
meaningfully do and

416
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,160
but the key challenges here is that it's

417
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:31,279
it's it's really hard to

418
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:32,719
design a language while it's being used

419
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:34,160
because backwards compatibility is

420
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,440
something people really expect when it

421
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,880
comes to design tools

422
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:39,120
if you have a 10 year old open sky

423
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,399
design it will work today and if you

424
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,600
wanted to stay that way and

425
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:45,199
break as little as possible and also

426
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:47,600
syntactic complexity

427
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:48,399
is something that is very hard for some

428
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,240
people

429
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:52,160
because a lot of openscad users are not

430
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:54,320
actually professional programmers

431
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,439
adding a very complex syntax to express

432
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,720
simple things it's not something you

433
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,480
want to do you don't keep this kind of

434
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,680
zero boilerplates kind of you you type

435
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,839
in stuff and you get it

436
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:03,519
as a high level thing and and if you

437
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:08,320
want to build something more complex

438
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:08,320
we want to make that possible right

439
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:13,120
we don't have a lot of time for the last

440
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:16,079
few slides but

441
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,639
we have some ideas what to do next in

442
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:18,399
addition to

443
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:19,839
the language stuff can we do a lot of

444
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:21,920
work on documentation

445
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:23,680
we want to do more on that uh as i

446
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,240
mentioned we were part of google system

447
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,319
docs

448
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,920
that helped us getting a really great

449
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,920
tutorial

450
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:31,599
we want to work on on geometry engine

451
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,160
and performance we just don't have a lot

452
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,120
of

453
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:36,399
resources and if anyone has any ideas

454
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,920
about kind of how to deal with

455
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:38,320
sustainability and funding of such a

456
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,240
project

457
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,839
i would have to talk about it we don't

458
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,160
have any funding practically right now

459
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:45,600
and

460
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:47,600
everyone has their jobs um

461
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,800
and also how do we move into the new

462
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,959
kind of

463
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,000
the new uh platforms out there kind of

464
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:53,359
these days kind of

465
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,120
people want to run this on the raspberry

466
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,720
pi's and they want to run it on android

467
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:59,839
and they want to run it on chromebooks

468
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:01,279
and it's complicated

469
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:03,600
ideas there will also be really really

470
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:03,600
welcome

471
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,639
but the core values that have kept us

472
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:11,680
alive so far is basically stability

473
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:12,160
we address crash bugs really really fast

474
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,279
uh

475
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:15,040
make it compatible backwards

476
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,519
compatibility and make it harder

477
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,959
friendly

478
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:18,880
allow people to run this thing on 10

479
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:20,160
year old computers don't require the

480
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:22,880
latest gpu

481
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:24,079
and it won't work because our audience

482
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:26,079
really wants

483
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:28,719
don't really kind of use are not gamers

484
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:30,638
basically right

485
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,839
you can help you don't have the right

486
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:33,600
code to help there's a lot of ways to

487
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:36,240
help without writing code

488
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,279
uh writing code kind of causes us to

489
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,199
have to do all these things

490
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:41,199
so if if you have anything you want to

491
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:43,839
do kind of

492
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:43,839
get in touch

493
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:56,240
and that's it thanks for listening

494
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,680
so before i take questions uh we are

495
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,680
trying to organize a really small kind

496
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,638
of birds of weather session tomorrow uh

497
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:04,319
if you're interested

498
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:07,759
uh just check kind of twitter check irc

499
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:08,959
and check the the foster website and

500
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:11,680
it will be available once you get the

501
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:11,680
room tomorrow morning

502
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:19,920
i'm i've used that openstack quite a bit

503
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:22,560
and you mentioned some of these

504
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:24,240
things i would like 2d and 3d parts and

505
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:26,880
extruding long path

506
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,839
lofts and fill it in chamfer and

507
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:30,240
everything else

508
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:32,800
is fine is there any scope for these

509
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:35,279
things on the horizon or is it ways off

510
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:36,719
that's a long list the question question

511
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:40,079
first

512
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:40,079
the question was uh

513
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,440
um so basically kind of how can we do

514
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:50,160
kind of through the entry parts uh

515
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,480
how can we do lofts fillets and chamfers

516
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,560
as

517
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,519
i did mention it's since we don't really

518
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:56,479
have it

519
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:58,720
it's not like an iterative design

520
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:01,519
process it's very hard to select

521
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,800
edges and then apply chamfers to them uh

522
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:04,000
quad query has an interesting way of

523
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,918
doing it where you actually do

524
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,199
you have selection operators we don't

525
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:09,199
have that because we are

526
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:10,319
describing things bottom-up we don't

527
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:13,120
really have any good

528
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:13,678
ideas for how to do it uh in terms of

529
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:16,719
lofting

530
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:21,120
and and extrusions it's easier

531
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:22,400
and we are working in that direction

532
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:24,559
the challenge is that we need to be able

533
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:26,720
to express uh objects

534
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:28,480
as values you can pass objects or at

535
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,280
least object generators as parameters to

536
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,799
functions like

537
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:32,480
the one thing i had on the screen

538
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:35,440
earlier here was

539
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:37,039
an example of how you can you can create

540
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,559
a 2d object generator you can pass that

541
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:40,320
into a function and you can pass it

542
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:42,559
a function into a function and then you

543
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:44,240
can sweep along that path

544
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:45,678
that's something that is semi possible

545
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,720
in user space today but it's a little

546
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:48,559
bit quirky

547
00:17:46,720 --> 00:18:01,840
and we hope to get it kind of on the on

548
00:17:48,559 --> 00:18:01,840
the radar really soon

549
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:15,280
yeah so the question is yeah

550
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:16,320
implicit cad you can get away uh you can

551
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:18,480
get around some of these

552
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,918
these the challenges because it has a

553
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:22,960
normal language around it

554
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:24,960
and are we planning to embed and a

555
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:27,360
regular language into openscad

556
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:29,280
and uh yeah you can in there actually a

557
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,799
bunch of projects kind of that

558
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:33,280
leaving that kind of ecosystem around

559
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:35,039
open escape and place the cat is is one

560
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:38,480
of them that does this really well

561
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:39,919
and uh i think we kind of went on this

562
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,880
road and i think we want to stay down

563
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:43,520
this road

564
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:44,400
and uh but i'm i'm really happy to see

565
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,840
other

566
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,919
other attempts at doing something

567
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:50,000
similar where it's possible to

568
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:51,039
at least share ideas and maybe share

569
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,799
community

570
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:54,320
and and maybe down the road find ways to

571
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,918
sharing code right

572
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:57,600
so but i think i would i would i would

573
00:18:55,919 --> 00:19:00,320
let implicit kind of

574
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:01,280
experience experiment with with going

575
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,480
down that path

576
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,360
and at some point you might expect to

577
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,559
see the point where actually it's

578
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,080
possible to kind of

579
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:08,000
merge some of this project into a bigger

580
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:09,199
piece that

581
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,799
so we don't have to invent everything

582
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:18,720
ourselves okay

583
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:18,720
hi jury uh maybe one more question

584
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:25,760
but what's a good way to have like a web

585
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:29,039
interface

586
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:31,200
to um do the parameterization of

587
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:33,039
stuff like because i think like like

588
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,720
often one designs things it would be

589
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:37,039
nice for people to

590
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:38,640
have it even easier to use it so like a

591
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:40,960
website

592
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:42,799
and then like uh auto generated sda

593
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:44,160
thing according to the parameters would

594
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:46,240
be nice is there a

595
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,679
smart way to do that yeah is there a

596
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:50,080
smart christmas is there a smart way to

597
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:52,160
have a web interface to basically do the

598
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:53,439
the parameterization as an end user one

599
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,400
after you have created the parametric

600
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,080
design and

601
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,440
i mean there are two things you can do

602
00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:00,799
and one thing is that

603
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:01,840
uh in openscad we now have uh what we

604
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:03,679
call a customizer

605
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,879
which is not a web interface but it's an

606
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:05,600
interface where you can hide the text

607
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,679
editor

608
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:09,199
and replace it with an auto-generated ui

609
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:10,080
so people can just click drag and drop

610
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,919
the different

611
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:14,000
free parameters that you have defined

612
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:17,039
and then get an object out of it

613
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,919
i mean thingiverse has a web interface

614
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:19,440
for this

615
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:21,760
it's just not really well maintained

616
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,960
right now uh and it's also not open

617
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24,879
source so it's kind of your

618
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:26,080
how to use thingiverse um but if you do

619
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,440
upload it and open the sky design

620
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:29,439
through thingiverse it will

621
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,200
auto generate a website for doing these

622
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,559
things and uh

623
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,559
i personally don't want to spend a lot

624
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:36,080
of time building websites

625
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:37,440
but everything is open source i mean if

626
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,879
anyone wants to actually spend a little

627
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,320
bit of time on it and host a website i

628
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,760
mean i'm more than happy to kind of

629
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:49,840
collaborate with that

630
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:49,840
okay thank you

631
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,840
you
