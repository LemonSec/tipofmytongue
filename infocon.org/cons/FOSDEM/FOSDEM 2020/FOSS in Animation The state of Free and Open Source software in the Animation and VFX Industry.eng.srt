1
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:08,559
hello fosdem

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:09,120
uh i'm going to introduce you to uh to

3
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:12,000
talk to you

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:14,320
to you about uh free and open source

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,600
software in animation industry

6
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,960
things evolved pretty quickly uh since a

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,279
few years so

8
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,000
when christoph proposed me to uh to make

9
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:23,840
her talk

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,599
at the at the open media room i thought

11
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,240
that it would be a good idea

12
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:30,160
to uh to speak about how things are

13
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:32,399
evolving in the animation industry

14
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,840
so before going further i'm going to

15
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:37,040
introduce myself

16
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,399
i'm frank russo i'm first entrepreneur i

17
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:41,440
did the first company

18
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:44,399
which was doing a

19
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:46,640
open source open source personal clouds

20
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:50,000
after that i created a new company

21
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:53,680
which is a cg wire a very big company

22
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,719
of of three people including me and uh

23
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:58,719
and we at cgyr we work for the animation

24
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:59,520
industry we do a production tracking

25
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:01,840
software but

26
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,600
everything in uh as an open source as

27
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,600
free and open source software

28
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,360
outside of that i did some side projects

29
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:11,039
contributed to some others

30
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:13,920
and i worked since now 15 years

31
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,320
so i have i had the opportunity to see

32
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,840
many

33
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:17,758
many things and many uh software

34
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,000
projects

35
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:22,240
now let's go to the to the animation

36
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,240
before before talking about the software

37
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:27,199
that's that are used now

38
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,479
i'm going to explain you very quickly uh

39
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,960
how to make a

40
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:32,240
an animation production so here i'm

41
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,798
going to talk many about

42
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,679
3d because uh when it's about 2d

43
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,759
animation

44
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,680
everything is proprietary so it's not so

45
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:42,240
interesting for this talk

46
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,880
so so there is three big steps to make a

47
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,640
movie

48
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:46,000
there is a pre-production mainly it's

49
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,200
about uh

50
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,960
writing the story and look for funding

51
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,479
there is the production step which is

52
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:55,679
the one we will interest

53
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:58,560
us is the production step i will go back

54
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,920
very soon to it and and there is the

55
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,560
post production uh

56
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,799
step where there is uh where is mostly

57
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,960
fine tuning and refining of the movies

58
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:08,640
so in the production step uh we have

59
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,959
many uh we have many

60
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:12,238
departments many things to do the first

61
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:14,920
thing is the layout

62
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:17,280
it's when uh it's like the the

63
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:20,079
pre-directing of the movies

64
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,720
what is the directing of the movie we

65
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,040
create

66
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:25,680
shots and we put everything in place but

67
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:28,959
we only allow polygons

68
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:32,480
assets and and just to to make sure that

69
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:34,160
every shots are good in a

70
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:36,160
directing point of view and that they

71
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,920
match properly the storyboard there is

72
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:41,440
some rng to make sure that

73
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:44,319
the artistic direction is uh is doable

74
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,519
and that that some effects are are

75
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:48,958
possible

76
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:51,120
then then start the the real creation of

77
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:53,280
the movies as a

78
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,680
there is a modeling phase it's a it's

79
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:58,000
about sculpting the 3d elements

80
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,519
after that there is texturing every

81
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,599
elements are painted

82
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:05,360
and some and some settings are done to

83
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:06,799
to manage the reflection of the light on

84
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,440
the elements

85
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:11,920
then there is a rigging step which means

86
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:14,959
that we add bonds to every uh

87
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:17,679
to every uh assets that are

88
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,000
going to be animated then we go to the

89
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,280
then

90
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,360
we we do the animations mainly it's uh

91
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:26,799
it's about taking the elements of the

92
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:29,280
layout including the high poly uh

93
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:29,920
high polygon stuff to uh and animate

94
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,400
them to

95
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,238
to make sure that that at the end we

96
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,799
have a nice a nice shot

97
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:37,519
this is the most time consuming uh part

98
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:41,200
of the

99
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:44,239
of the movie then we had some vfx

100
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:46,000
some lighting for for to make things a

101
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:48,080
little bit more artistic

102
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,040
and finally we finish with the rendering

103
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,680
which can be

104
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,560
very long because uh one frame can take

105
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,080
hours of

106
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,920
days to render and for a feature film

107
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:01,120
for instance so you have

108
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:04,879
approximately you have an average of 130

109
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,680
000 frames so all of that requires a lot

110
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:07,840
of different

111
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:10,080
a lot of different skill sets different

112
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,560
people with different expertise and many

113
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,560
softwares

114
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:18,478
oops and so

115
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:21,040
and what we have to understand is that

116
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:24,560
the animation industry has really a

117
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:27,759
proprietary mindset for them a

118
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,880
picture must not leak pictures belong to

119
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:32,479
the producer

120
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:34,320
it's like uh we don't we don't share uh

121
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:35,758
there is this notion of not really

122
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:38,800
sharing the eyepieces

123
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:39,759
there is a strong notion of ip so it's

124
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,080
uh

125
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:42,800
when when it's about software we can uh

126
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,280
we can see

127
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,440
that it's something similar most of the

128
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,758
big software are proprietary they come

129
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,800
from

130
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:53,280
autodesk the foundry adobe

131
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,240
orton boom and there is a challenger

132
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,719
which is a

133
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,919
side fx they do really interesting

134
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:01,520
software but

135
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:03,919
only proprietary definitely

136
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:05,840
but it is awesome but reality is not who

137
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:07,198
doesn't really fit with the proprietary

138
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,198
mindsets

139
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:10,320
what is happening is that like in every

140
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:12,800
industry

141
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,639
they need to reduce costs uh they need

142
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,520
more for more automations

143
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:19,199
and uh and there is a lack of developers

144
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,840
now every developers work for

145
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,479
startups gaffer and everything like that

146
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:26,320
so

147
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:29,039
there is no not so much uh people who

148
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,440
to do software in the animation industry

149
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:31,680
and

150
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,120
before that this they thought that they

151
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,360
could make a

152
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,639
difference by with their technology that

153
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,639
the studio could

154
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:40,320
could be more competitive because of its

155
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:42,800
of its technology

156
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,440
but now they are figuring out that it's

157
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,160
mostly

158
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,800
the artistic specificities that that

159
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,199
will uh

160
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,360
that help them to stand out from the

161
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:54,400
others

162
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,400
uh no

163
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,880
okay

164
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,759
sorry

165
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:06,960
[Music]

166
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:08,080
so they decided to go open source for

167
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:11,198
that

168
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:14,560
many the big players decided to uh

169
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:16,400
to work on on more interoperability

170
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,199
between software they decided to stick

171
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,840
to uh

172
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:21,520
to proprietary digital creation content

173
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:24,719
tools

174
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:27,400
and and for that

175
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,960
but they decided to work on more

176
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:32,799
standardizations of

177
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:35,840
file exchange because mainly

178
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,759
when you do a production before before a

179
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:40,239
few years ago when you did a production

180
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:42,400
you could use only one software now you

181
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,600
you have many software involved you have

182
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,560
a maya

183
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,919
software like maya like substance mari

184
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,319
marie

185
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:51,120
zbrush many you have to use many tools

186
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:54,080
to uh

187
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:56,160
to make very beautiful pictures but it's

188
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:59,039
a it's a choice but you can

189
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,000
now really big productions use many many

190
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:01,919
tools

191
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,800
and so they need some some

192
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:07,758
standardizations and for that they

193
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,240
they created uh several five formats and

194
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:10,880
uh

195
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,360
associated uh libraries to manage them

196
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,599
so

197
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,880
like there are formats like uh along

198
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:18,159
with abc which is

199
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:19,120
one of the most used i think where here

200
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,520
it's used to

201
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,960
to store the the coordinates of the

202
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,919
animation so

203
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,479
it's a first step towards more

204
00:07:24,919 --> 00:07:29,758
interoperability

205
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:31,758
there is a usd this is probably the most

206
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:32,319
exciting format because it's uh it's

207
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:35,680
really

208
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:37,919
aimed at uh enabling collaborative work

209
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,919
and there is some kind of layering

210
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:42,799
layering in here

211
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:44,960
with every change and so it really helps

212
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:47,520
to work

213
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,878
from different uh tools and for with

214
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,318
different people on it

215
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:52,240
and there are some others this is a

216
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:55,680
non-exhaustive list to utilize

217
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,160
others but that there is other formats

218
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,759
that

219
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,840
happens on different parts of the

220
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:02,560
production that are used in different

221
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:05,758
parts of the production

222
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:08,879
and there is another thing another uh

223
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:11,599
interesting uh interesting uh

224
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:13,360
story it's a story of open queue it's a

225
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:17,199
wonderful manager that was

226
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:20,879
done that was built at uh sony uh sony

227
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:23,120
something and uh it was kind of acquired

228
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:24,720
by google i think the main developer was

229
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,759
hired by google but it's

230
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,319
it's something like this and it was it's

231
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:30,479
uh

232
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:32,159
and yeah but sony decided to open source

233
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:33,199
it it was the first time that the full

234
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:36,159
software was

235
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,599
was open sourced by uh by a big company

236
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:40,399
like this

237
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:41,519
and yet so it's interesting and then it

238
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:44,519
became uh

239
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:45,680
used by uh now it's now maintained by a

240
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:48,640
aswf

241
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,279
academy software foundation uh

242
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:52,480
definitely

243
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:54,720
so academic software for nation

244
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,720
which

245
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:02,079
the meeting sorry i forgot uh i don't

246
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:05,040
find the right word but this is uh

247
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,920
the meeting of several big companies uh

248
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:09,279
gaffa

249
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:11,760
big studios like weta ilm from now

250
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:15,120
disney

251
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:18,240
and for big big companies and some

252
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:20,480
and with some free software actors like

253
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:23,040
blenders or links relations

254
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,839
and their goal here is to maintain many

255
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:27,040
maintain

256
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:32,480
this all the library used to

257
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:32,480
use for the this uh these file formats

258
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:38,239
yeah another interesting thing is epic

259
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:41,439
games

260
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:43,760
they do uh unreal engine which is not

261
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,720
really used in animation for animations

262
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:48,880
it's only uh

263
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:51,920
used for some uv so from cinematic uh

264
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:53,279
for video games cinematics but what they

265
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:55,839
do is

266
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:57,040
is that they give money to some of open

267
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:59,200
source projects which

268
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,079
can be uh which is still interesting

269
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,079
because it

270
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:04,079
it brings some fuel to uh to improve

271
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:07,199
some software

272
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:09,040
so everything we talked about uh was

273
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,399
really interesting but it's more about

274
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:14,079
big corporations

275
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:17,440
and that's not so that's not really what

276
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:18,640
what we like it's now let's talk more

277
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:21,279
about free software

278
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:22,319
free software is where free software is

279
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:24,240
sometimes ugly

280
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,560
but it's much more exciting and much

281
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,200
much more fun so i propose now that we

282
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:30,239
focus

283
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:31,680
more on this and talk less about the big

284
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,680
ones

285
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,800
so the first thing to understand that uh

286
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:38,399
in animation

287
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:42,959
python is king the the

288
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:45,600
before that uh many uh all the software

289
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:46,959
had their own scripting language which

290
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:50,000
which are mostly

291
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:53,279
badly designed and not well documented

292
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,279
so quickly people are cg artists tended

293
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:59,439
to use a python instead of the

294
00:10:55,279 --> 00:11:02,640
of the proprietary scripting language

295
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:04,399
languages and and now python

296
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:06,160
is uh the default language for

297
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:07,279
everything every time someone wants to

298
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:10,000
do a

299
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:10,800
script use spice python which is

300
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,200
interesting

301
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,000
because uh it's not c sharp it's not

302
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,320
java it's really

303
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,120
python which is to me it's a it's really

304
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:20,480
a more

305
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:22,160
uh community a driven long yes

306
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:25,360
it's more community driven language so

307
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,360
it's it's interesting

308
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:30,720
and other tools that are widely used uh

309
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,360
i think the one of the first tools which

310
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,920
were

311
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:36,000
widely used is ffmpeg so it's

312
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:39,040
interesting because a few

313
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,040
few years ago it was like uh wow

314
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,480
it's open source so we don't want to use

315
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,800
it and now it

316
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,320
it's like the default uh default

317
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:49,040
software to

318
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:50,639
to process videos to to meld them and

319
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:54,079
etc

320
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:55,600
there is a res uh it's i don't know if

321
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:58,000
you know this but it's uh

322
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:00,800
it looks it looks widely used outside of

323
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:04,399
animation too it's a packaging system to

324
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:05,199
deploy easily uh tools on on desktop

325
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:06,639
machine on

326
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,399
yeah on the stock machine so when you

327
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:10,560
have especially on windows

328
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:11,839
when you have a lot of of machines you

329
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:16,399
can use res

330
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:20,320
to package a complex deployment

331
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:22,480
and there are some image processing uh

332
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:24,160
image processing libraries that are used

333
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:27,200
another thing interesting is

334
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:29,120
interesting is that the there is a

335
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:31,279
strong culture of self-hosting

336
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:33,200
uh they because they don't want that

337
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:35,360
picture leak and because

338
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:38,000
they always have an overloaded network

339
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:40,079
because all files are really big and

340
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,440
and the network and they need to watch a

341
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:45,120
lot of

342
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:48,160
video on youtube for their for their

343
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:50,480
as references so uh so they

344
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,600
they like to have everything uh still

345
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,440
locally because

346
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,600
they can have better performance and

347
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,839
they have a sense of security

348
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,440
the result is that they they deploy a

349
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:03,600
lot of

350
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:05,839
of software themselves and so they use

351
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,200
sysops tooling and communication tools

352
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:11,440
like materials riot

353
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:13,360
xterra when they can they prefer to use

354
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,680
linux for their workstation because it's

355
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,839
much more plugable

356
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:20,638
there is this notion i forgot to mention

357
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:23,519
it but there is this notion of uh

358
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:24,160
of pipeline in animation which means

359
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:26,320
pipeline

360
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,600
basically is the the glue between every

361
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:31,360
department and every

362
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:34,160
every steps of fabrication

363
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:35,279
so let's go a little bit faster now

364
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,199
blender also

365
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:39,040
python is king so let's say that blender

366
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:41,600
is queen there is uh

367
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,160
since a few years and especially since

368
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,120
the

369
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:47,360
latest version arrives at 2.8 there's

370
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:51,519
really a lot of excitement

371
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:55,279
around around blender it's a

372
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:57,360
yeah it's a it really changes

373
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:59,839
i don't the the community is actually

374
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:03,279
very active of course but

375
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:05,199
they it it becomes it comes from the

376
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:07,360
the fact that there is a lack of cg

377
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:09,760
artists like there is a lack of

378
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,199
developers so prior to that people were

379
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:13,519
kind of scared that uh

380
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:14,639
to use blender because city artists were

381
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:17,680
not trained to

382
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:21,600
do this but now the question is more

383
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:23,519
uh how how do i find good cg artists so

384
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:26,639
when you find a good teacher artist

385
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:28,160
you find the the tooling is not

386
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:30,639
the priorities to find a good city

387
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,120
artist not to find the cg artists who

388
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:34,320
know

389
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:37,360
the tools of the studio so

390
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,240
this is one of the that was one of the

391
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:41,040
main

392
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:42,320
blocks to use blender so now it's not

393
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:44,480
anymore there

394
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,079
so the result is that blender was used

395
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:49,199
on many productions

396
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:50,880
it really made their user happy and now

397
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:54,319
we have full productions like

398
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:55,040
this one mushmash it will be broadcasted

399
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,920
in

400
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:59,920
next the next year i think but now we

401
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:01,599
have full productions done with blender

402
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:04,319
which is really a big change

403
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,440
and there is another big event is that i

404
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,079
lost my body

405
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:10,240
it's uh it's an animation movie we which

406
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:10,959
is nominated to oscar and which had a

407
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,959
price

408
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:14,239
at nc festival the equivalent the

409
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:17,040
equivalent of a

410
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,040
kian festival

411
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,880
and i lost my body was done with the

412
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:24,000
blender too so it's

413
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:26,000
i think it's really a big change for uh

414
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,120
in the industry that to see that now you

415
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,680
can do a full

416
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,639
full qualitative production with blender

417
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:33,758
plus they had

418
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:36,959
added many more features they had many

419
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:39,440
very cool features like real time

420
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:41,680
like a real-time viewport so it's really

421
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:44,560
faster to to make movies and to have to

422
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:46,959
have feedback on what you are doing

423
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:48,160
and there is this grease pencil thing

424
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:50,800
that allows you to

425
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:52,560
basically make 2d in size 2d animation

426
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:55,599
inside blender

427
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:57,518
which which is great for for many uh for

428
00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:01,519
many studios

429
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:04,240
about the other main tools there is a

430
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:05,120
there is game has still has a bad

431
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,600
reputation

432
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:09,519
because most people don't like the ui

433
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,480
it's a little bit sad but the result is

434
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:13,600
that it's not

435
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:17,440
used much on the productions there is

436
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:20,399
the case of netron uh it's uh netron

437
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,880
is not considered as goodness compared

438
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:23,600
to a

439
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:25,120
proprietary software but it's still the

440
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:28,399
only uh

441
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:30,079
first alternative the the the main issue

442
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:31,199
today is that the maintainers left i

443
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:33,040
didn't follow

444
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:35,519
what happened next but the maintainer

445
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:38,560
slept so there is a kind of

446
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:41,199
there is kind of all there and there is

447
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:42,638
and it's sad because uh people really

448
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:44,000
would like to see uh to have an

449
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:45,920
alternative to nuke

450
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,680
which is very expensive and doesn't work

451
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:50,639
that way

452
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:51,680
it's uh yeah i forgot to tell that next

453
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:54,399
one is many for

454
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:56,319
com compositing and so what what is

455
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:56,959
compositing is just adding some effects

456
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:00,720
on

457
00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:02,399
on the final video but not final for

458
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,319
case but when you have when you have

459
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:06,880
rendered all your pictures you add some

460
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:07,438
you can add some other effects and it's

461
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,400
done

462
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:12,000
at the compositing steps it's more most

463
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:14,799
of the time it's considered

464
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,919
the steps to fix some bugs in the in the

465
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:19,119
video

466
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:20,079
and what is a very interesting uh what

467
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:22,799
is

468
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:23,839
really more interesting i think is krita

469
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:27,199
krita

470
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:28,559
is not widely used today but it has a

471
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:31,360
really good

472
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:32,000
reputation uh every siege artist will

473
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:34,559
try it

474
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,240
love it and it could replace at some

475
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:38,639
point photoshops for

476
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,520
everything that is uh backgrounds

477
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,960
because yeah

478
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:44,080
in uh in animation movies uh most of the

479
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:47,360
time and even

480
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:50,320
in big vfx movies the backgrounds are

481
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:51,439
2d pictures that are done by with

482
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:55,200
photoshop

483
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:56,640
or similar here are some pictures made

484
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,640
with krita

485
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:00,320
that i took from the gallery criter

486
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:02,320
gallery so you can see that there

487
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:05,280
you can do a pretty you can do

488
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:08,960
everything you want with it uh

489
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:12,320
when it's about 2d to the

490
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:14,160
2d pictures now there is another

491
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:15,280
phenomena which is very interesting too

492
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:18,320
is that

493
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:21,360
we have small to mid-size studios who

494
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:25,200
are now open sourcing uh some of their

495
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:27,439
software uh it's not

496
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,240
they are not big software but it just

497
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:31,360
means that

498
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:32,240
the the mindset is changing and it

499
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,559
creates

500
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:36,960
excitement in the community of

501
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:39,678
developers in animation which is a

502
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:40,960
which is good and which will probably

503
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:43,840
lead to more

504
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:44,640
interesting software in the future there

505
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:47,360
is another

506
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:48,160
good case is left special it's a studio

507
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:51,600
which use

508
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:54,240
only only free software so

509
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:55,520
in the open source everything there is a

510
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:59,919
white

511
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:59,918
which is very nice to see

512
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:08,000
and and there is a my company cgyr

513
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,799
what is makes it a little bit special is

514
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,280
that it's

515
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:13,520
that we do we are the first company in

516
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:16,639
the animation field to propose

517
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:18,080
uh free software uh which is uh we

518
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:20,240
basically propose a project

519
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:21,760
project management tool named production

520
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:24,880
tracker

521
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:27,440
and yes and what makes

522
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,799
it really great is that for us it was

523
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:31,760
the opportunity to create

524
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:32,559
more collaborations between studios so

525
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:35,039
for that we

526
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:35,760
organize uh some meetups where people

527
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:38,160
can share

528
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:42,400
best practice on the same model as has

529
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:45,120
here it didn't exist really for the

530
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:46,000
for the for the animation so we we

531
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:49,760
organized them

532
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,160
and and we we created some online chat

533
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:53,600
group

534
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:57,280
and i published content on uh

535
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:59,439
on our blog so that's important because

536
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:01,678
the fact to publish an open source

537
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:03,600
software allows us really to create more

538
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:07,200
collaboration between studios

539
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:09,520
and yes i think that a first project is

540
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:12,400
not only code and this is uh

541
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:13,918
and it can really benefit a side of the

542
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:16,159
future it can really benefit

543
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:18,880
to the world industry towards the

544
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:21,679
mindset it brings

545
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:23,039
to conclude uh things were pretty bad a

546
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:25,520
few years ago now they are getting

547
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:28,000
better we have more and more software

548
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:29,039
uh more and more first software that are

549
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,960
used uh

550
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:36,000
we have a big big big players are many

551
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:38,720
interested in interoperability

552
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,159
small and mid-studio mid-size studio are

553
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:43,440
going further and try to

554
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:43,919
use open source everywhere free software

555
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,559
brings

556
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:48,000
more collaborations and blender is life

557
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:49,280
is good and it's beautiful and we are

558
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,679
happy to see

559
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:53,039
that it's successful today after such a

560
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:56,159
long time

561
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:58,799
thank you for attention and if you have

562
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:58,799
any questions

563
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:06,080
please

564
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:07,039
and we have a question do you think that

565
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:09,039
someday

566
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:10,080
we will have an alternative to nuke if

567
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:13,600
open source

568
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:17,600
in open source if nature disappears

569
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:21,120
uh uh school um

570
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:24,559
i i i'm not sure it's related to uh to

571
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:26,399
to the to nature what

572
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:28,158
what surprised me is that no one tried

573
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:31,039
to do it uh it's really a

574
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:34,159
it would really be a good idea to uh to

575
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:37,120
to to make an alternative to nuke

576
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:38,080
starting from neutrons sounds to me more

577
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:40,320
like natural

578
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:41,600
so i i'm i'm not sure it's a good idea

579
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:45,840
to kill neutron

580
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:45,840
to have to have an alternative

581
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,120
next question what is in your opinion

582
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:51,120
the largest

583
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:53,280
slash most important component in these

584
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:54,639
workflows that is mainly supported by

585
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,559
open source communities

586
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:59,039
as opposed to the tools coming from or

587
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:59,039
funded by

588
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:12,479
i don't i don't really get the question

589
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:14,640
but uh

590
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,640
you know

591
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:20,480
i think the the the the most is it's in

592
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:23,120
this list are okay

593
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:24,159
the the biggest the largest component

594
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:26,239
today that is

595
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:27,760
emerging is really blender because you

596
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:30,320
can use it on every step of the

597
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:33,600
production so

598
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:34,960
it it you can say you can imagine to now

599
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:37,280
to have a

600
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:38,799
pipeline for production pipeline based

601
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:41,918
on your own blender

602
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:44,559
which is quite audacious but

603
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:45,520
but it's possible so the factor it makes

604
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:47,760
it uh

605
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:49,440
probably the the main component of a

606
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:52,080
pipeline

607
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:53,039
it's hard to compare with python because

608
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,199
python is every

609
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:56,240
is everywhere so of course it's the

610
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:59,120
biggest but

611
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:01,200
it's it's more like a low level thing

612
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:04,959
when a blender is really

613
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:06,840
the central software of

614
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:08,320
could be the central software of a

615
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:11,439
production what

616
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:14,240
what we see too is that uh blender is

617
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:16,159
more appreciated by uh some modelers or

618
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:18,559
some animators so sometimes

619
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:20,960
they they do their work in blender and

620
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:24,000
then they import it in maya to uh

621
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:26,000
to allow to to

622
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,360
to be uh compatible with the rest of the

623
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,960
production but

624
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:33,280
it's it's yeah it's really uh it can be

625
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,280
really

626
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:39,120
adapted to any situation so yeah i would

627
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:41,200
say that it's blender

628
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:42,479
last question what is the scenario for

629
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,559
video editing

630
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:46,360
that i checked and why i was having

631
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:50,000
instability issues

632
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:53,199
i don't know well video editing

633
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:55,039
uh no i don't know

634
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:57,520
i don't know really well the software

635
00:23:55,039 --> 00:24:00,640
i'm mostly focused on

636
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:04,799
on uh on 3d and 2d

637
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:07,200
creations but because editing is

638
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:08,639
it's uh yeah it's it's another almost

639
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,480
another subject

640
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:12,159
when they uh when in animation

641
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,760
production when they have the storyboard

642
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:18,159
they really have to stick to it

643
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:21,840
uh sometimes they can work with a

644
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:23,919
dedicated uh video editor but i'm not

645
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:25,520
used enough to do this problematic to

646
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:29,440
talk about it

647
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:29,440
one question

648
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:34,960
no yes so what about blender

649
00:24:33,559 --> 00:24:38,158
certification

650
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:39,039
i know this is the the only way you can

651
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:42,720
take the better

652
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:44,720
certification around the data institute

653
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,559
and what is your take on that and how

654
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:49,760
can we change that

655
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:54,879
i i'm not really oh yeah okay

656
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:54,879
what about the blender certification uh

657
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:59,279
i'm not i don't really know about

658
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:02,639
education

659
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:05,760
what uh what i can tell is that uh now

660
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:08,159
this is what i told before uh

661
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:09,919
studios understand that they have to uh

662
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:13,919
to train people to blend their

663
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:16,240
so studios who decide which decide to uh

664
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:17,360
to go to to go with blender know that

665
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:20,559
they will have to

666
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:23,520
train people that come to uh that

667
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:25,279
that come to their to their studio uh of

668
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,679
course certification are interesting

669
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:28,159
because

670
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:28,799
for some others it's always it's always

671
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:31,440
easier to

672
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:32,960
if you have someone who is already

673
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:35,919
trained to blender

674
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:36,400
uh now there is another phenomena is

675
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:37,840
that

676
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,840
there are a lot of because there is a

677
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:41,760
lack of cgrtis there are

678
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:43,678
there is something like every month a

679
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:46,799
new cg school

680
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:48,640
that is popping so probably that

681
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:50,158
at some point they will include more

682
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:52,880
blender or training

683
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:55,200
but currently in yeah in education i

684
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:57,360
don't see much of blender

685
00:25:55,200 --> 00:26:00,159
that's why the certifications of blender

686
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:02,479
institute is properly interesting

687
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:03,760
for the moment because there is no not

688
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:07,039
much alternative

689
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:07,039
there is no much alternative to

690
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:11,840
this
