1
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,040
good morning all together

2
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:10,400
my name is thomas bremer i'm from

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:12,559
germany i'm a

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:14,400
software developer as free as i'm

5
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:17,039
working as a freelancer

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,480
mainly in the area of embedded systems

7
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:21,840
and

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:24,960
well geoscience or geospatial science is

9
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:27,680
kind of my hobby which

10
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,880
on the one hand gives me lots of fun

11
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:32,479
entertainment

12
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:35,760
hopefully useful results um

13
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:40,078
but i don't have have much time for it

14
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:43,360
um and with with this this thing i'm

15
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:47,039
going to present here i've hit well

16
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:50,960
some in in some

17
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:54,399
some big bubble which might explode

18
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,399
some at some time

19
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:01,038
so he's not the av guy yeah okay

20
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:04,959
you recognize them by just selling

21
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:04,960
t-shirts yeah okay i expected that

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:13,360
yeah this one yeah

23
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:17,759
or something like this so you added the

24
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:22,479
the camouflage yeah well

25
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:22,479
for the remainder i need the the slides

26
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:28,560
well the first slide i can start i can i

27
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:29,759
can try to start my presentation without

28
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,159
the slides because uh

29
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,799
the the first stuff i can simply tell

30
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,159
you

31
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:37,520
um i started with um was a presentation

32
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:40,560
or the idea of

33
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:42,640
thomas alva edison

34
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,000
who well rumor has it that he has

35
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,920
invented the light bulb

36
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,479
which isn't true he hasn't done it it

37
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:51,600
was a german called heinrich grubel

38
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:54,799
and edison made it

39
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:58,640
use or usable for the public this

40
00:01:54,799 --> 00:02:01,439
this light bulb and this the screw mount

41
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:03,280
which you know or which maybe the the

42
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:05,279
elder people of you know from

43
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:08,318
when when we had this incandescent light

44
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:13,360
bulbs uh to plug or to screw in

45
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:14,640
um they have different sizes e10 e14 e27

46
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,959
and this e

47
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,679
stands for edison so that's where his

48
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:20,000
name

49
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,680
has remained until today but he's also

50
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,800
famous for certain

51
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:27,520
quotes he made and one of this is genius

52
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:30,720
is one percent inspirations and 99

53
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:33,360
perspiration this

54
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,920
also well this also holds for me because

55
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,560
i'm

56
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,280
more on the one percent side uh i have

57
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,040
to say

58
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,840
and last year i've been here and there

59
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:44,879
was a talk about this webserver

60
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:47,840
three geonames.org

61
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:49,599
i have to to correct the slides and see

62
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:54,560
there are some typos on it

63
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:57,920
on them um this this web server

64
00:02:54,560 --> 00:03:00,480
had the feature that you

65
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:02,559
you give it some some geo coordinates

66
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:05,840
interactively by clicking or that

67
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:09,280
it also has had an api and you

68
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:12,879
get back a combination of three three

69
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:16,720
city names worldwide um which

70
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:19,200
represent this this location um

71
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:21,040
it's well it's not a kind of compression

72
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,560
compression but it's kind of a mental

73
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,959
compression because you

74
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,319
three three words with meaning or you

75
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:29,680
maybe know them

76
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:34,238
um have uh they're more easily

77
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:37,920
more easy to remember than two

78
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:37,920
two long decimal numbers

79
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:46,480
and here yeah i try

80
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:49,679
um yeah um

81
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:51,920
and he also had uh on this website or he

82
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:55,360
has on this website the feature that

83
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:57,679
you can encode the um the

84
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,879
these two geo names and these

85
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:02,640
two-dimensional

86
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:05,920
geocoordinates into a one-dimensional

87
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:09,518
so to say uh hash string

88
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:11,760
of 11 characters and

89
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:15,840
he uh the presenter also told about a

90
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:19,140
hilbert curve which was

91
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:22,240
hey you you're binding me um

92
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:24,159
[Music]

93
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,639
he also told about the hilbert curve we

94
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,720
he used for this

95
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:30,320
for this mapping for this conversation

96
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:34,400
uh to

97
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:35,360
uh to reduce the to reduce the borders

98
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:39,599
now

99
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:42,000
he's also taking me away the i'm sorry

100
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,240
no it's okay you just have to do your

101
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:57,040
work

102
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:59,520
i'm on you for fun

103
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,880
well i've already used it to watch tv

104
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:03,758
and

105
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,759
stuff like that

106
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:11,840
okay let's see

107
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:20,479
okay so uh what i did then after because

108
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:23,360
i found the

109
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:25,840
the idea rather interesting um was that

110
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:28,240
i analyzed the website and i had a

111
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:31,440
closer look at it so to say um

112
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:33,919
and i i saw that uh the mapping

113
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:36,080
really works in both direction you can

114
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:39,280
can enter geocoordinates and get the

115
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:41,280
the bird combination or back um

116
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:43,440
i already told you that there's an api

117
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:45,280
where you can which you can use

118
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,039
um there's a link to the source code

119
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:50,559
which is also

120
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:53,599
appreciatable in terms of open source

121
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,479
and there's also a map in the user

122
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:58,560
interface

123
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:59,120
but it's rather small it's improvable so

124
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,840
to say

125
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:04,160
and also the user interface around it is

126
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:07,039
also improvable

127
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:08,160
so i had a closer look at the code it

128
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:11,199
has been written in

129
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:15,039
in perl it's um

130
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:19,840
the code is working as expected

131
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:23,280
and but it's not not easily readable

132
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:26,400
then in the code there are some while

133
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:29,758
some obstacles so to say

134
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:31,120
or almost obstacles it's tweakable

135
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:34,240
because

136
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:36,720
some big integer representation is used

137
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,080
for arbitrary size integers which are

138
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:41,120
not needed

139
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:44,318
um there's a bit shuffling code in it

140
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:47,919
which is in the which is done

141
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:50,400
in the the most standard way which is

142
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:54,479
which is heavily tunable

143
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:57,599
um and also the

144
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:58,639
the hashes uh i told you about the this

145
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:02,240
f11

146
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:05,039
letter string is done of or it consists

147
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:07,520
of 26 characters

148
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:09,039
all alphabetic characters and the 10

149
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:11,359
digits

150
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:12,240
there are other representation which

151
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,599
only used

152
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:18,880
32 characters and digits per

153
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:22,560
letter to make it um well to

154
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:25,440
to avoid some some rude words which

155
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,800
which you might create with such a

156
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:30,560
mechanism

157
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:33,759
so um so to say

158
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,560
this this free geonames.org website

159
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:38,400
represents

160
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:41,840
um a very good idea um

161
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:44,878
it works but it's still

162
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:48,719
improvable in in terms of

163
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:52,960
ui and also coding style

164
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:55,599
um and i would say it's maybe

165
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:57,280
in the area of 50 percent if you if you

166
00:07:55,599 --> 00:08:00,878
use this hibits

167
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:02,799
this edison scale as i called it

168
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:04,000
but then like there was the idea of the

169
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:07,759
hilbert curve

170
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,319
um and this this now is was was the one

171
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:11,599
percent

172
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:13,919
inspiration for me uh because

173
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:15,280
when you look when you do some research

174
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:17,198
on it and you find out

175
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,960
you could do the following you could

176
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:20,960
just take one hilbert curve or

177
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:23,599
take several take take four of them

178
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:27,440
connect them to a cyclic moor curve

179
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:30,719
put them on um on the map you can use

180
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:34,320
the for the whole world you can use this

181
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:37,440
this level 0 osm tile

182
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:42,159
with the mercator

183
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:45,440
mapping with the mercato projection then

184
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:49,120
what you can do is that you can take

185
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:51,839
a point on this map map it to

186
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:53,200
the distance it has on this on this

187
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:57,040
curve

188
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:59,279
from fixed origin you have to define

189
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,240
and then if you have several points you

190
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:03,360
can

191
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:05,360
map all of them and you can sort them

192
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:08,880
according to this distance on the

193
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:11,839
on the curve and the result is that this

194
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:13,839
this order you you find is is an

195
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:14,399
approximation to the traveling salesman

196
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:18,240
problem

197
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:22,800
um it's it's a rather reasonable not

198
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,800
optimal but reasonable route you find

199
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,720
this has already been studied in the

200
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:28,720
past

201
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,880
there were you find examples where meals

202
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,800
on wheels have been using it and they

203
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:35,439
really improved their their driving

204
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:37,439
times with that you can also

205
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,800
can also use it again for packet

206
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:42,640
delivery for

207
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:44,800
geocaching or for home care

208
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:46,080
wherever you have to to visit many many

209
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,560
positions so

210
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,360
imagine that you have you use this this

211
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,839
system as an

212
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:53,360
addressing system for postal services

213
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:57,440
you simply have this

214
00:09:53,360 --> 00:10:00,720
um you give it this unique

215
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:01,920
uh address and the postman simply has to

216
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:05,440
to sort his

217
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:08,959
uh his letters according to the to this

218
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:13,600
index and travels them and um

219
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:13,599
well he can do it rather rather fast

220
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,399
so

221
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,360
regarding the perspiration as i said i'm

222
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:24,480
more on the this one percent

223
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:26,800
side um yeah

224
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,560
what i did or what i'm working on now is

225
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:32,959
another proof of concept

226
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:37,359
uh i would like to make it um a complete

227
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:41,040
complete a complete system

228
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:43,040
but as i said i'm i don't have the

229
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,360
perspiration on the one hand and since

230
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,399
it's

231
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:47,600
only a hobby i i can't find the time for

232
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:52,160
that

233
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:56,240
um and there's even more inspiration

234
00:10:52,160 --> 00:11:00,079
just to improve the the user interface

235
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:01,040
um regarding the routing this um this

236
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:04,000
tsp

237
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:05,120
approximation only is according to the

238
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,240
distance on

239
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:11,279
on the map uh if you have small

240
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:13,920
areas then um you get well

241
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:15,760
you get no or almost no distortion on a

242
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:19,599
mercator projection

243
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:20,640
um and you you get good results but you

244
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,360
can also use

245
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:24,160
or you can even you can further improve

246
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,560
improve the

247
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,519
the result if you use routing algorithms

248
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:31,920
according to

249
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:35,040
or using the the roads and highways

250
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:36,000
and you can also use this the result as

251
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,240
an input

252
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,760
for other optimization or algorithms

253
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,800
like the two-opt

254
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:44,800
algorithm which run much faster than

255
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,000
than before they don't give better

256
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:50,880
results but they

257
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:54,399
they are um they finish much earlier

258
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:55,360
yeah basically that was everything i

259
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:57,839
wanted to tell you

260
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,839
without

261
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:05,279
without maybe we could make a little

262
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:05,279
bridge what is your question to the room

263
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:09,279
my question to the room um

264
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:16,160
could you imagine to use such a

265
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:20,000
such system which very easily

266
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:23,600
gives you a short round-trip route

267
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:26,720
for whatever purpose as i already said

268
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:29,040
geocaching if you want to to find 10

269
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:31,519
caches on a day or so then you have to

270
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:33,040
well if you are visiting a foreign place

271
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:34,720
or

272
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:37,279
for instance if you get to brussels

273
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,720
you'll find several 10 geocaches on the

274
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:40,399
map and then

275
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,760
have to sort have to order them

276
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:46,480
according to your

277
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:49,600
to have to find the visit order

278
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:51,519
so that's what i wanted to say um

279
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,040
something like that or if you know

280
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:56,480
someone who does home care

281
00:12:53,040 --> 00:13:00,079
or works for dpd or

282
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:02,880
is recharger e-scooter researcher

283
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:02,880
recharger

284
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:09,760
the room anybody interested in this or

285
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,959
could see

286
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,959
somewhere in pinterest

287
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:21,839
is there anybody yeah yeah

288
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:33,200
and we have a lot of contractors that

289
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,680
need to

290
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,880
go through different port uh rooms in

291
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,719
the in the airport

292
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,720
it's quite interesting because we they

293
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,760
need to go through security filters and

294
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,600
other things to go

295
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:45,120
somewhere in place and then you get out

296
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:48,959
and you go to other places

297
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,959
and actually i'm finished

298
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:07,279
indoor at the airport but then even this

299
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,959
algorithm i just presented it would

300
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:11,519
probably could help you

301
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:12,560
if you if you put another algorithm on

302
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:15,680
it

303
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:17,839
which also considers the the waiting

304
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:22,000
times at the security filters

305
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:24,639
um to get well to quickly get a result

306
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:27,120
because those algorithms if you have 10

307
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:29,839
or several 10

308
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,399
locations they usually they have certain

309
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:33,040
they have

310
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:35,199
immense run times they are rather slow

311
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:38,639
because this traveling salesman problem

312
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:41,040
is one of the the most complicated um

313
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:44,079
or most complex solvable problems in

314
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:47,040
computer science

315
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:47,040
it could help yes

316
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:51,439
would a conversation at another time

317
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:55,199
another place

318
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,199
be worthwhile for the two of you

319
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:58,399
yeah well you you have something out of

320
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,680
this meeting

321
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:03,839
that i think will work for you is there

322
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:06,719
anybody else who has a question to

323
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:08,720
yeah yeah it's such a bummer with the

324
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:11,440
screen so i thought maybe it would be

325
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:12,959
nice that if like if anyone's interest

326
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:15,680
is tickled because

327
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:19,439
points faster those people with any

328
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:19,439
online resources which might have a

329
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:27,839
trace

330
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:43,759
so these addresses

331
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:44,720
you can have a look but um they are also

332
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:46,240
at the

333
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,240
currently at a low level of

334
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:51,199
implementation but

335
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:52,560
um well not really because they are

336
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:54,880
doing this hilbert

337
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:56,560
optimization and then you can't stop it

338
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,519
before that they are doing it to opt

339
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:01,599
optimization

340
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:01,600
to find an even shorter route

341
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:09,839
so

342
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:15,279
right um unfortunately

343
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,959
you have not been able to show your

344
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:20,240
algorithms like last year

345
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:22,319
yeah uh on the other hand uh

346
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:25,759
it sort of flew at the time of my head

347
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,759
but i'm not a mathematician

348
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:31,360
okay
