47
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:34,319
my name is mahmoud abdulhani which

48
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,400
none of you will be able to pronounce

49
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:39,440
but but still

50
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,480
and i will try to convince you find

51
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,920
people that java

52
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,079
is an interesting language to develop

53
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:46,160
games in um

54
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,840
and if nothing else i will change your

55
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:50,480
mind about some things

56
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,280
but but like i said before um i didn't

57
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,359
expect

58
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,959
so many of you to do java right here so

59
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,000
that's really um

60
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,000
for me personally it's a little bit

61
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,680
disappointing but uh

62
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,840
but fine for you guys right you do

63
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:05,200
enterprise java most of you

64
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:07,760
right all right

65
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:09,518
i do enterprise job as well and as you

66
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,079
can you will be able to tell i'm a big

67
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:13,440
fan

68
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:17,040
so let's see all right so um

69
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:18,560
and also like i just mentioned uh

70
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,319
this is for the benefits of people who

71
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,319
are not watching at home right

72
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:23,359
but like i just mentioned i really have

73
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:25,119
uh

74
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,799
a difficult time starting it off right

75
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,799
uh it's just difficult

76
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:30,239
how do you start right and i used to

77
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:31,519
make fun of people you know and when you

78
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,040
you always have those talks and the

79
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:35,040
first couple of slides are about your

80
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,720
hobbies and whatever and how many cats

81
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,920
you have and that kind of stuff

82
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,120
but until you give a talk and when you

83
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,159
give a talk you kind of understand

84
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,920
because

85
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:43,359
how do you start a talk right this is a

86
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,720
room full of people you don't know the

87
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:48,480
people you don't know their interests so

88
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:51,599
how do you start so so introduction

89
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:54,739
right so um yeah

90
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:55,920
all right so so so my um

91
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:58,640
[Music]

92
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:00,000
okay again so background of course like

93
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,439
i said in the description which

94
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,599
i think nobody read about the

95
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:06,079
description right

96
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:07,679
the reason i'm doing this is because i

97
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:11,280
importing doom 3 to java

98
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:14,560
right and i learn a lot of stuff

99
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:16,478
so this is

100
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,680
okay i don't know i'll just go through

101
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:19,039
this right

102
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,959
most of my slides are like this actually

103
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,800
so it's kind of boring but we'll see

104
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:24,960
all right so june 3 right so that's the

105
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:27,040
name of my project right because

106
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,159
we are excellent at naming stuff right i

107
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,759
don't know and like i said

108
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,759
like i said here it's a temporary name i

109
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,960
honestly i just you know i did you need

110
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:33,600
to create a new project so what do you

111
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,440
call it yeah

112
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,759
june 3 right at first i thought i would

113
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:39,520
call it doom 3 j right like 4j like

114
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:41,040
everything in java like log4j whatever

115
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,719
for j but 3j

116
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:45,040
but then i named it this and whatever

117
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,840
right it's up on github

118
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:49,280
you can check the codes and uh i don't

119
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,679
know why

120
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:53,280
so this is the question uh everybody

121
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,400
seems to ask me so why are you doing

122
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,880
this right

123
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,560
and the honest answer and most people

124
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,680
find this answer very amusing but it's

125
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:03,120
not meant to be amusing

126
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:05,039
it's that i don't remember um thank you

127
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,320
yes but it's honestly not meant to be

128
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:07,599
amusing like i said this is just i

129
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:10,800
honestly don't remember

130
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:14,479
i started it as five years ago kind of

131
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,039
right sorry but i don't remember why i

132
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:17,280
started

133
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:18,479
to be honest right i have some ideas

134
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,239
about why i started it

135
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:22,000
but i don't remember the exact reason i

136
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,880
started right

137
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,400
um but as far as i can remember right so

138
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,400
five years ago i had the doom three

139
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:31,280
source code on my hard drive

140
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:33,440
and it was just there um that's it i

141
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:35,039
started reading it and i thought

142
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,639
i think this is how it went it probably

143
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:38,960
didn't go like this but you know i

144
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:41,199
thought hey this is a cool project

145
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,400
um and what i just mentioned five years

146
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:45,520
ago right

147
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,080
uh at the time this i do remember at the

148
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,320
time

149
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,120
i thought i would be done in six months

150
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,680
i thought no

151
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:53,120
seriously i thought i six months i would

152
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,280
be able

153
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,199
i was i would be done one thing and the

154
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:59,198
other thing is i would be

155
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:00,720
the the java version would outperform c

156
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:04,080
plus plus version

157
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:08,240
right so yes planning right

158
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:11,359
so anyways um i'm sorry

159
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,840
so yeah five years right so what what

160
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,080
what's

161
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:16,318
what's what do i use i only use core

162
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:19,039
java and i only use opengl and opengl

163
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:19,600
um wrapper and openhair wrapper that's

164
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:21,759
the same right

165
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,840
actually but whatever and if you have

166
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:27,440
any questions remarks or

167
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,440
whatever just send me over there right

168
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:35,840
let's see so my um

169
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:40,080
yeah so i'm not an expert obviously

170
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,680
right um

171
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,960
one time this is very interesting

172
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,919
actually because in the description

173
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,840
usually i say

174
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:47,520
this is a hobby project right one time

175
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:50,159
after somebody came starting

176
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:52,159
talking to me uh that this is an

177
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,479
official part of doom three to java

178
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,919
right

179
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:56,159
and i'm officially affiliated with this

180
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:58,240
software which is not true

181
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,680
i'm not officially affiliated with

182
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,360
anybody so myself

183
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,720
but i'm like not an expert not an expert

184
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,919
game the developer but

185
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,919
i don't actually see myself as a game

186
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:07,919
developer my expert in java

187
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:09,120
which is very important my experience

188
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:10,318
people spot i'm not experiencing a lot

189
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,560
of things

190
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:13,680
i tend to defend a lot of people when i

191
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,880
talk about this stuff so

192
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:19,919
i'm sorry if i find you and

193
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,800
i hope somebody learns something least

194
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:22,560
of all

195
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,319
or to come to any of my talks again

196
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:28,080
right um

197
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:31,919
so yeah this is just my disclaimer right

198
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:33,680
so yeah like i said

199
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:34,960
i expected less people here to know what

200
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,039
java is

201
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,560
but but this is kind of important to the

202
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:41,120
the context of the rest of the talk

203
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,479
right so what is java right

204
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,000
so yeah some people say it's interpreted

205
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:44,960
language some other people say it's a

206
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,160
compiled language

207
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,680
some other people say it's something

208
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,240
else it's actually something else it's

209
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,759
not really

210
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,680
interpretive it's not really compounds

211
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:54,400
right who doesn't

212
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,199
know actually you know i'm just going to

213
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:58,799
explain it

214
00:07:55,199 --> 00:08:02,639
right now okay this will come back later

215
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:04,960
just uh ignore this for now right

216
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:07,599
so yeah open source java is open source

217
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:09,919
which isn't actually 100 true right

218
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:12,800
so if you go to the java room here at

219
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:14,878
foster it's called free java

220
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,000
and if you ever thought why it's called

221
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:17,840
free java

222
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,360
it's because not everything in java is

223
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:22,318
actually open source

224
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,800
which is a very complicated story and i

225
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,240
think

226
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,919
most of you know this better than me

227
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,479
because i don't know the exact details

228
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:28,639
of why

229
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:30,318
right some people blame oracle for this

230
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:33,839
but this is a problem that existed since

231
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:36,000
java was sun actually so but

232
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:37,599
mostly you know the great the biggest

233
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,240
part of it is open source which is also

234
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:42,240
important for the rest right

235
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,320
java chose to do sign math right so

236
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,519
signed and unsigned right so unsigned is

237
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,839
numbers that don't have

238
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:49,279
any negative uh components they are

239
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:49,600
basically positive so if you have 32

240
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:52,160
bits

241
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,120
32 bits of positive joy and whatever

242
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:55,120
right

243
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,399
and java chose not to do this and the

244
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,720
background story behind this

245
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:00,800
which is a kind of funny story is uh

246
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,240
james gosling back in the day

247
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,319
he couldn't decide whether to put

248
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:06,880
unsigned math in java or not

249
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,399
so what he did at sun he wrote a lot of

250
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:11,040
equations on science math

251
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:12,800
in the hallways right and he just asked

252
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,959
all the engineers at sun to solve it

253
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,719
to solve them and surprisingly enough

254
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:19,839
not a single one was solved correctly

255
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:22,320
so we decided it was a bad idea um

256
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:23,440
i disagree with him but that's that's

257
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,800
he's him and i'm me

258
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:31,440
right so that's something else

259
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:33,920
um java we use references for everything

260
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,880
which is strange that's not strange it

261
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,479
is what it is right

262
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:38,080
just this what is strange is that you

263
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:41,040
have no points or exceptions

264
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,440
when you don't have pointers right um

265
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,199
and

266
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,720
the reason this is strange if you don't

267
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,640
know why this is strange actually

268
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,880
is because technically speaking a

269
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:50,480
reference could never be null

270
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,240
but the way we use references in java

271
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,839
they can be null because we use a kind

272
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,080
of a hybrid reference it's something

273
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:57,519
in between a reference and a pointer

274
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,519
something weird

275
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:01,440
uh that's why it's reference by value is

276
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:05,200
actually more accurate

277
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:06,959
right um yeah we don't support operator

278
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,360
overloading

279
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:11,439
so yeah if you've ever tried to write a

280
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,680
game engine a 3d game engine especially

281
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:15,839
right without operating overloading it's

282
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:18,239
very very annoying

283
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:19,600
it's very difficult um i remember

284
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,800
talking foster them i think last year or

285
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,320
somebody or something and somebody

286
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:24,160
mentioned the same thing and he had this

287
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,320
comments which i love it's like

288
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:28,560
doing math he was talking about go i

289
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:30,640
think but doing like this kind of math

290
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,760
without operating overloading makes your

291
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,040
eyes bleed right

292
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,880
it's just just terrible it's just

293
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,560
terrible and there's also a lot of

294
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:39,200
stories about why they didn't do that

295
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:40,239
but we'll not get into this because i

296
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,800
stuck with time

297
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:44,399
and my time isn't working how much time

298
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:47,199
do i have

299
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:49,040
how much time do i have people in blue

300
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:51,839
i've been talking 10 minutes

301
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:53,839
seriously okay i've been talking 10

302
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:54,880
minutes on slide one or slide two two

303
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:56,800
whatever right

304
00:10:54,880 --> 00:11:00,000
and in java we have final which is kind

305
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:02,160
of like cons but it's not ready right

306
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,160
so

307
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:09,199
yeah so i'm going to give you this slide

308
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:09,200
i'm going to skip this one actually but

309
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:16,240
right so i love this comment on on stack

310
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,640
overflow

311
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,079
i know it's from hacker news about why

312
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,519
java kind of sucks right

313
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:23,519
i'm not sure if people can read it in

314
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:24,320
the back but if you can't it's amazing

315
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,680
just trust me

316
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,399
and when other people start to laugh

317
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:30,640
laugh with them it's just amazing right

318
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:31,680
but this is absolutely true right

319
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:34,240
there's a lot of

320
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,880
like a lot of the hate that comes with

321
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:38,399
java

322
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:39,839
is just like you know it's

323
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:41,360
it's what people are used to doing in

324
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:42,000
java right the way people are used to

325
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,959
writing code

326
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
in java like ghettos and setters right

327
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:46,560
everybody here writes together and

328
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,600
setters

329
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,839
have you ever thought that there was a

330
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:52,399
 idea right because

331
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:53,519
yes thank you because it is right you

332
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:55,360
actually don't need it

333
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:57,040
there is a historical reason for why you

334
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:59,680
needed it like

335
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:01,199
10 15 years ago but people forgot that

336
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:03,439
reason are still doing it

337
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,639
but we actually don't need them right

338
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,160
i'm not talking about something like

339
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:08,320
project lombok or whatever no

340
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:10,000
you don't actually need them and when

341
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:14,160
you write gutters and settings you force

342
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:16,000
the jvm to to do like an extra compil uh

343
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:18,000
extra optimization stuff for you

344
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,959
right which shouldn't be there anyway

345
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,519
because you're creating like an

346
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:22,479
interaction

347
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:23,360
right but whatever right but that's

348
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,800
that's like uh

349
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:28,639
i just love this anyways so

350
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:30,639
i'm kind of like uh so how many people

351
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:32,639
don't know these terms

352
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:34,320
be honest you're not appearing on the

353
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:38,160
camera anyway right

354
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:39,600
yes okay so yeah so actually the first

355
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,880
slide you know talking about java was

356
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,800
kind of like me ranting about all this

357
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:44,639
 i hate about java right

358
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,920
this is actually so what is java right

359
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:47,839
so java because you can

360
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,959
call a lot of things java but it's it's

361
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:50,720
kind of inaccurate

362
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:52,560
in times and it's kind of incomplete all

363
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:55,600
the time so you have the jls

364
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:57,760
java something something it's a language

365
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,360
language specification actually right so

366
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,800
some people call that java right because

367
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,720
the language specification is completely

368
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,359
open source and if you implement it to

369
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,279
the

370
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,360
sorry you can implement it in your own

371
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:08,160
way as long as you produce produce these

372
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,720
results

373
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:12,399
and we will recognize you as java right

374
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,639
so that can be java

375
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:16,240
you have the jdk or the language itself

376
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:17,120
right so the actual code you write which

377
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,399
is based on the

378
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,880
specifications some people call that

379
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:21,839
java maybe it is other people and most

380
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,680
people actually

381
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:25,279
or most purists right they tend to call

382
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,719
this java actually right so the jv and

383
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:28,720
the java virtual machine

384
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,240
which does garbage collection for you it

385
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,560
does just a long

386
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,440
compilation for you would which has the

387
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:36,880
java

388
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:39,040
java memory model for you right um

389
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,880
so it's kind of strange what's called

390
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:44,560
java whatnot right

391
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:47,680
but we'll get to that so to you

392
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:51,119
right because no no it's just something

393
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:54,319
so uh one no yeah

394
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:55,920
just just no no it's just uh

395
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,760
because i saw you i started closing your

396
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,560
eyes right and one time i was given a

397
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,240
talk

398
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:02,479
right and i saw a gentleman in the first

399
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:04,240
store he was just like snoring right

400
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,839
obviously right it was after lunch and

401
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:07,279
people say i have a soothing voice or

402
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:08,800
boring but which is code for boring

403
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:10,480
voice right right

404
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,079
and i just thought but at the end i gave

405
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,760
a demo and he was just clapping like

406
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:15,599
like crazy like like he was awake the

407
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:17,760
whole talk but whatever doesn't matter

408
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,279
so i don't blame you that's that's my

409
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,959
thing right

410
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:22,560
a friend of mine gave a talk once you

411
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:23,359
know he did it it was a lightning talk

412
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,680
and he did it like

413
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:27,040
like a boxing match right so at first i

414
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,560
wanted to structure this talk like a

415
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:30,639
boxing match the same way because i like

416
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:32,239
that really right which i didn't

417
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:33,680
in the end right but i had made this

418
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,800
slide already and i love this flight so

419
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:37,599
i just kept this line

420
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:39,359
right uh but this is the idea right so c

421
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,480
is the reigning king of the game

422
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,680
development world right

423
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:44,399
whether you like it or not whether you

424
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:46,079
admit it or not right and i see java as

425
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:47,680
kind of like a contender right

426
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:49,439
it has a lot of good good stuff that it

427
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:51,439
can offer i think it can offer right i'm

428
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,040
gonna kind of like like show it right

429
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,560
which again doesn't work very well

430
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:59,839
because most of you do java

431
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:59,839
but i'm gonna do it anyway right um

432
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:05,279
yeah yeah i was listening to this song

433
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:08,959
while i was does anyone know

434
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:11,680
what song this is excellent

435
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:12,399
so i was listening to this song and just

436
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:16,079
wrote it here

437
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:18,000
so yeah right

438
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:19,359
so like i said this is based on a

439
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,800
project i did right so the first thing

440
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,320
you come across is setting up your

441
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:25,680
environment right

442
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,240
and i cannot stress enough how much hell

443
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,160
it is

444
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,360
to uh set up an environment to see plus

445
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,360
plus right

446
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,800
um the reason i'm still using this

447
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:35,600
laptop with 70 or

448
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:37,040
70 or a year old laptop will have like a

449
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:40,000
couple of months

450
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,480
old laptop at home is because i have set

451
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,320
my seat

452
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,759
bus environment on this laptop and i

453
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,880
don't want to do it again on my other

454
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:47,040
laptop

455
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:49,439
and i know it sounds stupid but really i

456
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:51,839
hate it i hate it so much right

457
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:53,600
um but i'm not a full-time people

458
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:55,040
possible so it's probably easier for

459
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:57,120
them but still there's so

460
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:58,079
much that can go wrong right you have to

461
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,680
like

462
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:01,199
you have to have the right dlls the

463
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:04,638
right version 32-bit

464
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:06,319
64-bit set up the linkers you have a lot

465
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:07,440
of like macro and pre-processor

466
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:10,000
you have to deal with

467
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,720
it's like it's really hell right and

468
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,079
this one

469
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,560
right so this one is actually this

470
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:16,560
comment here right so at one point

471
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:17,599
i upgraded to a different i had i have a

472
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,279
different laptop with a

473
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,120
different version of visual studio we

474
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:22,000
just didn't work right because the

475
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,639
project was written

476
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
in that visual studio and you have to

477
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:27,440
have like the professional version and i

478
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,519
was using the express version because

479
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:31,839
i'm cheap right and it didn't work

480
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:33,600
right so it was just hell right and

481
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:36,160
these are two guides

482
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,920
overwritten one is for this is for

483
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,240
windows and this is for mac os right

484
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,560
it's

485
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:42,000
kind of more detailed only to get the

486
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:44,560
project running in your

487
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,000
ide that's the only thing in this guy

488
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:49,439
it's a very long guide

489
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:53,759
right and it's a lot of work and yeah

490
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:56,079
so uh um

491
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:58,000
yeah money uh does anybody know what

492
00:16:56,079 --> 00:17:01,120
scam says

493
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,399
yes thank you you can come sit over here

494
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:05,520
as well

495
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:06,799
no but so sconce is kind of like uh

496
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,879
if you know what make is it's like a

497
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:10,400
supermake let's go with that right

498
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,600
and this is one of the things it was

499
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,959
also included in the project so it's a

500
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:13,839
visual studio project but they also had

501
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:15,600
like a sconce

502
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:16,958
file which you can see as a super make

503
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:19,119
file right

504
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:20,079
uh for the linux build of of the game

505
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:22,958
right

506
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:23,359
and i want to do some benchmarks for gcc

507
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:26,559
uh

508
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:28,399
so i just thought it would be easy to do

509
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:28,799
this right to just load the scones file

510
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,600
and

511
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:33,520
and compile it and it wasn't right it

512
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:36,159
was really a lot of work

513
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:37,360
uh i i i can't i won't describe it here

514
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,640
because i've already ranted about this

515
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,719
enough right

516
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,160
um chromium let's not talk about

517
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,000
chromium

518
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:45,840
suffice it to say it takes like a day to

519
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,039
compile it but that's that's a different

520
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,879
story

521
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:50,240
but yeah so so this is this this is

522
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,840
people's plus right this is

523
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,880
very difficult it takes a lot of time

524
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,480
right you have a new developer you want

525
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,000
to set up your environment you literally

526
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,760
you're literally doing it for a day or

527
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,679
whatever right and it works sometimes it

528
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:02,240
doesn't you upgrade it doesn't whatever

529
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:03,840
it's difficult right but this is kind of

530
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:06,960
actually what we want right and this

531
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,959
kind of what we get in java

532
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:13,039
and the reason i say kind of is because

533
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:15,120
like most of you know

534
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:16,640
you can this up anybody can it

535
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:18,080
anybody can make anything as difficult

536
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:20,080
as they want

537
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:21,120
but in the purest sense you can make it

538
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:23,199
this easy right

539
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:25,039
you download an id it has a jdk

540
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,919
sometimes it has maven sometimes and

541
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:28,720
that's it

542
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:29,120
you load in your project and it works

543
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,080
right

544
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:34,080
most of the time but like i said you can

545
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:37,520
make anything difficult for everybody

546
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:39,439
but yeah right so this is kind of like

547
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:42,480
how i see it in java right you have a

548
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:45,120
lot of wizardry stuff

549
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:46,640
right nowadays in intellij you can just

550
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,239
point it to a folder and say that okay

551
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:50,080
load some stuff and it will figure out

552
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,840
how many projects you have how many

553
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:53,600
dependencies you might have and not have

554
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:55,600
and that kind of stuff

555
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:57,199
they're getting good at it right and

556
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,959
it's mostly open source

557
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,320
right in the cpus world everything is

558
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,679
closed source and everything you have to

559
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:03,039
pay for

560
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:04,559
and sometimes you have to pay a lot of

561
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:06,080
money a friend of mine wants to use like

562
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:08,240
three plugins from a company

563
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:10,000
it was like one plugin is 5 000 but if

564
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,440
you buy all three you get them for ten

565
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,760
thousand dollars right

566
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,480
and we were very simple algorithmic

567
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,400
plug-ins right

568
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,520
he could only implement them himself

569
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:20,720
which he did

570
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:22,480
right because it was cheaper right so uh

571
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:24,480
but that's the world of cps plus it's a

572
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:26,080
different world right but not everything

573
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,480
is fine of course in the world of java i

574
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,320
mean

575
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:30,080
paths right you have to set up so many

576
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:33,120
paths if you want to run it from

577
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:34,799
command line which can be shitty and

578
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:37,760
sometimes 32-bit versus

579
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:39,520
64-bit can be very annoying right

580
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:41,840
especially if you do native code

581
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:43,120
stuff like what i do with opengl and so

582
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:45,280
and such

583
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:46,159
so it's not perfect of course but i

584
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:49,440
think it's

585
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:51,280
it's better than c plus plus

586
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:54,080
right how many of you do see plus i

587
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:57,360
didn't ask that actually

588
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:59,520
wow i feel betrayed right it's like

589
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,639
it's like the same people also also do

590
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:04,000
java actually right

591
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:07,840
so but but okay so

592
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,840
uh all right

593
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:12,720
oh i thought i'd remove this slide but

594
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,720
okay

595
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:18,720
so another thing right like i just

596
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:21,360
mentioned make files right

597
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:22,320
how many of you okay let's let's not

598
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,000
keep doing that

599
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,520
right i actually find it annoying when

600
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,880
speakers do that but i

601
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:31,840
sincerely want to know which is weird

602
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:33,600
um but if you've never used a make file

603
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:35,199
or any make so i use it i

604
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:37,360
use the word x-make because there are a

605
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:40,000
lot of variants to make and q make

606
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:41,360
or whatever um but they're essentially

607
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,640
mostly the same

608
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:44,479
and if you've never used them they're

609
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:46,000
basically just meant for building like

610
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,320
you can do some testing sometimes you

611
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,159
can

612
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:50,158
have some profiles in there sometimes

613
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:52,000
depending on like sconce can do a lot of

614
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:55,280
cool stuff

615
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:59,440
right but it's not amazing right

616
00:20:55,280 --> 00:21:01,200
and if you've never used maven which is

617
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,480
some of you right you can do a lot of

618
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:05,039
cool stuff in me

619
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:07,200
right so a lot of this stuff you can do

620
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:09,360
also in make files right but this one

621
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,640
right this is most important one i think

622
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:13,039
this really makes

623
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,679
me even the best thing ever right and

624
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:16,720
and and

625
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:19,039
that's yeah how to explain this

626
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,039
um

627
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:24,000
i don't know how to explain this does

628
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:26,559
anybody know how to explain this

629
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,679
does anybody want to explain this uh so

630
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:28,960
transitive dependencies

631
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:30,240
especially right so when you have a

632
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,520
dependency that has a different

633
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,600
dependency right

634
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:36,320
usually if you have a pom file if you

635
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:37,678
have a maven file or uh or a make file

636
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:39,439
one of those cool make files that have

637
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:41,039
dependencies because most of them don't

638
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:42,640
you just know what the dependency is but

639
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:43,600
you don't know what the dependency

640
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,360
depends on

641
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:47,039
right maybe sometimes you do maybe

642
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:49,678
something you don't maven

643
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:51,760
deals with this right maven is excellent

644
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:53,120
in this right it will get the transitive

645
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:55,120
dependency for you right

646
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:57,439
the right version as long as you adhere

647
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:58,719
to the maven like like strategy right

648
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:02,159
i think this is really really really

649
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:05,280
amazing right and

650
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:05,679
java cool right c plus plus doesn't have

651
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:08,480
this

652
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:10,000
um when i talk to a lot of friends of

653
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:11,360
mine who do full-time cheapest plus

654
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,159
they're also amazed that supersport

655
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,520
doesn't have this

656
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:15,760
because it's actually kind of a very

657
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:16,158
simple problem to solve well the problem

658
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,919
is

659
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:19,600
plus everybody's very protective about

660
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:21,919
their own things right

661
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:23,520
and nobody wants to communicate or like

662
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:25,520
say okay we're gonna have one standard

663
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:30,400
or whatever so

664
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:30,400
but it's it's kind of simple so but yeah

665
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:41,280
yeah this was tweeted a couple of days

666
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:43,520
ago did anybody see this

667
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:44,879
so when you see something like this

668
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:46,960
right

669
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,919
and you've never done c plus you're kind

670
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,840
of amazed by it

671
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:51,440
right something takes 48 hours to

672
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:53,600
compile and with

673
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:55,360
one small optimization it goes to four

674
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,158
hours which is still a lot of time

675
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:58,719
actually right

676
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:59,840
i know tensorflow is huge but still

677
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:02,480
right

678
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:04,240
um so this is something so this is this

679
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,720
is the part where i talk about where i

680
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,240
uh

681
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:09,120
needed to do some scone stuff to do some

682
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:12,640
benchmarks right so at the beginning

683
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:14,320
right compiling doom three and john and

684
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:16,400
c plus plus right it took me really like

685
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:17,520
25 minutes but the reason i have a

686
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,640
question mark is because i don't have

687
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:20,400
windows 7 anymore

688
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:22,000
so i can't really reproduce it so you

689
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:25,440
just gonna have to trust me right

690
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,240
so uh it's so yeah but yeah now it takes

691
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,400
like 10 minutes

692
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,520
right you do like a multi-processor

693
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,440
after my switch

694
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:33,039
right it takes three and a half minutes

695
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,720
with 100 cpu

696
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:36,480
and this thing has like eight logical

697
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:38,559
cores i think which is

698
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:40,640
a lot even if it is like a six seven

699
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:44,240
year old machine right

700
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:46,000
gcc okay kind of the same

701
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:47,600
i'm not sure so when i got an error and

702
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,960
you're doing it with o2 optimization and

703
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,399
there's a reason why i did it with o2

704
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,200
optimization which i'm going to tell you

705
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,799
about

706
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,320
but when i got the error it was like 30

707
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:55,360
minutes but then i fixed the error and

708
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:58,559
took only 20

709
00:23:55,360 --> 00:24:00,240
12.7 minutes i'm not sure why and i'm

710
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:00,960
not good enough in gcc to know why

711
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,799
actually so

712
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:04,320
let's just leave it at that i know

713
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:06,080
through optimization

714
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:07,360
my code currently it compounds in like

715
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:09,279
25 seconds

716
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:11,039
and like like six seven seconds of those

717
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:12,640
are like like maven just

718
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:14,240
starting up and doing stuff doing

719
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:17,440
nothing actually right

720
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:18,720
um i think this is amazing

721
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,640
i think before game development this is

722
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,159
amazing right

723
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:23,600
you want to prototype the whole time i

724
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:25,440
know so none of these are incremental

725
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:27,199
builds right so all these are like

726
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,640
clean and builds right what it says

727
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,559
there from scratch

728
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:31,679
right oh yeah and if anybody has any

729
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:35,039
questions or remarks

730
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:35,679
any sign just shout right i prefer that

731
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:38,000
actually so

732
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:39,039
not shouting but i prefer questions like

733
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,080
in the middle right

734
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:42,080
so any questions

735
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:47,520
no really yeah

736
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,959
you have a question you want to say

737
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:53,918
something

738
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:53,919
you don't believe this it's true

739
00:24:54,880 --> 00:25:03,039
sorry you want you're trying well you're

740
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:05,200
trying to think of a question okay next

741
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:08,320
slide i'm going to come back to you

742
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:09,840
but uh but but this right so and and i

743
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:12,158
tried like like so incremental builds

744
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:13,600
are very fast of course right so

745
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:15,200
but incremental java also has

746
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,000
incremental builds right so that's why

747
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,720
i'm kind of like

748
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,880
like trying to to to compare apples to

749
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:22,880
other strange apples right

750
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,640
this is amazing i think this is amazing

751
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:26,559
right and granted this

752
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:28,720
doesn't give you an executable right so

753
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:30,879
you still the way java works of course

754
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:32,480
this is like a meta something in between

755
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,919
byte code really right

756
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:35,840
but this is the reason i did the o2

757
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:37,919
optimization here

758
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:38,879
for the benchmark right because a lot of

759
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:41,679
people they

760
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:43,520
they they they talk about this um so

761
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:45,360
like like if you talk to a jvm architect

762
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,918
or jvm compiler engineer or whatever

763
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:48,959
right

764
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:51,679
they say actually you shouldn't compare

765
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:54,000
what the jvm does for you with like pure

766
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:56,080
uh gcc right so like o2 optimize

767
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,159
zero optimization should compare to o2

768
00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:00,080
and the reason for this is because

769
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:02,080
at the end of the day the jvm still jits

770
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:04,240
code for you right it does like like

771
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,720
hotspot optimizations for you when it

772
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:07,360
runs

773
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:08,640
right and it's kind of the only way you

774
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:10,158
can compare it to something is with

775
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:11,039
optimization so that's why it should be

776
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:12,480
o2

777
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:14,240
i was kind of disappointed that the

778
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:15,600
difference in time between o0 and o2 was

779
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:18,640
so small but

780
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:19,039
that's something else doesn't matter so

781
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,440
yeah

782
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:22,080
so in in the boxing match thing that i

783
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,600
didn't do

784
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,520
that i should have done right i think

785
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:28,799
java wins here right

786
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:28,799
for me at least right

787
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:36,000
you have a question still

788
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:37,199
you have to you have to have a question

789
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,240
right

790
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:41,279
so startup times right and this is also

791
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:43,279
kind of surprised me but

792
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:45,279
uh okay so not this slide but the slide

793
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:46,880
after this kind of surprised me

794
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:48,640
so yeah i'm trying to compare them all

795
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:49,760
right so the game runs

796
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:52,400
maybe i'll show the game if enough

797
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:55,520
people want to see it but

798
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:59,520
at the end and if you have time because

799
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:59,520
how long how how much time do you have

800
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:08,000
okay all right so

801
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,919
so yeah so i kind of expected this right

802
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,679
so this is the java version this

803
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:13,440
people's plus version

804
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:15,279
which i should have maybe like labeled

805
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:16,960
or whatever right but you're signing up

806
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:17,840
the game right so java should take

807
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:21,360
longer right

808
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:23,120
it's per definition java cannot starts

809
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:25,360
faster than something that is optimized

810
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:27,439
class first because java itself has to

811
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:31,039
start the jvm itself

812
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:32,399
warm up time right so yeah so

813
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:34,559
this actually know what jvm warm up

814
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:36,320
means but you you know that and you're

815
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:38,320
gonna pretend you didn't so

816
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:40,158
but yeah right so java version of the

817
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:42,158
game takes like approximately like

818
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:44,559
nine seconds longer for the jvm itself

819
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:46,080
to start up and do stuff right

820
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:47,678
so i expected this so i'm not kind of

821
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,080
i'm not really that disappointed to be

822
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:51,360
honest

823
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:54,480
uh it it is a huge code base so

824
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:56,320
so yeah it doesn't matter right um yeah

825
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:57,360
i said their pre-warm up with a question

826
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,960
mark right because yeah

827
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:00,719
nowadays you have a lot of techniques

828
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:03,360
actually to to

829
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:04,640
to like avoid this kind of uh but

830
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,918
i'm not sure if you want that

831
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:08,320
i mean it doesn't matter it's nine

832
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:11,360
seconds who cares right so

833
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:12,960
uh so yeah um but this one did

834
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:14,479
uh surprise me right so these are

835
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:17,200
actually loading times so this

836
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:18,480
is kind of like loading the first level

837
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,840
this is the loading time of the first

838
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:22,799
level

839
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:24,320
and the java version was faster and

840
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:26,559
unfortunately i don't know why because

841
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:28,639
i kind of like just made these slides

842
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:30,639
like a couple of days ago and i was very

843
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:32,399
deadlines and stuff you enterprise

844
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:35,120
developers know how

845
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:36,879
how that goes right um so i didn't

846
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,520
really have enough time to to to like

847
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:39,600
like

848
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:41,600
like dig into this and see why actually

849
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:43,520
the the job version was faster right

850
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,799
it's not much faster but i expect it to

851
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:48,399
be much slower actually

852
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:49,918
at least exactly the reverse right

853
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:52,239
uh because always when i'm starting the

854
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:52,799
game right at the end result is always

855
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:55,679
right the c

856
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:57,440
plus version runs runs first right so i

857
00:28:55,679 --> 00:29:00,000
i honestly thought this would be

858
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:01,520
slower but it's faster i'm not sure why

859
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,840
so don't ask me that oh you have a

860
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,840
question

861
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:13,840
yes

862
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:27,840
um

863
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:41,840
who is they in this conversation

864
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:46,909
[Music]

865
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:55,600
see if they're not here they're not

866
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:56,960
allowed to hear the questions right

867
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:58,799
it's it's it's you're right now i'll

868
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:00,399
repeat the question sorry but but i'm

869
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:02,960
still trying to understand the exact

870
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:02,959
question sorry

871
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:09,840
hi hi hi

872
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:24,640
ah that way okay so the question is

873
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:26,240
so so first the clarification the

874
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:27,840
original game is c plus plus

875
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:29,360
right so it's not really a port so the

876
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:31,840
question is uh so

877
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:33,600
so the people that that did the c

878
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:35,360
passport of the game

879
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,799
did they compare to java right that's

880
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:38,399
that's basically the question

881
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:40,080
so yeah so it was originally developed

882
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:41,678
in c plus plus uh

883
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:43,600
unfortunately or fortunately i don't

884
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:44,960
know right uh

885
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,879
and actually actually funny thing about

886
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:48,080
that actually so so people will do cps

887
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:49,360
plus a little bit if you look into the

888
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:52,320
code of doom 3

889
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:53,918
a lot of it looks like c right and i

890
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:55,918
know a lot of people don't

891
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:56,960
like to admit that there's a difference

892
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:59,440
between cpc

893
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:00,880
plus but it's like a shitload of struts

894
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,440
for example they also have classes but

895
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:04,000
they have

896
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:05,120
like amazing amazing amount of structs

897
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,320
right and a lot of

898
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:09,918
c paradigms in the game right and

899
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:11,439
there is a story that says because this

900
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:12,960
was like the phase that they were

901
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:15,840
starting to learn three plus plus

902
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:16,240
which is interesting because this was um

903
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:19,120
i think

904
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:21,919
late 90s till like 2005 the game took

905
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:23,120
like five six years to develop

906
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:24,640
and this was the phase they were

907
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:26,639
learning cps plus and they didn't like a

908
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:33,840
lot of stuff so they didn't see

909
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:33,840
right another thing which yes sir

910
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:50,080
okay so you're curious about my opinions

911
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:52,080
about c versus java right

912
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:54,399
so that's an interesting question i like

913
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:56,240
c more than i like c plus plus

914
00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:58,000
but that's something personal right it's

915
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,399
not really about i'm not talking about

916
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,360
this

917
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:03,360
um for you from a game development point

918
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:06,399
of view i assume right

919
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:08,158
um yeah

920
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:14,559
i'm gonna touch touch on this a little

921
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:18,159
bit later but but right now at least um

922
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:20,480
for for the purpose of this you can

923
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:21,519
c and see possible are kind of the same

924
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:24,159
they're not the same

925
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:25,519
i know right and i'm looking at you the

926
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:28,399
one who knows what sconces

927
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:29,200
because excellent right uh they're not

928
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:31,199
the same

929
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:32,880
but for the purposes of this you can

930
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:36,399
claim that they are the same

931
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:37,840
um and the reason for that is um

932
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:39,439
yeah i'm gonna skip this for now right

933
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:43,840
but i'll come back to it later

934
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:43,840
sorry um

935
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:48,158
answer your question sorry

936
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:52,399
you have to have another question so

937
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:55,519
begin preparing for now

938
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:57,678
and all right so i don't know why

939
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:59,440
uh like i said uh why this is faster but

940
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:02,960
uh and this part as well

941
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:05,440
which is strange but i will do

942
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:07,120
that um but yeah i was was mostly

943
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:08,640
interested in the in the in the warm-up

944
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:10,479
time actually not not the loading time

945
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:12,080
itself right uh i wanted

946
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:13,919
in this slide actually i wanted to like

947
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:18,158
demonstrate that t pos puzzle was better

948
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:21,200
but it backfired so yeah doesn't matter

949
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:22,399
yeah actually when i found this picture

950
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,679
online

951
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:24,959
the first thought that came to my mind

952
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:26,240
is actually isn't this kind of like

953
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:29,279
child abuse

954
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:31,039
right because if you put your child in

955
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:31,600
this position and you photograph him for

956
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:35,120
like

957
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:37,120
or her uh for like your own profit

958
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:38,799
and fame and whatever likes on youtube

959
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:40,959
or some kind of stuff

960
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:41,840
it's kind of that actually but it's a

961
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:45,679
nice picture

962
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:48,639
data sorry right um so yeah

963
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:49,679
so multitasking is really difficult

964
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:51,440
right

965
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:52,720
um so this is something else i want to

966
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:56,480
really talk about is

967
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:58,240
is like cpu utilization in in java

968
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,679
or what you can do with security

969
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:01,600
utilization in java

970
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:02,880
which you can do with it in in c plus

971
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,959
plus right

972
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:06,080
basically can do exactly the same things

973
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:09,040
right but

974
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:10,239
but java it's it's it like facilitates a

975
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:13,918
lot of the stuff for you

976
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:15,359
right and i think the the next slide

977
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:17,440
or the one after that at least or

978
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:18,879
something like that touches on on the

979
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:20,240
thing that everybody hates garbage

980
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:22,319
collection right

981
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:23,279
um but actually garbage collection is

982
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:26,480
kind of like like

983
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:28,159
like married to uh to to to to to

984
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:30,399
multi-threading right

985
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:33,520
so yeah threading bonanza threading is

986
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:35,759
hard third safety is very expensive

987
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:36,639
i think i hope everybody knows why does

988
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:39,280
anybody know

989
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:40,399
so threat safety so the idea of threat

990
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:41,679
safety is

991
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:44,399
that when you make a structure for

992
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:46,879
example uh whatever like a list

993
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:48,239
uh threat safety means that when i

994
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:49,199
access something or i change something

995
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:50,719
in the list

996
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:52,480
not and a different thread is not

997
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:52,719
allowed to do something else in that and

998
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:55,679
so

999
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:56,959
i'm finished that's basically right it's

1000
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:57,680
actually not that at all but that's

1001
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,200
that's like the

1002
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:02,000
like the hello world example of that

1003
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:04,000
right uh so yeah java does that very

1004
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,839
well right it facilitates a lot of stuff

1005
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:09,680
it has a lot of like safe and unsafe for

1006
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:09,680
flavors of structures right like

1007
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:13,599
um yeah what i just explained is kind of

1008
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:16,240
like atom atom this is

1009
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:17,760
i don't know how it took atomicity

1010
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:21,520
you're you're a native speaker

1011
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:26,079
how do you pronounce this yeah

1012
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:29,520
what he said right atomicity

1013
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:32,400
thanks mom right

1014
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:33,599
so so basically the idea here is is what

1015
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:36,000
i actually want to touch on

1016
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:37,599
uh because there was there was a podcast

1017
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:40,320
a couple of days ago

1018
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:40,720
jonathan blow right and he he mentioned

1019
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:43,119
yeah

1020
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:44,319
you listen to it the three hour thing

1021
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:46,240
you're laughing so you have must have

1022
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:47,760
would listen to it sir

1023
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:49,279
or you've heard of okay so jonathan blow

1024
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,760
is the developer of braid and the

1025
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:52,079
witness

1026
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:52,800
right pretty cool guy not a lot of nice

1027
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:54,400
ideas

1028
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:56,079
there was a podcast a couple of days ago

1029
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:58,240
it was three hours

1030
00:35:56,079 --> 00:35:59,680
and uh and he got asked this same

1031
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,160
question right like multi-threading and

1032
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:02,160
whatever

1033
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:03,200
and his answer and the answer of a lot

1034
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:05,118
of game developers

1035
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:07,040
especially the engine developers is

1036
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:08,960
there's actually not a lot of

1037
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:10,720
things in a game you can do that

1038
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:11,040
requires multi-threading and parallelism

1039
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:13,200
and

1040
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:15,520
concurrency of that kind of stuff right

1041
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:17,200
um which might be true right because

1042
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:18,640
he if he says that he probably knows

1043
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,439
that is this better than me i have no

1044
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:21,598
idea

1045
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:23,520
uh but my problem with this idea at

1046
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:25,680
least right whether it's true or not

1047
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:28,400
is this this this kind of thing right so

1048
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:28,399
you have moore's law

1049
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:35,040
that's that you don't require

1050
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:37,759
multithreading in uh

1051
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:38,960
yeah okay but but but their comments are

1052
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,880
mostly those guys are

1053
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:42,400
like engine developers right so they

1054
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:43,520
mean like in graphics engines that kind

1055
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:46,240
of stuff right

1056
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:47,520
but give me just like one minute to

1057
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:50,160
explain this right

1058
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:51,359
um so you have moore's law you have

1059
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:53,118
ambulance now right

1060
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:55,279
moore's law says something like every

1061
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:57,359
like 16 17 months i don't remember

1062
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:59,359
somebody will know the correct number

1063
00:36:57,359 --> 00:37:01,839
number of transistors on a cpu

1064
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:03,440
thing will double right but there's an

1065
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:05,040
end of life to that because we can't get

1066
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:07,839
any smaller or whatever right so

1067
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:09,200
at some phase right we cannot expand the

1068
00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:10,480
cpu more than that

1069
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:12,720
and technically speaking of actually

1070
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:15,119
reached that a long time ago right

1071
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:17,040
but we changed how we view moore's law

1072
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:18,320
right so first we looked like okay so

1073
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:19,279
what's the maximum speed you can gain

1074
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,960
from a cpu

1075
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:22,240
and now we turned it into something like

1076
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,800
oh how many chords can you get on the

1077
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,879
cpu

1078
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:26,720
which is kind of different because how

1079
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:29,680
many cores comes back to this

1080
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:31,680
story right and how much how how fast

1081
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:34,240
something gets is is

1082
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:36,240
is this story actually an amdahl's law

1083
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:38,959
which i'm gonna screw up but if somebody

1084
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:39,279
can correct me then please right amla's

1085
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:42,160
law

1086
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:42,960
it says something like um there are

1087
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,799
certain

1088
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:46,400
not all problems can be paralyzed that's

1089
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:48,320
that's kind of like the

1090
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,440
so actually what the law says as far as

1091
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:51,280
i remember but it's kind of like the

1092
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,599
takeaway that i need here actually for

1093
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,599
this

1094
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:55,760
to prove my point let's let's go keep it

1095
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:59,760
down right

1096
00:37:55,760 --> 00:38:02,000
hello so uh sorry

1097
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:04,160
so that's that's my problem right so

1098
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,839
true not all problems can be paralyzed

1099
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:06,879
right that's what a lot of the engine

1100
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:10,160
developers say

1101
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:12,079
right let's assume that's true

1102
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:13,200
but if you like don't think this

1103
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:14,160
generation don't take the next

1104
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:16,319
generation but like

1105
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:18,399
six seven generations of graphic engines

1106
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:20,640
later right

1107
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:21,520
you're you you're gonna hit the roof of

1108
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:23,520
like i don't know

1109
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:25,119
a single core of i don't know what's the

1110
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,839
fastest now three and a half gigahertz

1111
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:28,079
or something

1112
00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:29,839
you're gonna hit that okay so you can

1113
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:33,200
paralyze the problem what done

1114
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:34,960
right i don't know right and

1115
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:36,960
yeah like this thing says okay so maybe

1116
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:37,839
we will be better get better programming

1117
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:39,760
again right because

1118
00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:40,880
we've kind of like unlearned how to

1119
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:43,040
optimize stuff

1120
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:44,960
so maybe we'll learn it again but still

1121
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:46,480
there's only so much you can do because

1122
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:47,920
it's not going to expand anymore right

1123
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,480
you're going to hit the roof and that's

1124
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,720
it

1125
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:52,480
right so that's why i think this is

1126
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:54,959
interesting right i'm not saying you

1127
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:56,240
need it i have no idea if you need it in

1128
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:57,359
doom 3 i don't really need it i have

1129
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:59,598
like two threads for the

1130
00:38:57,359 --> 00:39:00,720
whole game right and the second thread

1131
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:02,480
actually i don't need it

1132
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:04,240
but it was in there in the cpus version

1133
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:05,680
so i did it also in the java version

1134
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,879
but technically i think they were

1135
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:08,160
experimenting with threads as well

1136
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:09,200
actually so that's why they put it in

1137
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:11,598
there

1138
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:12,319
but yeah do you need it i have no idea

1139
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:14,240
right

1140
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:15,839
but it's just a question and if you need

1141
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:17,680
it then

1142
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:19,119
java is actually pretty interesting for

1143
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:22,640
you right

1144
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:24,160
and why again a cool tweet

1145
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:29,118
this one was from like a couple of years

1146
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:30,560
ago does anybody not know who this is

1147
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:32,480
all right so i assume none of you know

1148
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:34,960
who this is so this is

1149
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:36,880
tim sweeney he's like the the guru

1150
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,920
developer of unreal on all the unreal

1151
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:39,680
engines or whatever right

1152
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:41,599
he doesn't do it by himself but he

1153
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:42,960
started once upon a time by himself

1154
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:44,880
right

1155
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:46,560
and there was a discussion something

1156
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:47,040
about the garbage collection and he said

1157
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:49,200
this

1158
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:50,640
right lately the last couple years he's

1159
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:54,078
been doing a lot of research i think

1160
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:57,279
about uh dude dude

1161
00:39:54,079 --> 00:40:00,640
dude dude dude

1162
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:01,839
that's like uh okay so um

1163
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:03,040
he was doing like research about

1164
00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:03,839
programming languages and that kind of

1165
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:06,160
stuff

1166
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:07,759
and he tweeted this right it's like the

1167
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:10,078
first tweet i think i liked

1168
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:11,920
or or like saved or something like that

1169
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:13,119
right and i found it very interesting

1170
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:14,560
argument actually

1171
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:16,400
and i dare say this sweet is actually

1172
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:18,160
kind of like what made me do this talk

1173
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:19,920
so if you need somebody to blame let me

1174
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:21,520
know um

1175
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:23,040
but this is correct right so usually

1176
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:24,240
when you have like a big game engine you

1177
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:26,079
have like

1178
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:27,919
scripts right because you don't want to

1179
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:29,280
hard code everything so you want ai to

1180
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:30,480
be scripted you want your enemies to be

1181
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:32,960
scripted you have

1182
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:35,119
everything to be scripted right and when

1183
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:37,520
the scripting language gets so

1184
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:39,359
complicated or complex right you kind of

1185
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:40,800
like uh

1186
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:42,560
like interpret your own interpreter and

1187
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:44,240
your own parser for that and that's what

1188
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:46,880
he's talking about right so

1189
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:48,640
none of the developers that keep keep

1190
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:51,040
crying about garbage collection right

1191
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:51,759
they actually you know they they mind

1192
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:53,440
this right

1193
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:55,680
that you have a large overhead of

1194
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:57,680
parsing and interpreting these things

1195
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:59,200
during runtime right and they can be

1196
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:02,319
huge and doom they

1197
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:05,118
are huge right so uh

1198
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:05,839
that's interesting it has nothing yeah

1199
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:08,319
it's kind of had

1200
00:41:05,839 --> 00:41:09,759
something to do with my point right so

1201
00:41:08,319 --> 00:41:11,440
this is actually the part where i wanted

1202
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:14,480
to play this video

1203
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:16,240
um which we will try in a minute and if

1204
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:18,839
everybody stays quiet he will hurt i

1205
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:20,799
think but

1206
00:41:18,839 --> 00:41:22,319
um

1207
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:23,839
we will play it now actually because i'm

1208
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:28,880
running outside

1209
00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:35,839
uh let's see where's my pointer no woman

1210
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:35,839
let's see if it works

1211
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:46,079
can anybody hear that not even people

1212
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:46,078
all right excellent okay so uh

1213
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:51,279
okay sorry but anyways so that's

1214
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,119
actually it's related to this thing

1215
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:54,720
right embraces gc a lot of people don't

1216
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:55,599
understand how the gc works actually

1217
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:58,000
right

1218
00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:58,720
and this guy i don't remember his name

1219
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,880
brian

1220
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:02,799
something this is actually talking about

1221
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:03,760
rust right and he was using as an

1222
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:05,839
example the jc

1223
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:07,359
in javascript and i didn't know the

1224
00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:07,920
javascript script was actually garbage

1225
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:11,040
collected

1226
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:12,000
and that's my fault but but he was using

1227
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:14,960
as an example right

1228
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:16,400
is in this example it just shows that

1229
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:18,079
you can have memory

1230
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:20,480
you can have memory leaks in java in

1231
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:23,200
javascript right and that completely

1232
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:24,480
screws up your gc right and that's kind

1233
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:27,040
of like

1234
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:29,760
because the reason that's important is

1235
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:31,599
is kind of like this slide again right

1236
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:33,520
the spiky one for garbage collection

1237
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:34,960
right because the whole time

1238
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:37,759
i have 15 minutes left thank you very

1239
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:39,359
much uh the whole time people only talk

1240
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:41,040
about stop the world garbage collection

1241
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:42,880
right which shouldn't happen anyway

1242
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:44,240
right so some of you are the java

1243
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:45,440
developers and know this

1244
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:47,598
if you have a stop the world garbage

1245
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:48,160
collection something is wrong it's not

1246
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:50,880
the norm

1247
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:51,520
it shouldn't happen right but that's the

1248
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:54,319
only thing

1249
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:55,680
the outside world sees right i did some

1250
00:42:54,319 --> 00:42:57,440
digging and i didn't know this either

1251
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:58,000
actually but unity is garbage collected

1252
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:00,079
right

1253
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:02,079
unreal has a garbage collector and

1254
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:02,960
there's an awesome talk from gdc about

1255
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:05,040
mortal kombat

1256
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:06,560
i don't remember which mortal kombat

1257
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:07,200
mortal kombat has a garbage collection

1258
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:08,720
thing

1259
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:10,480
memory management more actually but the

1260
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:11,680
garbage collection you think right

1261
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:13,680
and the reason and that's actually the

1262
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:15,040
reason i put this thing here because one

1263
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:16,960
of the things garbage collection can

1264
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:18,240
solve and you cannot solve or very

1265
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:22,319
difficult for you as a person

1266
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:22,959
doing qrc solve is memory fragmentation

1267
00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:25,040
right

1268
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:26,640
so let's say you you allocate these are

1269
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:29,759
30 bytes right a and b

1270
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:30,640
are both 10 bytes right you three a now

1271
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:32,640
you have

1272
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:34,319
a gap of 10 bytes and gaffer of 10 bytes

1273
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:36,960
and you have a new object of 15 bytes

1274
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:38,640
how do you allocate it right and this is

1275
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:40,560
called memory fragmentation

1276
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:42,640
garbage collection solves the problem

1277
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:44,400
for you you yourself if you do it in

1278
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:45,920
squarespace it is solvable everything is

1279
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:47,200
solvable of course right

1280
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:49,119
but it's a very difficult problem to

1281
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:51,200
solve right

1282
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:54,880
i'm gonna skip the rest kind of because

1283
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:56,240
i'm running out of time

1284
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:58,000
yeah not everything is great of course

1285
00:43:56,240 --> 00:44:01,680
in java right

1286
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:05,680
memory footprint bad uh i don't

1287
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:09,118
but anybody no you have a question

1288
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:09,118
no user user

1289
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:16,799
i have not uh so the question is yes

1290
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:18,160
sorry uh the question is have you tried

1291
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:19,920
compiling it with growl

1292
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:21,200
to native code out of time compilation

1293
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:24,079
other kind of stuff right

1294
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:24,960
i haven't tried it to be honest um

1295
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:26,800
currently

1296
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:29,440
so these are problems i'm just trying to

1297
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:31,040
like um

1298
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:32,240
if i show you the demo at the end you

1299
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:33,359
will see that i have much bigger

1300
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:36,319
problems than this

1301
00:44:33,359 --> 00:44:37,680
right this these are just kind of like

1302
00:44:36,319 --> 00:44:39,839
because i'm like

1303
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:41,598
i'm saying a lot of bad stuff about c

1304
00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:43,440
plus which isn't fair right

1305
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:44,960
jabba also has a lot of bad stuff right

1306
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:45,760
so this is kind of like that uh but i

1307
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:47,119
haven't tried it

1308
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:48,880
uh although a lot of people have asked

1309
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:50,079
me that and i'm very curious myself to

1310
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:53,440
be honest

1311
00:44:50,079 --> 00:45:05,839
yes any other questions

1312
00:44:53,440 --> 00:45:05,839
no yes sir

1313
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:19,119
in terms of performance

1314
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:25,599
so the question is thank you

1315
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:29,760
i have encountered the same problem so

1316
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:32,160
the question is to repeat uh do you use

1317
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:33,359
java util collections in your in the

1318
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:34,319
game right because i mentioned that

1319
00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:36,160
earlier

1320
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:37,359
because his experience is they're very

1321
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:38,879
bad for performance

1322
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:40,880
this is also my experience they're very

1323
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:42,640
bad for performance

1324
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:44,720
this is also the experience of the

1325
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:45,680
developers the c plus plus version of

1326
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:46,640
the game

1327
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:49,520
because they created their own

1328
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:52,319
collections and arrays are much faster

1329
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:54,720
of course arrays are much faster

1330
00:45:52,319 --> 00:45:56,880
unfortunately i could not use an array

1331
00:45:54,720 --> 00:46:00,078
for everything

1332
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:03,440
but but i try to use arrays where i can

1333
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:06,160
um and if anybody

1334
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:07,200
wants to know more about this raise your

1335
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:08,720
hand now or

1336
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:10,560
stay silent forever or something like

1337
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:11,439
that because because this is a java

1338
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:13,040
question he knows

1339
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:14,880
what he talks some not everybody might

1340
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:15,359
this does anybody want more information

1341
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:18,240
about this

1342
00:46:15,359 --> 00:46:19,279
part we can talk more about this no no

1343
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:23,520
we can

1344
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:27,119
trust me we can but we can we cannot

1345
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:29,359
no we cannot but uh but but anyways

1346
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:31,359
uh so yeah so yeah so the memory for

1347
00:46:29,359 --> 00:46:33,839
print is just horrible in java right

1348
00:46:31,359 --> 00:46:35,119
and but yeah if you didn't expect this

1349
00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:35,759
then you're kind of deluding yourself

1350
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:38,000
right

1351
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:39,920
java it's kind of so i think i have

1352
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:42,160
another slide on this

1353
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:43,760
yeah so cpu over negligible don't care

1354
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:45,279
about that memory over

1355
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:47,040
but it kind of also depends on which

1356
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:48,960
kind of gc you use right

1357
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:50,400
so i don't remember which gc does what

1358
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:52,560
right but certain gc

1359
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:54,160
uh garbage gcs for garbage collection

1360
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:55,680
certain garbage collection algorithms

1361
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:57,279
require that you have double the amount

1362
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:58,319
of memory right because

1363
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:59,839
doubling the amount of memory you

1364
00:46:58,319 --> 00:47:01,119
actually need because you do something

1365
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:02,400
and then you copy the whole thing to the

1366
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:04,480
other thing and you copy it back and

1367
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:06,160
whatever right so it kind of depends

1368
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:08,560
and don't look at me like that i think i

1369
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:11,279
know what i'm not talking about but

1370
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:12,640
but yeah so uh uh but but yeah so it's

1371
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:13,200
terrible and to give you an example i

1372
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:14,480
didn't put it

1373
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:16,640
in here actually because i don't want

1374
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:17,920
anybody to like like put a screenshot of

1375
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:20,319
my slides somewhere and say hey

1376
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:21,119
job was terrible but like the super plus

1377
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:23,440
version runs

1378
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:24,960
this is like it's a game for 2005 right

1379
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:28,480
and it was highly optimized

1380
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:29,200
it runs i think average like 128 megs of

1381
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:30,880
ram

1382
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:32,399
and if you like like like put the

1383
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:34,480
settings to ultra

1384
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:36,960
super duper or whatever i think it runs

1385
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:39,040
like 256 megabytes of ram

1386
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:40,559
the java version runs i think an average

1387
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:43,920
or like one gigabyte of ram

1388
00:47:40,559 --> 00:47:46,880
right hey hey hey don't this is java

1389
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:48,559
but uh yeah uh but again this is not

1390
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:49,760
optimized none of my java code is

1391
00:47:48,559 --> 00:47:52,079
optimized so actually

1392
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:53,040
most of the code is is the opposite of

1393
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:55,040
optimized

1394
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:57,359
because the way i developed it i tried

1395
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:59,599
to stay true to the c-plus passcode

1396
00:47:57,359 --> 00:48:00,960
because at certain points actually at

1397
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:01,440
most points i want to debug it to the

1398
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:03,200
right

1399
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:04,880
so if i optimize it and no longer looks

1400
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:08,558
like this like cpus version

1401
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:12,000
it's kind of difficult to debug right

1402
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:13,440
uh but yeah it's even if it's optimized

1403
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,200
let's put it this way it will never

1404
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:18,160
reach what c plus plus reach

1405
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:18,558
right it will never happen right but so

1406
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:20,640
what

1407
00:48:18,559 --> 00:48:21,599
people say memory is cheap which it

1408
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:26,319
isn't but

1409
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:26,319
whatever right how much time do i have

1410
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:31,119
excellent gonna skip this because

1411
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:36,480
um yeah so these are things that okay so

1412
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:37,520
very quickly so these are things

1413
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:39,119
you don't have pointers you don't have

1414
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:40,640
macros i hate micros but you don't have

1415
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:42,480
they can be very useful

1416
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:44,000
uh they are very useful in the gaming

1417
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:46,640
world not in every cpu

1418
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:47,920
world actually um and you don't have

1419
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:48,558
operator overloading which i really

1420
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:50,800
really miss

1421
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:52,079
right uh i even wrote something for

1422
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:53,359
operator overloading but that's a

1423
00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:55,680
different story

1424
00:48:53,359 --> 00:48:56,480
uh but you have type safety which i

1425
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:59,200
really love

1426
00:48:56,480 --> 00:49:00,640
right and like i said i'm gonna skip

1427
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:03,040
this i'm just mentioning it because

1428
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:04,558
i don't know why uh so yeah so this is

1429
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:06,480
the thing

1430
00:49:04,559 --> 00:49:08,720
i think one of you two guys asked about

1431
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:10,480
this uh before it's kind of related to

1432
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:13,200
what's what you were talking about right

1433
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:16,480
so why use so you use arrays instead of

1434
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:18,558
of collections right especially right um

1435
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:19,760
seo is kind of like the java util

1436
00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:21,280
collection thing uh

1437
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:23,200
it has much more but it's kind of like

1438
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:25,040
that right and seo is like

1439
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:26,799
it's an extension c plus which has a lot

1440
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:27,759
of cool libraries right am i saying this

1441
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:29,119
right

1442
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:30,800
i'm looking at you because you know a

1443
00:49:29,119 --> 00:49:31,359
lot of stuff i miss am i saying this

1444
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:34,000
right

1445
00:49:31,359 --> 00:49:34,000
about stl

1446
00:49:39,359 --> 00:49:45,839
it's a lot lost sir

1447
00:49:49,839 --> 00:49:54,960
yeah doesn't care yeah i mean seo

1448
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:56,559
i don't know is seo actually part of the

1449
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:59,760
standard i don't know

1450
00:49:56,559 --> 00:50:02,640
it is okay so it is right

1451
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:04,880
so uh yeah i honestly didn't know that

1452
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:07,200
because back in the day

1453
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:08,480
okay so now i have no idea i always

1454
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:09,040
thought it wasn't part of the standard

1455
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:10,640
right

1456
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:12,960
i think i thought that because effective

1457
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:14,240
c plus has a separate book for stl so i

1458
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:16,240
thought it was something separate

1459
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:17,439
right but if you don't know what

1460
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:19,279
effective c plus plus is

1461
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:20,400
you know effective java that was

1462
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:21,599
actually stone from something called

1463
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:23,839
effective c plus plus

1464
00:50:21,599 --> 00:50:25,280
it's a different book and they whatever

1465
00:50:23,839 --> 00:50:28,480
doesn't it doesn't matter

1466
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:30,400
right but stl has a lot of stuff right

1467
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:32,480
but java has like a lot of

1468
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:33,839
better stuff i think right java has put

1469
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:36,640
a lot of thought into that right

1470
00:50:33,839 --> 00:50:37,759
so it's cool uh intrinsic for the win

1471
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:38,319
right so you have a lot of java

1472
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:40,160
functions

1473
00:50:38,319 --> 00:50:41,680
simple if you have a function that gets

1474
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:43,440
compiled like it is right and

1475
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:45,200
the compiler does optimization for you

1476
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:48,319
in java it's kind of different

1477
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:49,520
if you open something and i assume most

1478
00:50:48,319 --> 00:50:51,680
of you know this actually but

1479
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:53,040
but if you open something you see a

1480
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:53,440
piece of code and you copy that piece of

1481
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:54,880
code

1482
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:56,960
and you run a benchmark it will be much

1483
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:59,359
slower than if you don't run it right

1484
00:50:56,960 --> 00:51:01,200
if you run the actual call right

1485
00:50:59,359 --> 00:51:09,839
something in the

1486
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:09,839
uh yeah anybody any questions i'm gonna

1487
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:23,440
okay so to repeat the question because

1488
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:25,760
uh you're my friend

1489
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:27,040
yeah so uh because we're running out of

1490
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:28,720
time he wanted to ask a question that's

1491
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:30,240
unrelated to this but uh

1492
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:32,000
is how did i approach the inverse square

1493
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:33,359
root uh uh algor

1494
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:35,200
yeah i don't know if it's an algorithm

1495
00:51:33,359 --> 00:51:36,319
but that part right

1496
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:39,598
and if you don't know the impress square

1497
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:41,119
roots um it was something they

1498
00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:42,640
nobody knows for sure who came up with

1499
00:51:41,119 --> 00:51:46,640
it but it speeds

1500
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:48,558
um sorry

1501
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:51,598
yeah he himself says he didn't come up

1502
00:51:48,559 --> 00:51:54,640
with it right so

1503
00:51:51,599 --> 00:51:54,640
from the mit book

1504
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:59,280
it's possible i have no idea but let's

1505
00:51:57,599 --> 00:52:02,400
just assume we don't know it's just some

1506
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:03,839
aliens right we don't care but but it's

1507
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:04,480
it's a very known algorithm and it was

1508
00:52:03,839 --> 00:52:06,400
written in c

1509
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:08,480
plus and it only works in c plus plus

1510
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:09,520
because in c or c plus plus actually

1511
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:11,680
because you kind of like

1512
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:13,200
directly talk to the registers right if

1513
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:14,879
you do it without that

1514
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:16,960
yeah then you talk to a vm which talks

1515
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:19,520
to the registers which is what i do

1516
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:21,359
to answer your question like i said

1517
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:22,079
debugability is very important to me at

1518
00:52:21,359 --> 00:52:25,598
this point

1519
00:52:22,079 --> 00:52:26,319
right optimization performance only if

1520
00:52:25,599 --> 00:52:28,960
it kills me

1521
00:52:26,319 --> 00:52:30,400
then right if something takes like seven

1522
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:33,280
minutes to load or whatever

1523
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:34,800
i don't see you i don't see you so only

1524
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:36,559
if it takes like a very long time so i

1525
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:38,079
had a problem with file i o for example

1526
00:52:36,559 --> 00:52:39,839
right because i reported it the way

1527
00:52:38,079 --> 00:52:41,680
afrid does it and that kind of stuff

1528
00:52:39,839 --> 00:52:43,359
which was like the shittiest thing ever

1529
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:45,680
right uh

1530
00:52:43,359 --> 00:52:46,799
and something was was like loading in

1531
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:48,319
like

1532
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:49,839
three minutes right and then the

1533
00:52:48,319 --> 00:52:50,800
crosswalks version took like two two

1534
00:52:49,839 --> 00:52:53,680
seconds right

1535
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:55,119
so that part i rewrote in java i rewrote

1536
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:58,839
in a completely different way

1537
00:52:55,119 --> 00:53:01,839
right but mostly i don't do optimization

1538
00:52:58,839 --> 00:53:01,839
yet

1539
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:16,319
yeah but the way the way java

1540
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:16,720
implemented all that stuff is kind of

1541
00:53:16,319 --> 00:53:19,920
still

1542
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:22,480
it still holds kind of true right

1543
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:24,400
um yeah it's not 100 so yeah it is kind

1544
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:26,400
of approximation what you say

1545
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:28,160
but the the funny thing about this if

1546
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:30,400
you approximate it everywhere

1547
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:31,759
it's it's it still holds true right

1548
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:33,440
because you're off by the same error

1549
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:36,319
everywhere

1550
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:36,880
right let's not talk about this uh

1551
00:53:36,319 --> 00:53:40,400
anymore

1552
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:43,520
and but any other questions

1553
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:46,880
because yes sir

1554
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:48,559
do i have time to show them a demo

1555
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:50,640
is that including questions or excluding

1556
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:51,920
questions because i haven't had any

1557
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:55,200
questions yet

1558
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:57,280
and i need time for that so okay so i

1559
00:53:55,200 --> 00:54:00,480
have five minutes yet so i'm gonna

1560
00:53:57,280 --> 00:54:02,720
sorry yeah okay

1561
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:03,680
okay i'm gonna show you the demo uh i'm

1562
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:06,399
gonna skip this

1563
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:06,799
cool stuff just look at it cool stuff

1564
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:09,839
this

1565
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:11,280
isn't true but cool stuff uh

1566
00:54:09,839 --> 00:54:13,440
this is true right so you don't have

1567
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:14,160
console support for java which is i

1568
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:15,520
think the biggest

1569
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:17,520
problem with game development right

1570
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:18,480
because you don't have any native jvms

1571
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:20,559
for

1572
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:21,760
for most of the game consoles we know

1573
00:54:20,559 --> 00:54:22,960
but

1574
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:24,319
and this is about i don't know you

1575
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:25,440
should do this but it's just cool so i

1576
00:54:24,319 --> 00:54:27,520
want to show you guys

1577
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:28,559
apparently uh the blu-ray uh

1578
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:30,960
specification

1579
00:54:28,559 --> 00:54:31,920
uh has a part of java in it i did not

1580
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:33,680
know this

1581
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:35,359
i just discovered it like a week ago

1582
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:35,759
right and this is somebody who made a

1583
00:54:35,359 --> 00:54:38,319
video

1584
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:39,599
he created like a small game in java and

1585
00:54:38,319 --> 00:54:42,880
he ran it on xbox

1586
00:54:39,599 --> 00:54:44,559
one and then playstation 4 through

1587
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:46,319
the blu-ray the part of java that is in

1588
00:54:44,559 --> 00:54:47,760
the blu-ray specification

1589
00:54:46,319 --> 00:54:49,680
so unfortunately it's a six minute video

1590
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:51,359
so i'm not going to show maybe i'll

1591
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:53,839
show you like the part where it says

1592
00:54:51,359 --> 00:54:53,839
it's java

1593
00:54:55,440 --> 00:55:02,400
okay this didn't work okay just trust me

1594
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:06,160
it uh it's cool i don't know how to get

1595
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:08,480
this uh

1596
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:10,000
no okay that's i should have thought

1597
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:13,040
about that uh

1598
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:14,799
anyways it works it's just amazing

1599
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:16,880
just uh just search it on youtube you

1600
00:55:14,799 --> 00:55:18,880
will find it right

1601
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:22,079
this is some cool stuff i wanted to

1602
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:22,079
mention but uh

1603
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:26,078
yeah because because of the demo uh they

1604
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:28,400
were the one thing

1605
00:55:26,079 --> 00:55:29,119
that's going to start up intellij in the

1606
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:30,160
meantime

1607
00:55:29,119 --> 00:55:31,760
but the one thing i really want to

1608
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:33,440
mention is is just there's a lot of

1609
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:34,880
untapped potential in java right

1610
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:36,319
so a lot of the things a lot of problems

1611
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:37,599
that we might face in game development

1612
00:55:36,319 --> 00:55:38,240
and a lot of problems we do face in game

1613
00:55:37,599 --> 00:55:40,319
development

1614
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:42,240
are kind of easy to solve and i'm not i

1615
00:55:40,319 --> 00:55:43,599
don't mean easier in the sense so that's

1616
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:45,680
why i said rich hickey here right

1617
00:55:43,599 --> 00:55:47,599
because he has a whole talk who explains

1618
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:48,879
the difference between easy and simple

1619
00:55:47,599 --> 00:55:51,520
apparently

1620
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:53,040
i don't mean easy in the sense that it's

1621
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:54,400
you can solve it in five minutes but we

1622
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:56,000
already know what the solution is

1623
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:57,920
right but nobody does it nobody takes

1624
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:01,200
the time to actually do it right

1625
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:04,559
so yeah there's a lot of stuff like that

1626
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:07,598
and i'm going to show you the demo and i

1627
00:56:04,559 --> 00:56:07,599
mean literally the demo

1628
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:16,720
how this works yeah it never works with

1629
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:19,200
two screens in the meantime questions

1630
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:19,200
just ask

1631
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:27,359
sorry

1632
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:34,000
this is the demo this is literally

1633
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:36,319
it took me some time actually to get the

1634
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:38,799
demo itself working because apparently

1635
00:56:36,319 --> 00:56:40,720
the demo was in the olden days the

1636
00:56:38,799 --> 00:56:42,319
recent demo like months in advance

1637
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:43,759
right nowadays they don't do that

1638
00:56:42,319 --> 00:56:45,440
anymore

1639
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:47,119
you can kind of hear the music but the

1640
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:47,599
demo was made with different build of

1641
00:56:47,119 --> 00:56:48,799
everything

1642
00:56:47,599 --> 00:56:50,720
different build of the script different

1643
00:56:48,799 --> 00:56:51,759
build of like code whatever so i had to

1644
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:55,598
like do a lot of like

1645
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:59,119
exceptions into them um

1646
00:56:55,599 --> 00:57:00,319
 yeah don't comment about the mouse

1647
00:56:59,119 --> 00:57:03,119
i haven't captured it because

1648
00:57:00,319 --> 00:57:03,119
it's easier this way

1649
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:09,680
questions remarks

1650
00:57:09,839 --> 00:57:13,119
does anybody still like java

1651
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:16,000
sorry

1652
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:24,160
it runs pretty good yeah yeah so the

1653
00:57:21,119 --> 00:57:25,920
question is yes yes my friend my friend

1654
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:27,279
so how does it run right so i mentioned

1655
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:28,640
because i mentioned a lot about loading

1656
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:31,040
times and that kind of stuff

1657
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:32,319
so how does it actually run uh so my

1658
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:32,799
answer is you will kind of see it right

1659
00:57:32,319 --> 00:57:35,119
now but

1660
00:57:32,799 --> 00:57:36,480
but you know it runs pretty good right

1661
00:57:35,119 --> 00:57:37,839
and um

1662
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:41,839
one of the lightning talks he mentioned

1663
00:57:37,839 --> 00:57:43,359
something i think was about uh

1664
00:57:41,839 --> 00:57:44,799
no i don't remember which talk but he

1665
00:57:43,359 --> 00:57:46,000
mentioned something about something was

1666
00:57:44,799 --> 00:57:46,720
ported and they had to put it with

1667
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,960
errors

1668
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:50,160
right because the same errors right this

1669
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:51,200
is actually funny because i had a

1670
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:53,279
similar thing

1671
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:55,040
i have a specific level there that i

1672
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:56,799
load and it's just very slow at the

1673
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:57,839
beginning and i thought well man i

1674
00:57:56,799 --> 00:57:58,799
broke the game or whatever right but

1675
00:57:57,839 --> 00:58:00,078
then i load the seats

1676
00:57:58,799 --> 00:58:01,599
version of the game the same level it's

1677
00:58:00,079 --> 00:58:03,119
also very slow at the beginning so i

1678
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:06,960
mimic the inefficiency

1679
00:58:03,119 --> 00:58:08,240
which is very important right

1680
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:10,480
yeah i'm just skipping this stuff

1681
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:12,879
because we don't have time

1682
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:14,240
i think yeah so this is the problem doom

1683
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:17,599
is a very dark game

1684
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:21,359
right and uh oh

1685
00:58:17,599 --> 00:58:23,760
no no no i want to console yes

1686
00:58:21,359 --> 00:58:26,160
and i have to turn off shadows because

1687
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:28,000
that part is still broken

1688
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:30,558
yeah so it's a very dark game um

1689
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:31,760
[Music]

1690
00:58:30,559 --> 00:58:37,680
we don't have a light switcher do we

1691
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:39,119
have a light switch

1692
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:41,040
in the olden days i used to show them

1693
00:58:39,119 --> 00:58:42,079
wireframe but i thought we were beyond

1694
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:45,119
that point

1695
00:58:42,079 --> 00:58:45,839
so yeah we can do this i think no we can

1696
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:48,319
do this

1697
00:58:45,839 --> 00:58:49,759
we can cheat we can always cheat right

1698
00:58:48,319 --> 00:58:52,880
and the reason we're cheating is

1699
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:54,400
you get the flashlight okay you don't

1700
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:55,680
get the flashlight

1701
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:57,680
i don't know i don't know why i didn't

1702
00:58:55,680 --> 00:59:02,078
get a flashlight

1703
00:58:57,680 --> 00:59:02,078
but yeah this is really tiring

1704
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:07,279
oh i must say it actually looks better

1705
00:59:06,799 --> 00:59:11,119
from

1706
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:11,119
here so if you want to see it you can

1707
00:59:11,839 --> 00:59:14,720
uh where am i

1708
00:59:15,599 --> 00:59:20,880

1709
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:24,480
