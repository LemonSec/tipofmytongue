so yeah i'm excited to talk to you about

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:12,240
the next generation of contribution

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,599
it's a little tongue-in-cheek title

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,120
hopefully to get your attention and wake

6
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:16,320

00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:23,920
who would prefer to follow along if it's

11
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,039
easier for you to read on a local tablet

12
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,560
or device

13
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:28,880
i've uploaded these slides on speaker

14
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,560
deck slash mb broberg

15
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:33,280

16
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:35,920
second to find that if you need to

17
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,399
but yeah while i give that introduction

18
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,879
hi

19
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:40,480
i'm matt i'm a full-time technical

20
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:42,480
editor for opensource.com

21
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,760
we're really small team that produce a

22
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,279
lot of content

23
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:47,199
i'd love for all of you to consider

24
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,520
being authors if you're at this event

25
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,360
you

26
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,920
you absolutely have an open source story

27
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,600
to share i can tell you more about that

28
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,199
i also want to give a plug to brandeis

29
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,719
university in collaboration with the

30
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:58,879
open source institute is running a

31
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:00,320
really interesting master's course on

32
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:02,399
the business of open source

33
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,239
um i'm taking it right now and learning

34
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:05,360
a ton about all the things i don't know

35
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:06,960
about open source

36
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,439
that a lot of this community i believe

37
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,119
does so just to level set with you

38
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:12,960
how i'm walking into this i'm assuming

39
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:14,240
you are a seasoned open source

40
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,839
participant well i

41
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,839
am of the github generation of open

42
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,560
source tell you more of what that means

43
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,880
you could possibly maybe not recite the

44
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,720
uh

45
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,560
sff for freedoms off the top of your

46
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,520
head anyone willing to do that right now

47
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,799
okay never mind

48
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:29,439
um while i recently learned that osi and

49
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:30,880
fsf

50
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:32,320
are different i kind of definitely

51
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,039
conflated them more than i'd like to

52
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,000
admit

53
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,799
uh you think you've had to contribute

54
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,840
before git

55
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:40,320
i think that git is basically latin uh

56
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,000
in

57
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,679
in technology it's the only thing it's

58
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,720
the language franca so anything before

59
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,360
that didn't exist

60
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,640
we're all just oral tradition uh you're

61
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:52,159
probably active on irc

62
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:54,320
i'm active everywhere but irc and lastly

63
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:56,159
you care about your community as do i i

64
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:57,520
think if we can all create communities

65
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,520
where we care about each other and

66
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:01,119
people feel welcome we'll be on the same

67
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,920
page but i just figured i'd level set

68
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:04,479
with you all so

69
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,960
and you knew where i was coming from uh

70
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:06,240
because

71
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,000
i'm gonna just jump right in and say i

72
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,720
don't get irc uh when

73
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,480
i was every time i try to log into it i

74
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,160
end up getting into a bit of a tit for

75
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,238
tat with name serve

76
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,920
i'm not quite sure who i'm talking to

77
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:19,599
i'm not logged into the right place

78
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,440
i feel a little like a wizard which is

79
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:23,280
kind of cool because i'm a little behind

80
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:25,120
on my sysadmin skills these days

81
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,520
but ultimately i end up seeing a stream

82
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:30,080
of offensive spam and i'm confused as to

83
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,200
what channel i'm in and what's going on

84
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,519
and

85
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,280
that as led in the communities that

86
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:36,160
participated in where irc is a default

87
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,760
channel i'm

88
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,359
always told to you know go check the

89
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,079
manual the friendly manual that will

90
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,800
explain

91
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,599
in great detail how to use the the

92
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,000
tooling work

93
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:47,040
appropriately but i'm always left with

94
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,280
with the sense that

95
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,040
i don't get it and i feel kind of

96
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,480
ashamed about it i mean i've got a

97
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,239
degree in computer science

98
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,760
been in the tech industry for 10 years

99
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:57,680
after four years of

100
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,799
it work beforehand and i don't say that

101
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,319
to

102
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,080
to brag it's actually out of

103
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:04,079
embarrassment that like oh how can this

104
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,000
technology continue to elude me

105
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,519
on a day-to-day basis when i have this

106
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,400
foundation behind me

107
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:10,720
um but i think it comes from where what

108
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,879
my

109
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,640
point of origin was that like for me

110
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:15,760
open source started the day i made a

111
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,799
github

112
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,518
user and a user account and logged in to

113
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,959
do something

114
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:22,959
and i wanted to participate for the

115
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:25,760
first time i was very excited

116
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:27,599
pretty nervous about it and i was using

117
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,640
homebrew on mac for those that know the

118
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:30,798
package manager

119
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,000
and i opened my very first issue only

120
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:34,319
eight years ago

121
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,080
with a a bunch of junk about why the

122
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:37,440
package wasn't working for me and me

123
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:40,159
being confused about it

124
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:42,799
and to my absolute surprise and delight

125
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:45,200
immediately i hear from these people who

126
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:46,080
are uh really big names in that

127
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,599
community

128
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,400
in my stance and they actually told me i

129
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:52,798
didn't install git correctly on mac

130
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,640
it was a totally trivial issue no one

131
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,159
made me feel stupid at all though they

132
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,279
immediately pointed me towards helpful

133
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:59,280
documentation

134
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,640
and i felt like i had done something

135
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,640
like somebody else

136
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,238
has definitely felt that silly going

137
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,439
into the homebrew community and when

138
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:07,599
they look through issues

139
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:09,280
they will find that path ideally get to

140
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:11,040
the same positive conclusion

141
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,519
and see the welcoming people along the

142
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,079
way and i love that experience and it

143
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,720
really

144
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:18,720
set me up for the success towards as i

145
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,440
slowly iterated towards an open source

146
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,759
community

147
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,840
and an open source career focus because

148
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:25,520
my pathways all through proprietary i

149
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,080
started with a proprietary hardware

150
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,000
vendor

151
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,758
i found communities that are surrounding

152
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,840
proprietary technology

153
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:33,440
that live on a proprietary platform of

154
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,599
twitter and

155
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:37,280
i eventually joined a proprietary code

156
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,320
sharing site and found that to be really

157
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,880
open source and

158
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,440
fun to me and i got into open course

159
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,759
startups

160
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:45,600
that is a different conversation we can

161
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:47,440
talk about whether that works or doesn't

162
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,680
and the many ways in which it doesn't

163
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:51,280
and so on and so forth now i'm very much

164
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,880
centered around open source communities

165
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,080
as a focus of my career

166
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,759
i've got the joy of working at

167
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,120
opensource.com to get those stories out

168
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:58,000
further and to coach people through that

169
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,800
experience

170
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,160
and i continue to learn about why we

171
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,400
obsess about licenses

172
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,360
by coming to fosum and by taking courses

173
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,679
like i am

174
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:10,240
but my pathway is not the same as i know

175
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:12,560
many others have gone through

176
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,080
that started with irc just being a

177
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,639
logical simple thing

178
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:18,240
um but for me it's still it's still this

179
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:19,840
even though i understand where it comes

180
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,800
from and i understand it had its its

181
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:23,679
place in time

182
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:25,759
i feel as if it's not as inviting as

183
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,680
that incredible github issue that didn't

184
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:29,759
shame me or make me feel stupid

185
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,039
um ultimately whether that's a sign of

186
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:34,160
my posture syndrome

187
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:36,880
or or not is between me and my therapist

188
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,000
but as somebody who's as i like to say

189
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:42,080
on the easy setting

190
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:44,240
of contribution in in this world uh a

191
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:46,159
a concept taken from straight white male

192
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:49,360
the lowest difficulty setting there is

193
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:51,199
uh by john here i i understand i have

194
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,039
already a bunch of easy ways in which i

195
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:54,639
can be involved and not feel too

196
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:56,479
ashamed of things when they don't go

197
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:58,240
well that said if i can feel that

198
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:58,880
awkward i can definitely imagine other

199
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,600
people

200
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:02,479
who have a more difficult path towards

201
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,560
open source

202
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:07,840
who don't want to be as out there will

203
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,840
have more of a challenge

204
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,280
and also i want to talk about this is

205
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,600
because i'm doing

206
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:17,280
as i continue to read a lot more about

207
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,960
the inclusivity and

208
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:21,359
diversity challenges in the technology

209
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,960
space and try to inform myself while i

210
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,080
don't feel ever informed enough to give

211
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,680
a full lecture on it

212
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,440
i i do know i need to start making

213
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,680
changes in my own behavior

214
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,360
in order to improve this for those that

215
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,520
are going to be coming

216
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:35,600
forward now that are in their their

217
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:37,039
teens and their 20s and their 30s or

218
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,720
are people that are pivoting from other

219
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:40,479
parts and other industries and want to

220
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:42,080
participate

221
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:43,520
i do a lot of mentoring on the side for

222
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,120
people who are confused as to how they

223
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,639
can get involved in technology

224
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,880
and i'm consistently asked the same

225
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:51,520
question of where do i get involved

226
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:53,039
what do i do how do i do this open

227
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,000
source thing that all these companies

228
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:56,639
are looking to hire

229
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,759
for and i can't in good conscience say

230
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:59,440
jump on irc

231
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:00,800
and see how to get involved it's

232
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,639
confusing it

233
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,479
and it ultimately could make some people

234
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:06,000
feel uh like they

235
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:07,599
they shouldn't be pivoting into

236
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,960
technology that they shouldn't be there

237
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:10,560
and quite honestly it's not where their

238
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,280
community is the one that they're gonna

239
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,080
pursue

240
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:16,080
that they're gonna feel welcome in uh so

241
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:17,758
i think about how we can start to

242
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:20,000
change that and one of the talks that

243
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:22,080
really influenced me recently is by kk

244
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,240
uh creator of jenkins he had an

245
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:27,120
incredible talk at monktoberfest about

246
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,080
uh the that underrepresented people are

247
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,520
underestimated

248
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,440
but he also brought up this amazing

249
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:33,359
concept uh thank you

250
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,560
for margaret for for tweeting it so i

251
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,759
could quote it

252
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:39,599
uh about the curb cutting principle that

253
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:42,319
if you think about cutting the curb so

254
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:43,759
that people in wheelchairs can go up it

255
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:45,759
it actually helps a number of other

256
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:47,680
people along the way it helps people

257
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:48,479
with strollers or with heavy luggage

258
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,919
bags or

259
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:52,479
anyone with any form of walking

260
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:54,719
disability people who have sight def

261
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:55,840
difficulties by creating an easier

262
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,479
on-ramp for

263
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:00,400
a specific target people you have a halo

264
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:01,758
effect you end up positively impacting

265
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:04,239
all these other people

266
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:06,000
and i think about what uh what we're

267
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,319
doing as community leaders to do that

268
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,759
for

269
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:11,759
our our early onboarding for people who

270
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:13,759
maybe don't i can't just quite get up

271
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:15,520
that lo ledge right away how do we make

272
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:16,960
it easy from the beginning

273
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,719
we may have a greater impact than we

274
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:20,239
even realized

275
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,840
so to put it in some context i

276
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,199
understand when irc

277
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,719
came out and became the de facto

278
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:26,240
standard it's because there's a lot of

279
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:29,039
empty space around it was

280
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,400
irc or nothing to communicate i guess

281
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:31,680
telnetting and reading each other's

282
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,279
things is something that i've read about

283
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,560
as well but i'll just put that aside i

284
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:37,120
don't know it very well

285
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:38,799
but if we fast forward to today the the

286
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,640
stats i've been able to find is that irc

287
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:43,039
is hovering around 400 000

288
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:44,560
active users in the last year or so and

289
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:46,000
we look at some of the other synchronous

290
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,719
communication channels that people are

291
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,560
talking about

292
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,920
we've got microsoft teams as much as

293
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,439
people have to use that for work and

294
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:54,240
don't necessarily love it

295
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,440
there's 13 million people on that slack

296
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,279
people love it

297
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,720
open source communities hate it 12

298
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:00,959
million users

299
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,320
riot.i am very impressive that they've

300
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:04,880
grown to well over

301
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,399
11 million users google chat it's like

302
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:08,959
slowly waiting in the background

303
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:10,320
but at 4 million and that's just

304
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:12,239
synchronous communication channels and

305
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,000
that's just recently if we zoom out even

306
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,519
further and think about like the ways in

307
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,680
which we interact with communities in

308
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:20,720
the technology space

309
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,719
that's an interesting noise

310
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,240
i'm going to keep talking while somebody

311
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:26,399
figures that out so if we think about

312
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,160
where communities are talking across the

313
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:30,320
industry

314
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,360
you've got twitter which is my default

315
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,480
place to

316
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:35,760
conversate with community members at 126

317
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,920
million users

318
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:39,680
telegram is way more massive than i ever

319
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,040
realized at 200 million and a lot more

320
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,599
open source communities are talking

321
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,240
there

322
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:47,360
discord is humongous reddit is a

323
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:50,000
complete beast when we think about it

324
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,200
is that getting pretty distracting i

325
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,320
think it's pretty distracting i also

326
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,880
don't know how to fix it

327
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,880
true hold on all right jazz hands for a

328
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:59,519
moment and i'll just leave this for your

329
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,519
curiosity

330
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,000
not that one

331
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:12,560
uh can we just give a little love to the

332
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,560
box please yeah

333
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:19,519
if that worked that was very weird

334
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:33,839
okay that's exciting

335
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,920
electricity is strange everybody it's

336
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,439
probably some sort of

337
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,959
the noise from the audio channel of the

338
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,959
hdmi yeah

339
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:47,839
the irc gods are upset at you yeah i

340
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:47,839
know i definitely

341
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:57,279
[Laughter]

342
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,279
thank you

343
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,399
it's a video guy that was amazing

344
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:07,120
cool okay so there there is a lot more

345
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:09,040
competition there's a lot more places

346
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,079
people are conversing about open source

347
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:12,560
than ever before

348
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:14,000
and that that can be quite um it's quite

349
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:16,399
exciting but it's also

350
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,320
uh it starts to make that little dot of

351
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:20,160
irc in the middle look

352
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,440
maybe less to be centric even though

353
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,040
it's center of the picture

354
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,480
it's definitely not the dominant place

355
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:27,760
people are talking now

356
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:30,640
oh man i'm gonna like stay up

357
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:31,120
so just a quick side by side by no means

358
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,800
uh

359
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,720
inclusive of everything that's important

360
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,800
to setting up a healthy community

361
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,920
a healthy place for people to converse

362
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,240
we think about just

363
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:42,560
the sign up experience the mobile access

364
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:44,800
the inboard on

365
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:46,239
the in-app onboarding of users

366
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,719
accessibility options

367
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:50,480
uh just comparing irc to yes the hated

368
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,000
but often used slack

369
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,839
it starts to look like okay i can

370
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,279
understand why people aren't jumping on

371
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:56,079
the platform that's existed for the

372
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:57,680
longest

373
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:59,839
there are other options that are

374
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,319
definitely maturing but the default

375
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:02,320
option

376
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,680
is shifting and i'd like us all to shift

377
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,200
with it

378
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,638
and quite honestly one of the more

379
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,320
important parts is why are we using

380
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:10,560
synchronous communication

381
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,360
i am not always on and i doubt you want

382
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:14,000
to be too

383
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,399
um it's rarely the right place to start

384
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,160
so

385
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:17,839
i want to take a take a moment and talk

386
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:19,600
about why i mean

387
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:21,040
just to list five i think we can go

388
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,839
through a hundred each one of us has at

389
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,680
least one

390
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:25,360
uh that it requires it always on

391
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:27,519
participation there's this

392
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,720
expectation that it sets a default of

393
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:31,360
immediacy

394
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:33,200
uh there's no continuity of knowledge uh

395
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:35,120
when you use synchronous communication

396
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,399
if i answer a question today three days

397
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,639
later you ask the same one

398
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:40,720
you get the same question it's it's

399
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:42,320
often not a place that is building the

400
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,040
type of community that we're trying to

401
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,120
foster

402
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,800
or or maybe it is but it's it's not

403
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,760
alone there are other pieces to the

404
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,519
puzzle

405
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,800
so i'm going to pivot to talking about

406
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:52,800
community channels and

407
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,920
my theory of operation it's a model

408
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,359
that's worked for me

409
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,599
all models are wrong some are more

410
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:59,839
helpful than others this one is mine

411
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,680
um well this one actually isn't to start

412
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:04,240
this is somebody else's

413
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:07,439
so in the great good place there's this

414
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:09,040
wonderful concept of uh your third place

415
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,560
where like traditionally your first

416
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,560
place being home where you have a

417
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,880
certain sense of identity and purpose

418
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,800
and

419
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,079
and meaning your second place being your

420
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,719
work which is uh

421
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:20,560
in our culture is is just as dominant if

422
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,399
not the dominant place that you live in

423
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:24,399
and there is this magical third place

424
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:26,240
that we're all searching for

425
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:28,000
it's a place where we feel comfortable

426
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:30,480
and feel connected

427
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,760
it's where you relax in public encounter

428
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,040
familiar faces and make new

429
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:35,760
acquaintances

430
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:36,880
take a moment if think of some community

431
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,639
you participate in

432
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,320
and doesn't it check all those boxes

433
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:41,680
right away that sense of feeling

434
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,519
comfortable and connected

435
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,959
to other people there are a bunch of

436
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:46,480
other reasons

437
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:48,160
that it's interesting it's a great

438
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,880
theory of operation and i think we're

439
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,040
all building

440
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:52,240
third places as we build open source

441
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,959
communities and places where our

442
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,920
communities

443
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:57,680
interact so to take that in mind i kind

444
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,439
of break it into this quadrant

445
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:01,199
that works for me where i think about

446
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:03,199
the synchronous communication

447
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:04,399
which i don't think is the greatest

448
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:06,560
default but it is

449
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:07,600
fantastic for casual and high throughput

450
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,518
conversations

451
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,440
it's the place of banter where you start

452
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:13,199
to build some sort of connection

453
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:15,040
while asynchronous is really the

454
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:16,719
definitive record of

455
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,079
what is the right answer and what is the

456
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,760
wrong answer we all

457
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:21,120
end up making these static web pages for

458
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,560
things like this there are a bunch of

459
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,560
other tools that are useful

460
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:26,000
there's also the power and importance of

461
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:28,719
face-to-face connection

462
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
many of us flew drive took a train to be

463
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,600
here to make face-to-face

464
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,360
connections with each other because no

465
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,800
matter how much we work fully remotely

466
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,120
no matter how much we connect with each

467
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,040
other

468
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,639
as much as i love that over the internet

469
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,920
experience we still need this there's

470
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:42,399
something special about this

471
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,839
this space lastly i think it's important

472
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:44,480
to think intentionally about your news

473
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:46,160
channel like

474
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,920
how are you feeding information and

475
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,199
distributing that context to people that

476
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:51,519
care about what you're doing

477
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:53,120
it's cathedral in the bazaar like that

478
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:55,120
you need some place where i'm

479
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,880
being regularly updated with information

480
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,560
so that i know i'm making an impact on

481
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:00,560
what i'm doing

482
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:02,160
so what are some default ones

483
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,920
synchronous we've talked about

484
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,279
asynchronous you know google groups

485
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,479
that's the logo for it that no one knows

486
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:08,480
about

487
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,920
there's github is actually pretty decent

488
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,360
at asynchronous communication

489
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:14,000
people kind of bend the way you use

490
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:16,720
issues to be more about collaboration

491
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,399
discourse is absolutely fantastic

492
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,839
whether you like the creator or not it's

493
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:21,600
a really powerful

494
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:23,040
conversation and threading platform

495
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,480
that's open source

496
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,480
and you can deploy yourself or use their

497
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,880
service stack overflow is another form

498
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,720
of it

499
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:30,720
and they have their ability to branch

500
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,160
off and use your own face to face we all

501
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,240
go to them we're at a conference right

502
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,439
now user groups and local meetups are

503
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:37,360
important

504
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,800
news for better or worse twitter is

505
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:41,279
where a lot of us hang out

506
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:43,120
it's certainly been my my choice and

507
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:45,439
it's where i know a lot of you from

508
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:47,360
um but then there are infinite number of

509
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,199
newsletters and other places where we

510
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:51,360
get our news

511
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:52,639
so to see this in practice i just want

512
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,639
to give a couple examples

513
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:56,320
so mozilla recently did a huge

514
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:57,600
renovation of how they communicate

515
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,320
internally and externally with their

516
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,240
community

517
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:02,399
they landed on riot which i think is

518
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,360
really telling that it's a maturing

519
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:06,399
technology

520
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:08,240
uh it's it's a there's great research if

521
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,959
you look up mozilla's synchronous

522
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,440
communication

523
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:12,959
conversation why they chose riot they

524
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:16,000
also want to discourse for their

525
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:17,920
asynchronous so if you join the mozilla

526
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,519
community they have a whole platform you

527
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:21,599
can jump on they have

528
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:23,759
incredible mozfest and then their

529
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,680
mozilla blog is really really detailed

530
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:27,040
they are always pushing information out

531
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:29,199
and i think it's so interesting they do

532
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,680
a great job of having syndicated

533
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:31,199
channels

534
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:33,599
so they push it out to twitter they push

535
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:35,279
it out to their newsletter subscribers

536
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,880
it's like a really tight way of staying

537
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:40,000
connected to this broad

538
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:41,680
and diverse open source community if we

539
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,480
look at go the go programming language

540
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,880
for instance

541
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:46,480
they've defaulted to slack there are

542
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,480
many many thousands of people

543
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:51,120
talking about go on slack on a regular

544
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,959
basis they use google groups quite a bit

545
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,160
as well as github github issues to

546
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:55,279
communicate with each other for

547
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:57,199
asynchronous

548
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:59,279
there's a ton there's gophercon which is

549
00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:01,439
the unofficial official place to be

550
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:03,519
it's where people go year round and go

551
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:05,199
meetups are all over the world

552
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:06,480
and then they have the go blog but

553
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:08,240
what's interesting about them they have

554
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,720
more of an unofficial presence on

555
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,720
twitter

556
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,839
and email and newsletters they've great

557
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:14,000
podcasts and

558
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:15,918
uh and newsletters to distribute it out

559
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,520
go times one from changelog that's not

560
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:19,280
an official part of the go language but

561
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:21,520
it is an unofficial place that the

562
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:23,039
community circles

563
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:25,119
last but not least let's talk about

564
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:27,039
kubernetes because everybody else is

565
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:29,199
they are also on slack and it's really

566
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:31,280
interesting default channel is more

567
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:34,080
github it's a lot github-centric

568
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:35,280
while the the newsletter excuse me the

569
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:38,320
discussion

570
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:40,879
lists are a little bit of a back

571
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:42,159
back channel while the face-to-face is

572
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:45,120
really interesting they do

573
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:46,080
so many videos online so they're using

574
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,639
zoom and they're using

575
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:50,720
youtube to extend that face to face it

576
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:52,880
doesn't quite substitute the in person

577
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:54,799
because that community is getting so big

578
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:57,039
they've added this virtual element as

579
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:58,240
well i think video chats can be really

580
00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:00,480
powerful in that way

581
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:02,160
in these distributed communities and

582
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,240
their news is just as deep

583
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,520
just as distributed people filling in

584
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:07,039
the gaps that they don't

585
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:09,360
but the official channel is always their

586
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:09,360
blog

587
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,720
so if you're looking for some sane

588
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:13,200
defaults if you're building a community

589
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,200
and you

590
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:17,039
you find this framework kind of useful

591
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,640
i'd say if you're starting from scratch

592
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:19,600
i'd really recommend not going with

593
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,960
synchronous

594
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:24,719
from the start and trying to build a

595
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,880
place where you answer questions for

596
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,640
people and you can create some dialogue

597
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,880
amongst the frequent visitors

598
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,919
start to get that sense of belonging uh

599
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,679
building and then

600
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:35,360
once people really start to know each

601
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:37,520
other and you need that side channel you

602
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:39,120
need that conversation

603
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:40,879
you can do that through synchronous but

604
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,439
wait until the time zones aren't a

605
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,280
factor

606
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,880
and that you have a sense of culture

607
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:46,799
already discourse is a great

608
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,400
asynchronous communication channel i'm

609
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:50,480
really enjoying using it it's highly

610
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:52,640
customizable it's really easy

611
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:54,160
relatively easy to run on your own or to

612
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,960
they have a very reasonable cost

613
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,320
structure

614
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,679
if you want to pay for it if you're

615
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,639
looking to do face to face from the

616
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:00,559
start

617
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:02,240
look at kubernetes way in which they do

618
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:03,840
the community meetups they're

619
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:06,240
really interesting ways to get people

620
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:07,678
connected i was on one recently with 40

621
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,039
people from around the world

622
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:10,480
who were all talking about the bugs that

623
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:12,160
they had squashed that week and ways in

624
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,039
which they made contributor experience a

625
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,679
little easier

626
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:17,520
i can't talk about many communities that

627
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:19,039
have that level of scale and that number

628
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,639
of people that during the day are

629
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:22,160
jumping in and talking to each other

630
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,440
and not all of them were paid to do it

631
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,400
there's a lot of volunteers a lot of

632
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,600
people who are trying to grow their

633
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:28,400
career

634
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:30,559
and the news whether you love it or not

635
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,280
the centralization of twitter is really

636
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:33,039
effective

637
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:35,280
i look forward to understanding mastodon

638
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:36,960
a little bit more to see if that is a

639
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:39,120
collaborative place but i think it's

640
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,880
going to be an and not an ore

641
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:42,159
and then newsletters are really powerful

642
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,440
it's a great place to be

643
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,960
if you're interested in running your own

644
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:47,919
website having a blog that then

645
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:50,559
syndicates to those is really effective

646
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:51,280
so that all matters because contribution

647
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:52,720
matters

648
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:54,000
so just to pivot back into the

649
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,960
conversation of what are we all trying

650
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,039
to do we're trying to build

651
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:59,120
communications of practice

652
00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:00,799
because the actual footage of people

653
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:02,479
trying to recruit contributors is like a

654
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:03,679
hungry hungry hippos game

655
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:05,120
no idea if that reference works

656
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:07,200
internationally but i love it anyway

657
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:09,120
it's a great game

658
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,720
just to look at one of the hundreds of

659
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,840
sites that try to say good first

660
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:14,240
contributors

661
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:16,080
first contributors.github.io these are

662
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:18,320
just some of the amazing organizations

663
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:20,158
who are desperate for new contribution

664
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:21,760
to give a shout out exorcism is one of

665
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:22,960
the best place to learn a programming

666
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,520
language and it's run by brilliant

667
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,600
people

668
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:27,200
all of these others are great too but uh

669
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:29,120
everyone is very interested

670
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,400
in getting new contributions so clearly

671
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,840
there's a lot of demand

672
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,679
which means we need to meet people where

673
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,000
their expectations are not ask them to

674
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:36,480
meet

675
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,360
meet us where we already are because if

676
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:40,640
we think about

677
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:42,799
the contributor experience early on back

678
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:44,240
in the irc only days like almost

679
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:45,760
everyone who is contributing

680
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,840
or who is talking about what they were

681
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:49,200
doing was also contributing to something

682
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:50,879
because it was one of the same you had

683
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:53,120
to have that level of skill

684
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:55,200
um but now it's kind of shifted that the

685
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:57,840
contributors is a very small peak

686
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,880
in the potential contributor field and

687
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,959
if we think about it

688
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:02,880
there's like a little dot that's ready

689
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:05,600
to roll off in either direction of the

690
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:09,120
actual maintainers of the software

691
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:11,199
thank you um so i i just want

692
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:13,039
to reinforce that communication channel

693
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,720
channels are exceptionally important and

694
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:16,240
they set an expectation

695
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,679
and we want that expectation to be

696
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,880
something where people feel incredibly

697
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:20,799
welcome and don't feel like they're

698
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,320
being told to try harder

699
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:24,559
and maybe one day they'll be worthy of

700
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:27,039
being an open source contributor

701
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:28,960
it's going to be multi-channel it's just

702
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:31,600
that's the new standard that everybody

703
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:33,280
is using multiple channels if you try to

704
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,399
break it into this grid i think it gets

705
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,840
a little bit more sane

706
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,360
so you don't have a half a dozen

707
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:39,039
synchronous communication channels and

708
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:41,199
no place for the right and wrong answers

709
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:43,520
like a discourse

710
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,640
but lastly i just want to make a shout

711
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:46,480
out to the idea that

712
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:48,960
any place that is contributing to open

713
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:50,480
source is an open source community

714
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:52,400
so whether they're using slack or

715
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:54,240
otherwise you may not like that choice

716
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,799
but it is not necessarily the wrong

717
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,960
choice

718
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:58,158
we can try to grow people towards an all

719
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:00,240
open source community

720
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:02,000
and understand the nuances of it but

721
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:03,440
it's taken me eight years to get there

722
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,720
and i'm finally starting to get it and

723
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:07,200
i'd like to grow that way

724
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:08,640
but i don't want to shame or make anyone

725
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,840
else feel unwelcome because they're not

726
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,200
where i am today

727
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:13,120
so i hope we can all meet people where

728
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,559
they are today and help them grow into

729
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,399
being open source advocates and

730
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:18,320
understand the nuance of it

731
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,679
i really thank you for your time and i

732
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:22,320
look forward to hearing more of your

733
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:22,320
talks as well

734
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,840
thanks

735
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,280
that was super easy yeah

736
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:38,960
hello um so distinction being async and

737
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,959
synchronized

738
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:42,960
what i have experienced is that most

739
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:46,000
time when a community have an

740
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:48,320
asynchronous community is that they

741
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,360
demand that people installed the app on

742
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:51,840
the phone and use

743
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:53,039
push notification with them become a

744
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:55,280
synchronized

745
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:57,039
communication method anyway and if you

746
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:59,760
don't want to install the app

747
00:22:57,039 --> 00:23:01,600
you more or less get frozen out okay so

748
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:02,720
i'm hearing the question is like is

749
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:04,320
notifications

750
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,720
and that sense that asynchronous

751
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:08,000
converts into synchronous in most cases

752
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:10,159
i completely understand what you're

753
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,559
saying there i think there is uh

754
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:14,400
a level that all technology these days

755
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:15,280
is trying to steal our attention all the

756
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,320
time

757
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:18,399
and trying to get us to turn

758
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:19,918
notifications on and be as real time as

759
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:22,320
possible

760
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:24,320
i think it's not a requirement i'm part

761
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:26,158
of about a dozen different discourse

762
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,918
services right now and i just kind of

763
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:28,799
schedule out time well i turned off

764
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:31,520
notifications

765
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:32,960
and i log into the web apps and and go

766
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:36,320
in there on my own time

767
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:38,960
so i i think it does take more

768
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:40,559
mental effort than it it should i don't

769
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,039
think it's a necessity to think of it

770
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:42,399
that way

771
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:44,080
and if you think about the experience

772
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,840
like let's say the same strategy

773
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:47,600
where like i just logged in three days

774
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:48,720
later and looked for updates

775
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,879
if i do that in a synchronous

776
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,279
communication channel i've got to scroll

777
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,039
back

778
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:54,559
infinitely and try to thread in my head

779
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:56,000
the conversations that happened

780
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:57,678
while in like a discourse or stack

781
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,679
overflow experience they're all spread

782
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:00,960
out with q and a's in their own separate

783
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:02,880
categories

784
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:04,320
so more advocating for that structure as

785
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:06,480
opposed to the unstructured

786
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:08,080
if your goal is to get to a simple like

787
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,520
yes no definitive answer

788
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:11,039
if your goal is to get people to banter

789
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:12,400
with each other like choose a

790
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:15,200
synchronous channel that is definitely

791
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:15,200
the place to do it

792
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:19,919
leslie how am i doing on time more

793
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,720
questions oh cool yeah he's got the mic

794
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:24,320
i didn't mention the mailing lists i did

795
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:27,039
not mention mailing lists i would

796
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:28,639
uh highly recommend uh so i did mention

797
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:30,158
google list but i didn't give mailman

798
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:32,000
the respect it deserves i'm on

799
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:34,400
an infinite number i'd prefer not to be

800
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,640
quite honestly uh with all due respect

801
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:38,240
uh discourse has a great um built-in

802
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,840
feature where you can use it like a

803
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:42,559
multi-threaded mailing list

804
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:43,918
um it will so i think it's a one-to-one

805
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:45,440
replacement with a better user

806
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:46,240
experience for those less familiar with

807
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:48,400
it

808
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:50,080
while also providing a mailman like

809
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:53,200
experience mailing list

810
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:55,120
so i'd love for you a disagreement

811
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,640
that it where we could learn a lot from

812
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,600
it but yeah that's that's my current

813
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:59,279
stance on it

814
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:01,520
especially for the expectations that

815
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:04,159
there are today of just a full-fledged

816
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:04,799
uh friendly experience i'd say discourse

817
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:07,760
is a

818
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:07,760
better choice to start

819
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:15,840
seeing the hand up there don't really

820
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,840
want to throw this

821
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:22,320
hi um it's just in regards to um dealing

822
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,360
with actually setting up all these

823
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:26,559
channels and

824
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:29,439
form of communication as a

825
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:29,918
community manager for example how would

826
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:33,200
you

827
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:34,720
install perhaps unique code of conduct

828
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,320
for each of these channels or would it

829
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:38,320
be a blanket

830
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:40,000
all channels how you interact with each

831
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:42,720
other so like for example

832
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:45,120
if it was the this synchronous you would

833
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:47,520
have to perhaps say no spamming no

834
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:48,559
doing x y and z great that kind of

835
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:50,799
aspect

836
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:51,678
yeah absolutely so i'm hearing the the

837
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:54,000
question is

838
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:55,440
that like do you have a per channel code

839
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,799
of conduct and per channel

840
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,799
channel documentation or is it

841
00:25:56,799 --> 00:26:01,200
centralized firm believer you have to

842
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:03,600
have one url to rule them all

843
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:05,120
that's kind of a different conversation

844
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,799
but like by default like

845
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:09,600
your documentation should lead to one

846
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:10,080
place and give as brief an overview as

847
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,879
possible

848
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:14,879
and then link to other things so i think

849
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:16,000
a default code of conduct for across the

850
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,840
spectrum because that's

851
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,679
you're all still participating in one

852
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,480
community across the channels is really

853
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:22,480
important

854
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:24,240
um and then yes there may be some

855
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,799
specific nuance like how to what's our

856
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:27,200
reticule

857
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:30,720
versus how we use discourse and those

858
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,720
instructions can be in those different

859
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,840
channels

860
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,840
you
