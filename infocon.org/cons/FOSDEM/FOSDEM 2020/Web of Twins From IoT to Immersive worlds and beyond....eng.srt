1
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:09,519
for joining this presentation

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,639
and i will try to share a concept about

3
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:12,160
what i call this

4
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:14,480
web of twins so it's more an

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:17,680
experimentation than a

6
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:20,720
established project so first who am i

7
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,680
so i'm a software engineer and i've been

8
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:24,479
a long time

9
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,279
software free open source software user

10
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,080
and i

11
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:28,880
started to contribute like 20 years ago

12
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,679
now

13
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:34,000
and i was uh i had the opportunity to

14
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:35,920
join uh some industry and open source

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,640
project like tizen i

16
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,239
was doing um some contribution for intel

17
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,200
at the time and then i moved to samsung

18
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:46,078
to work more on iot

19
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:48,399
and uh currently i'm open for any kind

20
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,200
of cooperation of sponsorship or i have

21
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:52,239
to think about

22
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:55,600
what can i am to do in the future

23
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:57,519
but anyway first let me just

24
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,039
introduce the concept of what is a

25
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,440
digital twin so

26
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:02,879
in the year 2000 when i was a student i

27
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:06,239
hacked something

28
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:06,239
which was very close to this

29
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,919
concept but i didn't know it so i made

30
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:12,159
some kind of

31
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,159
puppets you are you have in 3d in the

32
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:16,080
vrml in the browser and i was

33
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,920
working with people perpetrators without

34
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,960
some kind of sensor and we are trying to

35
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:22,720
animate the

36
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:25,039
the puppet over the web so it was a

37
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,560
nice demonstration there was no real

38
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,799
market for this

39
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,640
but it was possible at that time but it

40
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,560
was not using any open source

41
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,479
thing so now is the thing that changed

42
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:37,759
and i will explain why

43
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:41,119
so the concept itself is has been

44
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:42,720
well promoted by the researcher from

45
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:44,240
florida institute of technology and he

46
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:47,280
described as a digital

47
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:50,079
replica of a physical entity

48
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,840
and the specification the specific

49
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:53,759
surface that the bolts are somehow

50
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:57,280
connected so if you move

51
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:59,920
the 3d model for instance it will have

52
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,560
an effect on the real-world object and

53
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,399
the same

54
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:08,319
in the opposite way so from this you can

55
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:11,120
have some kind of um a

56
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:13,040
new service to to design applications so

57
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,760
you can do some simulation of course you

58
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,640
can

59
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:19,040
use this at the design stage of the

60
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:21,040
product or for the device you are

61
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,959
trying to consider and you can try to

62
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,840
think about what kind of api

63
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:28,160
this thing can be can share to the

64
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:30,000
others and trying to

65
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,359
establish new services even if you don't

66
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,599
have the product so it's

67
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,560
a part of the product life management

68
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:37,359
and uh

69
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:39,040
it's quite interesting because it can

70
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,440
when sometimes you have some delay

71
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,160
due to production of sourcing you can

72
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,120
work on

73
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,599
let's say the poor version of the device

74
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,040
of

75
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:51,599
the thing you want to work with and

76
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,799
it's quite popular now in the industry

77
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:54,720
when people want to

78
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,640
do some simulation of a production line

79
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,840
and so on instead of building the world

80
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,040
things you can try to get some

81
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,959
simulation and see

82
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:04,239
how it behaves and if you are

83
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:05,519
configuring or alterating a bit you can

84
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:07,840
get some early feedback

85
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:09,519
without any cost and then cities also is

86
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:12,640
a in the

87
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:15,599
domain that can be useful yeah

88
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,238
so before going on i want to and find

89
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:19,679
some

90
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:23,280
ethical consideration because uh

91
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:25,360
large-scale deployment of digital twins

92
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,560
can be problematic yeah we

93
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:31,519
we have now a lot of many issues

94
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,159
social media private information private

95
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:35,360
communication

96
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:37,359
and so on so if we do if we start

97
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,640
trying to do to duplicate the world in

98
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,680
the digital world

99
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:43,518
maybe we'll try to have some ethical

100
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,040
consideration from the beginnings also

101
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:48,080
don't wait for problem to

102
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:49,760
find solution maybe you just need to

103
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,360
design your system and trying to avoid

104
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:54,079
problems so

105
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:56,080
one thing interesting recently is that

106
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:58,159
european regulation

107
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,519
has a recommendation a strong

108
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:01,840
recommendation for

109
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,720
system designer to handle privacy by

110
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,159
design

111
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:08,319
and by default so i believe that

112
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:10,560
it's an opportunity not to miss from

113
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:13,119
open source communities because

114
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,959
privacy is part of our dna we are

115
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:18,239
somehow users so we know

116
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:21,199
that everything should remain private

117
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:23,599
when it's possible so we i think it's

118
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:26,840
something where we can

119
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:28,400
give us answers to this kind of future

120
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:32,159
problem so

121
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:34,960
now let's talk about uh the web

122
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,160
it's a design for interoperability so

123
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,799
that's for sure

124
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,240
and it uh it was it's a huge um

125
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,639
achievement because today

126
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,440
we are still able to browse this website

127
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:46,479
that'd been

128
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:47,440
designed maybe 20 or 25 years ago and

129
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:50,639
it's transversal

130
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:54,560
you can connect everything to the web so

131
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:54,960
that's the base to do something it has

132
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,800
now

133
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,000
really good 3d support it was not the

134
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,000
case when i made this

135
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
puppet we had you need to add some kind

136
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,440
of plugins and so on it was

137
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,759
a bit boiler plate now you have a webgl

138
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:09,120
inside the browser this means you have a

139
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:11,039
good performance because it's working

140
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:14,160
directly on the gpu

141
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:16,159
so making games in a browser is totally

142
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:21,360
flexible

143
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:21,360
and yeah privacy is one of the

144
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,560
features of the browser so you have some

145
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,240
kind of process

146
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,759
in isolation in the browser so that's

147
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,720
something interesting for the previous

148
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:32,240
slide

149
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:35,080
and the next people in a iot

150
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:37,360
and specifically the double v3c we are

151
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:40,960
specifying protocol and so on

152
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,960
they propose some

153
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:46,960
some recommendation to design iot system

154
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:49,039
without reinventing the wheel but by

155
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,719
adjusting existing standards so we have

156
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:53,919
like http

157
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:55,280
json json ld and websocket and those

158
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:58,639
kind of

159
00:05:55,280 --> 00:06:03,119
technologies still apply to iot

160
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:06,960
and mozilla made an implementation of

161
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:09,360
web of things concept and the selling

162
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,719
point of this project is making a home

163
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:14,319
platform

164
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:15,680
a smartphone platform to give users the

165
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:18,319
control of their device

166
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:20,319
so they are handling privacy from the

167
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:23,440
beginning of the project

168
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:24,639
so device and gateway are working

169
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:29,039
together into

170
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:32,400
user network so there is no leak cage

171
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:32,400
possible no

172
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:38,720
that are logging and so on so the

173
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:39,440
the software itself is providing some ui

174
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,560
to control

175
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,800
all those things to connect them

176
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:46,720
together to establish some

177
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:48,880
behavior and also you have

178
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:51,680
extra features that you can connect to

179
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:53,759
your home gateway remotely

180
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,039
share some resource one by one if you

181
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:57,520
select to share

182
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:59,680
let's say a door to some members of your

183
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,599
family you can do this

184
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,199
and it has been designed to be flexible

185
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:05,759
and to be

186
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:07,520
support new plugins and new features so

187
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:11,039
that's the platform i've been uh

188
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:13,758
working on so

189
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:15,599
the web things now are dumb devices are

190
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:16,000
connected to the gateway but they are

191
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:18,090
using

192
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,599
a basic http

193
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:22,799
[Music]

194
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:24,719
protocol so it's based on rest and

195
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,400
they are describing all the resource

196
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:30,240
using a mozilla schema

197
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:33,039
it's a simplified version of what

198
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,240
the w3c is doing but basically the same

199
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:36,479
set of properties

200
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,360
to describe the thing is that the on

201
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:39,599
button i can

202
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,720
turn it on and off some level if i want

203
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:44,000
to adjust the volume

204
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:46,080
of the lamp of whatever and some action

205
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,199
if you want to give instruction to your

206
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:50,639
device like

207
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:53,440
okay fade the brightness of your lamp

208
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:53,759
slowly and then turn it off for instance

209
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:57,919
and

210
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:58,400
also receive some events from device so

211
00:07:57,919 --> 00:07:59,758
but

212
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,159
if you want to implement simple things

213
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:04,400
you can just focus on properties

214
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,759
so security is handled by the gateway so

215
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,599
this means uh

216
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:09,840
if you want to share the outside this

217
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:14,878
gateway

218
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:17,359
is a ex giving some rest api with

219
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:19,360
tokens so you don't have direct access

220
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:23,759
to the device you need to get

221
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:23,759
identified somehow and

222
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:28,159
yeah that's it so for instance i made a

223
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,639
very

224
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,759
minimalist example i call it a smart

225
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:33,680
home example but

226
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:35,599
actually it has only one thing inside

227
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:37,838
this is just a solar

228
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:39,360
panel on the top so it's just a

229
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:42,399
simulator

230
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:46,240
so you can try it it's open source

231
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:49,120
and what you see on this

232
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:51,200
description you have some id to identify

233
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:53,600
and the properties as i just mentioned

234
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,959
and a link for each properties and then

235
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,200
you can put some

236
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:58,239
you can get the value or put the value

237
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:02,240
using

238
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:05,279
a get or post request it

239
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:08,560
was straightforward

240
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:11,600
so now if we want to

241
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:12,399
to address the problem of visualizing

242
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,279
the things

243
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:15,839
so i just mentioned about the webgl for

244
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:18,720
g

245
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:20,560
for the accelerated graphics and now

246
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,399
lately we have a new specification

247
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:25,599
called web xr

248
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:29,040
which is an evolution of webvr we

249
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:30,959
used to have a couple of years ago was

250
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,240
i think this is what it was showing just

251
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:35,760
before and

252
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:38,720
now it's more unified and it's important

253
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:41,680
augmented reality use case

254
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:43,040
and to do some application you can use

255
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:46,319
the a-frame framework

256
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:47,279
which is very very simple so 3d is not

257
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,480
something

258
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:50,880
it used to be something really

259
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:53,120
complicated but now you can do this as

260
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,480
easy as writing an html page in

261
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:57,600
javascript so this is a

262
00:09:54,480 --> 00:10:01,040
here is a basic one you just import the

263
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:02,640
library and describe a structure of

264
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,319
different elements and you can bind with

265
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:08,959
this so here is a sphere

266
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:10,640
on the on inside it so

267
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:13,279
so then something interesting is the

268
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:15,920
gtlf format so it's a format

269
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,480
made for delivering 3d content to the

270
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,640
web

271
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:21,440
it has been proposed by the kronos group

272
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:25,439
who was in charge of opengl and

273
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:27,680
other 3d 3d formats and

274
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,040
it's basically it's just a structure in

275
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:32,399
json describing the

276
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:34,719
same graph of each element of the

277
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:37,040
of the content and it's already

278
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,760
supported in a blender 3d so that's

279
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,880
really interesting

280
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,439
because if you have to work with

281
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:43,760
designer probably they will not

282
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,800
describe all their world by writing

283
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:48,880
html5

284
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:52,560
html a-frame tags they will use a tool

285
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:55,760
so here is an example with

286
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:58,160
this gtlf output so what you see in the

287
00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:01,120
background maybe it's a bit dark but

288
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:02,719
there is a blinking uh piece on the on

289
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:06,000
the roof on the right

290
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,800
which is simulating the value of the my

291
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
solar

292
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:12,000
panel so if there is a lot of sun

293
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,200
you get a higher value and you can

294
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,920
simulate this

295
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,560
and what i'm showing in this example is

296
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:19,599
that you have

297
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:22,160
direct bindings between the description

298
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,959
from the web thing so the physical thing

299
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:26,719
that's really

300
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:29,439
the the actual device and

301
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,399
the same description is aligned to the

302
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,120
gtlf

303
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:35,120
format so if i'm here what i'm doing in

304
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,959
this

305
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,640
i'm just updating the the value so if

306
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:41,599
the value move physically

307
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:42,640
like from a sensor it will access to the

308
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,200
dom tree of the

309
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:47,760
web of the webpage and change some

310
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,760
attributes

311
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:52,399
now if you want to do something more

312
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:56,560
physical so something real

313
00:11:52,399 --> 00:12:00,079
uh i made a diy

314
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:03,199
uh smart arm of this size so it's

315
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:05,279
like a toy and i really i made a my

316
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:07,839
solar panel with a

317
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:08,639
with uh you know the garden numb you can

318
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:10,639
find

319
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:12,959
for super cheap in the outside you can

320
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:16,720
you just plug this directly to a

321
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:19,760
microcontroller or both and you get some

322
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:21,920
basics of what a smart

323
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:23,279
um with a solar panel would work and

324
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,959
it's running on javascript on the

325
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:28,560
microcontroller

326
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:31,359
so you can then expose all the resources

327
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:32,959
using the websing api for iotgs which is

328
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:36,480
a

329
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:40,479
tiny javascript runtime made

330
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:42,639
for for low-end gpg microcontroller

331
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,720
and also i made also module for dealing

332
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:46,880
with sensors

333
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:49,040
so here is demonstration but i can try

334
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:53,279
to make a live demo

335
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:56,120
so um

336
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:57,439
i'm just reloading

337
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:59,040
[Music]

338
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:01,360
connectivity is not that fast i'm not

339
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:03,599
sure it will work but

340
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,800
okay so what you see here on the corner

341
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,800
here is a

342
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,639
camera i have on top of my desk and

343
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:10,959
there is a small robot

344
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:10,959
here

345
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:22,880
so i can control different

346
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:26,880
units so here is a light for instance

347
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:26,880
so i can change the value

348
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:32,399
and the robot here is described from

349
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,399
so it's just a set of motor and you can

350
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:35,680
adjust different angles so let me show

351
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:39,760
you

352
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:39,760
it's running in the right time so

353
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:47,119
so what you see in uh in the top is the

354
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:50,000
actual thing and the

355
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,600
blow is a virtual one made with a frame

356
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,519
it's not a one-to-one

357
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,440
model it's it's not the same because i

358
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:58,720
made it by my own

359
00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:00,240
and i found that it can be a bit

360
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,440
challenging to have exactly the same

361
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,079
system because if there is some

362
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,959
mechanical

363
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:07,599
instruction oh here i'm showing some the

364
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:10,000
rule system when you can

365
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:13,600
change the attributes of the physical

366
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,600
things depending on some context

367
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:19,600
and so so

368
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:21,439
there is the same rule in the opposite

369
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,320
direction so when i'm pressing on the on

370
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:25,120
button

371
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:31,839
it will move forward and if i'm turning

372
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:31,839
it off it will go backwards

373
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,920
so as you can see it's updated in the

374
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:38,880
same time it's not there is no smooth

375
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:42,319
animation oh yeah i put a sensor in uh

376
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:43,519
on the head of my uh of my robot and i'm

377
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,079
measuring uh

378
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:46,560
the color of what i see here in front of

379
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:48,079
me

380
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,599
so if i change the color of the light

381
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:52,079
here it's updated in a

382
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,079
sensor

383
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:59,760
so this is a one use case also i made a

384
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:01,360
3d version of my dashboard so this is

385
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:04,160
not the actual thing this is just

386
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:06,240
abstract widgets in 3d and it below it

387
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:09,680
can interact exactly the same so

388
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:10,079
you can be in a some kind of immersive

389
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,839
world

390
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:13,120
and interact with it and it has the same

391
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:16,320
effect in reality

392
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:18,880
so maybe it can be useless for many um

393
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,600
many cases but uh if you are considering

394
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,439
you are

395
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,040
you have a robot somewhere on some

396
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,800
planet in a in space

397
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,800
and you want to control it it's more

398
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:28,800
maybe from endless in an

399
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:31,199
environment which is immersive it's

400
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:32,079
better but more realistically when you

401
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:34,240
have

402
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:35,519
very small mechanical parts that fit in

403
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:38,959
a very very

404
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:40,800
restricted uh space

405
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:42,560
having the ability to scale it to larger

406
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,439
level and to see and look around how

407
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:46,800
does it behave

408
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:48,720
can be also something interesting here

409
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:50,079
i think i have another demonstration

410
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:54,079
here here

411
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:56,399
oh yeah this one is about using sensor

412
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:58,800
oh but maybe i handle more questions

413
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:58,800
later

414
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:04,240
so yeah so what i have on the screen is

415
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,920
a

416
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:08,480
it's a 3d scene which is just a light

417
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,560
bulb

418
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:13,759
it's updating accordingly to what the

419
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,758
sensor is showing

420
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:22,000
so it worked in a browser and browsers

421
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:25,120
now are working

422
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,720
in uh vr ad sets so you can

423
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,880
you have done you don't need to create a

424
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,800
specific application you can

425
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:32,240
have something uh so sorry for the

426
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:35,040
quality of this video but

427
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:37,199
what i wanted to show is that uh i can

428
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,079
make also standalone application here i

429
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:40,639
made a link and

430
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:41,439
if you look at what i'm clicking this is

431
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:44,000
address

432
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:45,519
of my web sync so i can get direct

433
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,880
access to the

434
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:49,440
to the sensor and then it will update it

435
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,480
in my

436
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:54,399
3d view so it's not it's vr now

437
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:57,839
i think yeah we made a version with the

438
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:57,839
ar at the same time

439
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:04,160
so yeah the application is portable you

440
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:07,280
don't need to deploy to store

441
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,839
you don't need to to to under a specific

442
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:10,160
sdk

443
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:12,399
that's the promise of the webware but

444
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:15,280
that's the theory because in practice

445
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:17,039
most of uh vr vendors i'm using

446
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:20,160
extinction and so

447
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:22,879
so yeah here i'm controlling uh

448
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:25,360
some led and all the widgets i'm having

449
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:28,960
action on now updated in a

450
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:33,918
in the vr world also so what am i doing

451
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:33,919
here is okay turning on uh

452
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:39,120
a fan yeah it's off

453
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:44,000
and i think yeah i have also a smart

454
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:47,600
outlet

455
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:50,000
um there is a switch so

456
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,000
i can

457
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:56,559
so it's the same switch we have in the

458
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:58,240
dashboard can be also integrated for the

459
00:17:56,559 --> 00:18:00,399
3d world and it's having effect in the

460
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:03,360
same time

461
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,360
so yeah

462
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,959
so the beauty of this demonstration is

463
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:10,160
that

464
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:12,000
i use the mozilla scam schemas and it's

465
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:13,200
generic enough to describe all kinds of

466
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,600
things you don't need to have

467
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:17,840
to do something specific if you have to

468
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:21,840
deal with boolean numbers and so on

469
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:29,840
it will work for a wide range of devices

470
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:29,840
so yeah the same in 3d here

471
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:33,280
so yeah if there is any question i will

472
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:42,559
be happy to

473
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:44,320
give any hints on

474
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:45,760
so i'm sure they'll be questions because

475
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:47,840
not everything was

476
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:50,400
self-evident especially when you

477
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:53,760
discover all the possibilities so

478
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,760
let's start with the first question

479
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:58,399
rather

480
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,960
by the way you forgot your laptops here

481
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,960
you say okay

482
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:08,840
i think yeah uh oh there's another

483
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:10,640
demonstration i can show it's only a

484
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:13,760
minute

485
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:16,240
so yeah i made this robot and uh so

486
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:17,360
first i made a web thing of just the

487
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,200
motor

488
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:21,760
a servo motor where i can adjust the

489
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:25,280
angles and it i was updating uh

490
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:28,320
uh airframe so as soon as i had this uh

491
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:30,720
working it was straightforward to to

492
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:33,600
animate a tree a real robot with a four

493
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:35,760
motors it's twofox1 it works for force

494
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:38,959
so here is a 3d version of it where you

495
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:42,160
can look around it as i said previously

496
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:45,360
so anyway it's a proof of concept so far

497
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:46,400
i made it very modular so if you want to

498
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,559
build things you can

499
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:50,880
just pick some specific components and

500
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:52,799
you can build something else

501
00:19:50,880 --> 00:20:06,240
and here is a pencil so i need to share

502
00:19:52,799 --> 00:20:09,200
you the links

503
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,200
okay i'll uh

504
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:16,240
i was just wondering uh um

505
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:16,719
which part was the the most challenging

506
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:21,280
one

507
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:23,440
the most challenging part of the project

508
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:25,039
okay thanks so you said what was the

509
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:27,760
most challenging part of this

510
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:27,760
yes okay

511
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,039
i would say that

512
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:39,120
uh to identify the world person to to

513
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:39,600
introduce me to this kind of technology

514
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,479
so

515
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:43,678
this story started actually one year ago

516
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:47,520
in this room

517
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:48,000
when we met together and uh we had some

518
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,240
kind of

519
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,919
a different approach of something common

520
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:54,880
and uh we met again

521
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:55,600
in uh my own city rain in france and we

522
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,520
started

523
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,879
to act together something and then and

524
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:01,918
in the lesson in the day we

525
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:03,360
we we established the both way direction

526
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:07,679
from sensor to

527
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:10,479
really to to 3d and back and forth

528
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:11,760
so that's we got pretty fast results

529
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:15,760
that's for sure

530
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:18,080
and to answer the question um

531
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:19,679
no major difficulties but when you are

532
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:22,960
dealing with iot device

533
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:25,679
it's not very reliable for instance so

534
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:27,600
this robot is made for it's like a toy

535
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:30,720
actually you can buy it for

536
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:31,678
a couple of euros and sometimes it gets

537
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,760
stuck and so on

538
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:34,720
but uh for prototyping it's not a

539
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,320
problem it's not something you're

540
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:38,640
running in production

541
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:40,480
so if you want to build something real

542
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:42,960
like physical device

543
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,520
yeah reliability of the device is uh

544
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,960
it's just

545
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:50,080
it's a full-time job here here it's a

546
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:50,080
research environment project

547
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:58,240
do you have any plans to use um other

548
00:21:55,679 --> 00:22:00,240
robots that are low cost robots but

549
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:02,400
a little bit you know better than yeah

550
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:05,200
yeah

551
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:06,320
yeah so the question is uh if i have any

552
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:09,360
plans to use a

553
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:12,399
different range of robots uh i'm not

554
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:13,360
specifically a geek of robots i i wanted

555
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:16,480
to make athletes

556
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:18,479
once but i figured out that the robotic

557
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:20,159
community now in open source is quite

558
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:22,640
interesting now they are making a lot of

559
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:25,760
open hardware devices you can get

560
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:26,799
but yeah does it worth the investment

561
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:29,039
month for me

562
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:31,200
not specifically but if there is a

563
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:33,200
source project if they are looking a

564
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:35,520
software stack to use that probably uh

565
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,799
yeah i will be more than happy for them

566
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:39,200
to use this yeah

567
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:41,120
but again if you go into robotics

568
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,559
probably javascript is not the best

569
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:45,199
option here

570
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:46,480
because you have a lot of hard real-time

571
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,919
constraints

572
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,919
so i'm not sure it's part of the

573
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:51,760
standard yet so

574
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:55,280
the most important platform for instance

575
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:57,840
is robs the robotic operating system

576
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:58,879
but for here it's not very it's not

577
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:01,760
critical because it's

578
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:02,480
just an arm is not going to to to break

579
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:05,600
anything

580
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:06,720
but if you are making like a rc car or

581
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:11,360
something like this yeah

582
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:11,360
if you break too late you can destroy it

583
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:19,600
okay can you clarify

584
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:22,960
the purpose of each tools you

585
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:27,520
use like i don't understand what

586
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:30,799
your samsung tools does and what the

587
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:32,799
tools okay so

588
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:35,039
let's start from the lower level so

589
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:39,679
first we need a hardware platform

590
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:41,279
okay the question is what is uh

591
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:43,440
where are these the tools are

592
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:45,520
interacting each between each other and

593
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:47,520
uh

594
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,639
what is specific to mozilla and other

595
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:52,799
components

596
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:55,520
so once you have this hardware uh

597
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:57,760
setup you need to implement the re this

598
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:59,120
mozilla rest api so it's a

599
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:01,200
it's not a software it's mostly a

600
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:02,479
protocol so you can do in any tools you

601
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:06,240
want

602
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:09,360
for me i made uh i ported the node.js

603
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:13,440
library to iot gs which is a

604
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:16,479
javascript runtime from samsung so yeah

605
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:19,679
i'm in this case i am in bose world

606
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:22,080
and then once you have this uh

607
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:24,400
rest api from the thing yeah you need to

608
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:27,039
connect to the gateway for sure

609
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:28,559
and then if you want to get access to

610
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:30,400
the thing directly if you want to do it

611
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:31,840
properly you need

612
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,679
to share the resource through the

613
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:35,279
gateway to another device that will

614
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:38,320
understand the

615
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:40,799
the rest api so

616
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:41,840
this api can be implemented in any any

617
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:45,360
different

618
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:46,559
languages so i made my javascript code

619
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,959
is just a client

620
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:51,039
and then from the rendering i reuse

621
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:53,120
another project which was uh initiated

622
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:55,200
by mozilla but they're not

623
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:57,520
it's not it's now us living by sounds

624
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:59,520
which is the a-frame framework

625
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:01,279
and this framework is based on the

626
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:04,000
standard i mentioned about

627
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:04,640
web xr which is standardized by another

628
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,120
group

629
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:08,320
so the full chain is a different pieces

630
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:11,678
of open source

631
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:13,678
each is smoothly working together

632
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:15,440
because

633
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:17,120
they are aligned to us fixed

634
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:20,320
specifications so

635
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:22,158
doing some quick and dirty acts is

636
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:25,360
something interesting but uh

637
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:26,960
to achieve some cooperation and

638
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:28,479
you are if you don't want to lose time

639
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:30,799
to do some bridge

640
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:32,320
from one technology to another it's

641
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:36,320
better to start to use the same

642
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:36,320
all the longer or the chain

643
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:45,840
nobody is speaking after so i can stay

644
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:49,279
here for the one one year

645
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:49,279
no no that's our school

646
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:59,120
what are what are the what's the ideal

647
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,960
contribution you would get on those

648
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:03,918
repositories

649
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,919
something unexpected

650
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:08,799
it's good because we have a creative

651
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,799
crowd

652
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:12,480
now something i think that could be

653
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:15,679
interesting is to um

654
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:18,400
to geo localize uh different objects

655
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:19,679
and uh having them working together so

656
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:22,320
maybe

657
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:24,159
either at a human level or maybe

658
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:27,678
something bigger like a

659
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:29,360
city let's say uh videos in

660
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:31,360
traffic jumps and so on in real time

661
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:32,559
that's something that can be can be nice

662
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:34,639
to see

663
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:36,320
but yeah no i have not no specific ideas

664
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:38,880
um i just wanted to

665
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:41,360
to validate that this can be done so

666
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:44,559
then it can apply to many use cases

667
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:47,840
yeah if you have some some hints about

668
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:47,840
how do you

669
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:51,199
create a web framework that interacts

670
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,960
with

671
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:55,200
in real time with a lot of different

672
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:57,039
sources that can be interesting because

673
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:59,120
if you here it's easy because i have

674
00:26:57,039 --> 00:27:01,840
only one device and

675
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:04,000
maybe a couple of dozen but if i want to

676
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:06,799
scale to maybe a thousand

677
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,919
maybe it's not the best uh way to do it

678
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:11,360
so i have to

679
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:13,200
maybe use a different protocol here i

680
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:17,918
know that there is some streamer

681
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:21,840
streamable like time series and so on so

682
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:21,840
maybe something i should look at

683
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:28,669
