1
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:11,489
because after this yeah starting over I

2
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:13,590
forget you and you the microphone so

3
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:27,509
yeah hurry up adventure game framework

4
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:30,810
in there Godot let's do that again does

5
00:00:27,509 --> 00:00:34,739
this work yeah okay so starting over

6
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:38,250
from from scratch this this adventure

7
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:39,780
for a game framework on Android oh so

8
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:43,440
adventure games and Anatomy

9
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:45,360
at first we will I will focus on what's

10
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,430
adventure adventure adventure game

11
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,780
creators actually need what do they

12
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:54,930
require in order to create the again and

13
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:56,910
what do they actually don't want when

14
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:59,760
they are focusing on creating the game

15
00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:02,059
itself then I'll talk more about is

16
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:06,030
Korea introduce it a little bit more

17
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:08,189
talk about its current status and what

18
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:12,689
we what we can do to make it actually

19
00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:15,148
actually better and complete so what's

20
00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:18,240
another adventure game basically a few

21
00:01:15,149 --> 00:01:19,859
elements that you will find in every in

22
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:23,579
every adventure game point-and-click

23
00:01:19,859 --> 00:01:25,530
adventure games of course well there

24
00:01:23,579 --> 00:01:28,678
there were a lot of adventure games in

25
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:34,049
the history so mostly focus on those you

26
00:01:28,679 --> 00:01:36,420
can you can see here most of the time

27
00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:38,789
you will be playing in an animated

28
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:42,210
character the main player that can move

29
00:01:38,789 --> 00:01:46,079
around and over scene change go from

30
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:49,619
room to room etc so basically walks you

31
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:52,798
can find also items NPCs to talk with

32
00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:55,380
those NPCs are of course we are reacting

33
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:59,630
to actions action that's and that you

34
00:01:55,380 --> 00:02:02,219
can find here on certain you eyes

35
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:04,439
sometimes uncertain your eyes you won't

36
00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:07,520
find them depends depending on the game

37
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:11,250
you will find them under the right click

38
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:14,220
to change the actual action to perform

39
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:17,330
on the on the game objects such as

40
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:20,340
talking give up use give etcetera

41
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:23,670
other elements that you will find in

42
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:27,300
almost every adventure games mostly 2d

43
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:29,160
of course here puzzles using the using

44
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:33,540
all the items that you will be able to

45
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:35,579
find in in the rooms which means of

46
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:37,980
course having an innovate inventory to

47
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:39,600
keep all these items into into your

48
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:42,359
pockets which is funny because usually

49
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:45,720
your pockets are that big and you could

50
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:47,640
put a whole ship into it

51
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:51,270
dialogues of course as I said you will

52
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:54,690
meet a lot of a lot of people NPCs to

53
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:58,440
talk with into your into the games in

54
00:02:54,690 --> 00:03:03,030
order to follow the whole history which

55
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:05,520
is interesting and it's totally part of

56
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:08,610
the story that you want to that you want

57
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:11,870
to tell the player and also in are also

58
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:15,960
in order to tell a story you'll need

59
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:19,650
cutscenes that reward the player when as

60
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:22,020
he advances the story of the game that's

61
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:28,170
what the player is looking for when when

62
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:31,530
he advances the game so first of all we

63
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:34,589
are talking video games here and it is

64
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:38,120
mostly commonly accepted that video

65
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:41,220
games are no kind of an artistic thing

66
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:43,290
so we are talking with art we are

67
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:45,420
working with artists here what do

68
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:47,850
artists actually need to work on video

69
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:49,850
games like this first of all they again

70
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:53,120
need they need to be responsible of the

71
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:56,510
lifetime of the FLDS sets we are

72
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:59,220
actually creating for a further game

73
00:03:56,510 --> 00:04:02,130
from the beginning from the black canvas

74
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:05,040
to the sprite that will be in the actual

75
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:07,620
game they need no dependency on the

76
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:10,829
programmers they just want to draw their

77
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:13,380
art put it in the game and don't ask any

78
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:16,109
program now sir please can you program

79
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:18,480
update this sprite with the new asset I

80
00:04:16,108 --> 00:04:21,120
just created in the date is again which

81
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:24,690
needs were compiling all the time boring

82
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:29,280
stuff for the for the the artists they

83
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:30,600
just wanted to be in the game and do not

84
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:33,330
require anything

85
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:35,700
and of course that's the the most

86
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:39,000
important thing since they are video

87
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:42,479
game artists their medium is the video

88
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:45,150
game itself of course they will draw all

89
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:47,670
their assets in the dedicated software's

90
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:52,109
such as being such as creators of such

91
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:54,840
as a Photoshop whatever but they will

92
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:58,050
then export them and put them in the

93
00:04:54,840 --> 00:05:00,690
video games directly otherwise it stays

94
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:05,730
on the on their blank page and the

95
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:08,430
European Garrett is now that was for an

96
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:11,250
that was for the game artists now what

97
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:13,830
do you gain designers need the orders

98
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:16,500
are not the same these persons are the

99
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:20,099
one who actually writes this to arrive

100
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:24,420
the story and turn it as scripts that

101
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:27,060
work in the that make the game work as

102
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:29,490
the Java scripts are processed and as

103
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:32,580
the scripts are used according to the

104
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:35,670
actions of the of the player make the

105
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:37,560
game advance change the game state and

106
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:40,950
there are all this kind of stuff

107
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:43,230
so game designers basically create their

108
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:46,349
story by building rooms using the

109
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:49,290
backgrounds from the artists and they

110
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:51,210
put on on this navigable air areas for

111
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:56,330
the play of to know where the player is

112
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:59,880
able to walk or not at spot spot areas

113
00:05:56,330 --> 00:06:02,370
this is more some kind of UI stuff that

114
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:06,810
it can serve the story as well since you

115
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:09,600
want to to be able to to define these

116
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:11,700
areas to be focusable so the player can

117
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:16,110
just look at them but maybe not take

118
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:17,969
them use just use items on it and then

119
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:22,230
that still not take them not push down

120
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:24,630
etc items of course trigger areas

121
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:26,610
sometimes you are in your stories you

122
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:29,100
want to be able to have the player

123
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:32,390
walking in an area and trigger another

124
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:35,400
event and for example started cutting

125
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:38,820
NPCs as well so basically this is

126
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:41,219
accessing the access in and influence

127
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:44,430
the game logic but not too much because

128
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:47,580
if you give the game designer too much

129
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:49,650
freedom then it's it first it would be

130
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:51,599
more difficult to for him because he

131
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:54,200
will have to manage so many things and

132
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:59,670
he wants to focus on the game logic and

133
00:06:54,200 --> 00:07:02,039
only only his story but still complex in

134
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:05,270
us enough to for him to be able to

135
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:10,950
create and write interesting stories and

136
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:13,500
and focus on this so now what do game

137
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:18,659
creators in general don't want to make

138
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:20,460
nest with first of all and I believe

139
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:23,970
that they don't want you to care about

140
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:26,549
the UI you know I mean they need to care

141
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:28,020
about the UI because they want to know

142
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:29,880
what it will look like they want to

143
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:32,430
change the theme they want to know to

144
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:35,670
place it on on the screen that you want

145
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:37,500
to define there it's basic behavior but

146
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:39,120
in an event and in an adventure game you

147
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:41,880
have the inventory you have all the

148
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:46,800
dialogues the verbs actions that you can

149
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:49,350
find on the UI UI but they should be

150
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:52,920
already done and the and the game

151
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:56,340
designer should only define their look

152
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:58,830
not their actual behavior what it does

153
00:07:56,340 --> 00:08:00,359
behind the scenes it's not interesting

154
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:03,090
for him so only defined there are

155
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:05,300
parents eventually special behaviors

156
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:07,979
rest it's too technical

157
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:11,010
so you want to they want to care about

158
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:14,040
how characters actually move movement of

159
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:17,730
the characters is some some kinds that

160
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:21,810
can it's a very specific task to be

161
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:24,540
managed in in the game engine nowadays

162
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:26,910
game engines can can deal with this

163
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:29,100
pretty easily with a lot of techniques

164
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:34,070
you can have path finding staff

165
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:37,110
navigation whatsoever so the easiest

166
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:41,760
manner for the game designer to do this

167
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:46,440
is to just define the areas the Wallkill

168
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:48,960
areas and that's all also the same for

169
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:50,910
the animations that you want to define

170
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:54,660
the animations and forget about them

171
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:56,520
create them name them call them call

172
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:58,050
them by scripts of course but don't

173
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:59,760
manage the

174
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:03,839
the animations are actually started in

175
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:05,790
the in the engine don't manage the their

176
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:08,550
timings this is creating the animation

177
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:10,709
but don't manage that the this between

178
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:13,050
the timing of the animation and the

179
00:09:10,709 --> 00:09:16,140
timing of all the management of all the

180
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:17,819
events of the game and so on there are a

181
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:21,720
lot of stuff like this I didn't talk

182
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:23,880
about sound for example so we are

183
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:27,540
talking about a Godot framework here so

184
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:29,910
good or does doesn't provide the doesn't

185
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:32,219
Godot provided already all the stuff you

186
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:34,350
require to her to do this like sprites

187
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:37,890
animated sprites animation player to do

188
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:40,890
the animations so everything

189
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:43,050
everything's ok GD squid which which

190
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:47,120
allows you to create your spritz spritz

191
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:51,229
yoga your game manage the inputs of the

192
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:53,940
of the player everything is fine but

193
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:56,040
it's already too low level for the

194
00:09:53,940 --> 00:10:00,060
creator's so we need more simplicity and

195
00:09:56,040 --> 00:10:02,910
that's the purpose of face Korea so what

196
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:05,609
is it is Korea this Korea is currently

197
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:08,670
in its current state a set of tool and

198
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:13,170
create mostly script that are built on

199
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:16,800
top of Godot and it they define a basic

200
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:19,829
workflow that means the the switz out

201
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:23,209
here and you will as a game creator we

202
00:10:19,829 --> 00:10:26,729
just have to put them on your nodes and

203
00:10:23,209 --> 00:10:29,550
the end that's all and after that we you

204
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:31,649
will have to use another way to script

205
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:35,219
your game logic it's not to be a tool

206
00:10:31,649 --> 00:10:37,709
for teams artists in one hand game

207
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:39,450
designers in the other hand and it's

208
00:10:37,709 --> 00:10:41,790
been built on tougher on top of it in

209
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:46,829
order to forget about the program nation

210
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:49,800
stuff it's already done for you so it's

211
00:10:46,829 --> 00:10:53,040
a collection of scripts as I said to

212
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:54,930
apply and go to do scenes and note then

213
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:59,399
about the scripting part that allows you

214
00:10:54,930 --> 00:11:01,140
to I actually make your make your action

215
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:04,050
the actions that you will see the

216
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:06,149
dialogues as well this kind of things

217
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:08,609
that you can have here those are the

218
00:11:06,149 --> 00:11:10,960
actions look use this would be a script

219
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:13,240
that you could put on a red bed I

220
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:16,560
- documentary item read that for example

221
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:21,250
so the action look basically makes the

222
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:23,670
player to say oh a nice red dead fine

223
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:28,120
and also on other action if you want to

224
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:30,430
action verb use on this red dead the

225
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:32,590
player would just say something else in

226
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:35,400
the same way you could you will have a

227
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:38,640
lot of commands in there in this

228
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:42,430
scripting language to allow you to add

229
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:44,500
add the object in yerevan inventory use

230
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:48,550
you know the object on another object

231
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:50,740
and manage this using States this is not

232
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:53,560
exactly the purpose of this presentation

233
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:56,170
because that's the that's the way it

234
00:11:53,560 --> 00:12:00,550
works and this is not meant to be

235
00:11:56,170 --> 00:12:02,439
changed it already already works the

236
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:04,540
nice thing about Xperia is that it

237
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:07,320
already cared about all the other stuff

238
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:09,730
ice I said before the games elements are

239
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:11,800
the games elements and the managers

240
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:15,010
everything worse items navigations

241
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:17,370
animations you you can already forget it

242
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:19,660
because it's basically already works

243
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:21,760
just to show you a game that's already

244
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:27,339
using a scoria professional game that

245
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:29,800
was out in 2016 this game is the

246
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:33,640
interactive adventures of the under

247
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:36,040
sound in pizza boy which started

248
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:38,290
development in May 2012

249
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:41,530
it's a classic point-and-click game play

250
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:45,400
basically so it's been it just fits the

251
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:48,730
the purpose of the other framework it

252
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:51,670
was made by only six person then twelve

253
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:53,470
in total so it was it's Korea was

254
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:57,250
actually created during the development

255
00:12:53,470 --> 00:13:00,610
of this this game in particular it was a

256
00:12:57,250 --> 00:13:02,950
Kickstarter and the game was tying to

257
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:06,250
the plate publisher the idea was to

258
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:09,910
release s.korea as free software under

259
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:15,880
MIT license after the game was actually

260
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:19,449
released which it was so that's that's

261
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:22,390
good but that's not enough we we have to

262
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:24,450
know that as Corey I was written already

263
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:26,760
a long time ago it was

264
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:29,670
under Goodwin Jean one point X if I'm

265
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:32,520
not wrong and now go dojo is just

266
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:36,390
version 3.2 seems like two or three days

267
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:39,710
and a lot of things happened between in

268
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:44,370
this period of time a lot of features

269
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:48,930
made their appearance in the Indy engine

270
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:52,620
such as editor plugins and just to name

271
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:55,140
one not only this problem is that s

272
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:57,990
Korea s Korea's maintenance is not very

273
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:59,760
easy because the backend the backend

274
00:13:57,990 --> 00:14:04,350
scripts that make the whole framework

275
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:06,960
work are very big it's a loan it's a

276
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:09,420
whole load of off script and it's not

277
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:11,070
easy for this for someone like me who

278
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:12,719
arrived after the development of this

279
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:16,440
game I wasn't the development the

280
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:19,890
developer of a nor neither historian nor

281
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:22,830
Doug Mendoza game IRA I arrived just

282
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:24,810
after when the the framework was

283
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:30,900
released and it's really difficult to

284
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:33,750
dive into this base of code so actually

285
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:35,610
you can run some music anime animations

286
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:38,280
modify game States but it's made of

287
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:41,460
hacks almost everywhere to just tweak

288
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:44,400
something something that some problems

289
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:47,070
that you can find because of some good

290
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:52,040
old bugs you can have this in labels for

291
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:55,440
example it's very difficult to to to use

292
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:57,599
so we are in in my opinion I need more

293
00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:01,550
flexibility currently if you want to

294
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:04,680
make an actual team Z this is a scene

295
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:06,660
which you would call a room in another

296
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:08,359
tool for example so basically a

297
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:12,689
background with the wall cable array is

298
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:15,600
you have them yeah you have the

299
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:17,700
background here you have the terrain and

300
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,890
the this steering node is actually the

301
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:22,410
wall cable area and all the other

302
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:25,430
elements here are basically sprites

303
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:28,670
other game elements the players here

304
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:30,989
then you put everything in this way but

305
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:32,069
certain elements such as the bedroom at

306
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:36,570
the background in the chair not

307
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:37,939
mandatory and the fact is those names

308
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:40,189
need to be

309
00:15:37,939 --> 00:15:43,159
the right order on the in the century so

310
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:45,319
bad background need needs to be needs to

311
00:15:43,159 --> 00:15:48,409
be in first terrain just after that you

312
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:51,439
need to have this very name this is not

313
00:15:48,409 --> 00:15:53,869
very flexible so this must change in

314
00:15:51,439 --> 00:15:56,569
order to let the the crater make the

315
00:15:53,869 --> 00:16:02,689
thing all the things the way he wants it

316
00:15:56,569 --> 00:16:05,539
to be you know in order to because of

317
00:16:02,689 --> 00:16:08,629
this it's hard to add new features some

318
00:16:05,539 --> 00:16:11,869
new features have have been had added in

319
00:16:08,629 --> 00:16:14,329
in the first few months such as the

320
00:16:11,869 --> 00:16:17,659
shadows under the other characters we're

321
00:16:14,329 --> 00:16:19,368
speaking to these shadows here you can

322
00:16:17,659 --> 00:16:23,089
also have lights in your in your

323
00:16:19,369 --> 00:16:27,649
backgrounds and certain one of our user

324
00:16:23,089 --> 00:16:30,109
was wanted and a feature so that lights

325
00:16:27,649 --> 00:16:32,439
actually had an impact on the shadows

326
00:16:30,109 --> 00:16:34,729
under the under the player usually

327
00:16:32,439 --> 00:16:37,189
shadows are just part of the sprites and

328
00:16:34,729 --> 00:16:40,849
that's all he wanted to he wanted

329
00:16:37,189 --> 00:16:42,858
something to be more more dynamic which

330
00:16:40,849 --> 00:16:44,689
is the which was difficult so we just

331
00:16:42,859 --> 00:16:47,559
had to find some or something but again

332
00:16:44,689 --> 00:16:51,199
this is very happy to me

333
00:16:47,559 --> 00:16:53,348
so what what are my goal in order to

334
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:56,149
evolve this career in its current state

335
00:16:53,349 --> 00:17:00,199
for first of all simplify the usability

336
00:16:56,149 --> 00:17:01,069
it's already very easy to use but you

337
00:17:00,199 --> 00:17:03,169
have to

338
00:17:01,069 --> 00:17:07,099
you basically have to read the manual

339
00:17:03,169 --> 00:17:09,500
and a great manual has already been

340
00:17:07,099 --> 00:17:11,480
written by floss manuals which you can

341
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:14,509
find on the internet for free it was

342
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:15,919
it's a great a great example of a game

343
00:17:14,509 --> 00:17:19,970
of a point and click game that you're

344
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:22,909
able to do with it keep it as simple as

345
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:26,179
possible and maintain in order to appeal

346
00:17:22,909 --> 00:17:28,909
more people to add new features fixed

347
00:17:26,179 --> 00:17:31,519
bugs because there are bugs not only go

348
00:17:28,909 --> 00:17:33,740
do bugs but also ask or headaches but

349
00:17:31,519 --> 00:17:36,830
also of course don't make it a new

350
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:39,950
adventure game a new adventure games to

351
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:42,529
do or visionnaire in the undergrowth in

352
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:45,309
order to make this and the idea is to

353
00:17:42,529 --> 00:17:49,990
make a score yeah and an editor plugin

354
00:17:45,309 --> 00:17:51,770
making this we will enable us to

355
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:54,830
integrate

356
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:57,620
s.korea directly into the editor and

357
00:17:54,830 --> 00:18:00,529
also enable us to create new tools such

358
00:17:57,620 --> 00:18:01,879
as a net and s.korea scripting editor so

359
00:18:00,529 --> 00:18:04,669
you will be able to write your SQL

360
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:06,890
scripts directly into Godot which is not

361
00:18:04,669 --> 00:18:08,929
possible currently and also all sorts of

362
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:14,559
theäôve idea that you can have here for

363
00:18:08,929 --> 00:18:17,480
example for existing user scripts to add

364
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:20,240
new functionality without having to

365
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:22,450
modify to edit the actual courier source

366
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:27,080
code

367
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:30,289
this is s.korea a whole bunch of scripts

368
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:35,289
in one folder named global as you can

369
00:18:30,289 --> 00:18:37,940
imagine this is this is a pain so I

370
00:18:35,289 --> 00:18:44,059
wanted to do more to look more and more

371
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:46,130
like this more more homogeneous folders

372
00:18:44,059 --> 00:18:48,799
basically it's sorting all the source

373
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:51,409
code but it also means reorganize the

374
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:59,120
functions instance into the into the

375
00:18:51,409 --> 00:19:01,429
scripts which is a lot of works this has

376
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:04,010
impacts on the relationships on the

377
00:19:01,429 --> 00:19:08,570
relationship between the user Sindh and

378
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:12,020
this Korea so basically we need to make

379
00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:15,830
them a little bit more smarter and try

380
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:18,440
to guess the guest what what the what

381
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:22,939
the game creator wanted to do when he

382
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:24,380
created his scene I'm trying to go a

383
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:28,520
little bit faster because I take your I

384
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:31,880
took a little too much time but you got

385
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:34,250
to be very simple I want only once they

386
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:37,250
use the user note they're going to the

387
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:40,789
second scenes that the user created to

388
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:43,039
have two tasks only receive user inputs

389
00:19:40,789 --> 00:19:47,179
and I need them to as Korea s Korea

390
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:50,960
manages them does his stuff and gives

391
00:19:47,179 --> 00:19:53,840
back those notes actual actions to

392
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:55,909
perform so just move the note play

393
00:19:53,840 --> 00:20:00,879
animation on the note and that's all I

394
00:19:55,909 --> 00:20:03,649
currently you can see some game logic

395
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:05,360
yeah you can see some game logic inside

396
00:20:03,649 --> 00:20:09,229
though the spirits that

397
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:12,229
that you that are currently in those

398
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:17,840
streets which is not something something

399
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:19,760
we want and to finish like on this the

400
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:22,699
example scenes currently scoria comes

401
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:27,379
with a few examples teens which are

402
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:30,200
crappy actually this is the this is the

403
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:32,960
only one i started something over that

404
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:36,770
yeah we want definitely something

405
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:40,850
different so in order to do it to do

406
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:41,260
this well basically we will make it from

407
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:45,379
scratch

408
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:47,419
this means make multiple dimensions

409
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:50,270
showing different features of the

410
00:20:47,419 --> 00:20:53,360
obvious korea that can be animation in

411
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:57,918
the background one scene side-scrolling

412
00:20:53,360 --> 00:21:01,040
another scene this way the if one room

413
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:03,080
one example room is able to showcase

414
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:05,899
only one feature at the time it's easier

415
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:10,220
further for the users to dive into as

416
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:12,730
korea and use it and of course make it a

417
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:16,370
little bit more beautiful because yeah

418
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:21,559
if if I just if I see this for the first

419
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:24,260
time I'd run away so yeah that's the

420
00:21:21,559 --> 00:21:28,100
basic idea so of course this is a lot of

421
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:30,799
work that's a lot of work and it has

422
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:35,178
just started I should have started this

423
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:38,870
a few time ago but yeah life open-source

424
00:21:35,179 --> 00:21:41,860
it this kind of stuff so there is no

425
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:46,040
working branch yet it will happen soon

426
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:48,590
if you already have used this Korea if

427
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:51,440
you're already using a story guys expect

428
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:53,178
some comparative breakage everywhere

429
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:58,220
because it's it will basically change

430
00:21:53,179 --> 00:22:01,820
completely but in the end this time by

431
00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:03,770
starting from scratch I'm really

432
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:05,480
intrigued are integrating all the

433
00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:09,290
existing source code cleaning it

434
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:12,590
removing all but all hacks portion by

435
00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:15,168
portion and all that you have it working

436
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:18,929
exactly the exact same way as before so

437
00:22:15,169 --> 00:22:22,050
it's transparent but

438
00:22:18,930 --> 00:22:24,300
but it it will be totally changed behind

439
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:28,740
the scenes so of course no estimated

440
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:30,750
date of delivery so so for those of you

441
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:34,640
who are already working Waiting for

442
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:34,640
Godot that's one more things to wait for

443
00:22:34,910 --> 00:22:40,670
so what you can do currently just to

444
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:44,010
finish on this you can drop by on IRC

445
00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:44,520
I'm usually idling on Godot engine

446
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:47,160
s.korea

447
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:50,310
there are some people who who are idling

448
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:53,850
there as well so you can share your

449
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:56,360
ideas and suggestions this is the the

450
00:22:53,850 --> 00:23:01,469
Astoria repository it's on the official

451
00:22:56,360 --> 00:23:05,909
Godot engine account it was related in a

452
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:08,640
certain fashion with Godot and if you

453
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:11,930
have any idea suggestions you can also

454
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:13,320
drop down and find an issue in there

455
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:15,060
that's it

456
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:40,560
thanks for listening if you have any

457
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:43,860
questions yeah so do do we have plans

458
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:46,470
for html5 exports actually this is not

459
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:50,389
exactly related with s.korea itself this

460
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:53,520
is more a good ol question to be honnest

461
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:55,800
there are plans about is HTML if I'm not

462
00:23:53,520 --> 00:24:01,200
wrong we have a paid contributor who's

463
00:23:55,800 --> 00:24:03,510
currently working on web exports I'm not

464
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:08,190
really aware of of the current status of

465
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:11,540
this but this will change this since we

466
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:11,540
have some people working on this

467
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:36,700
yeah so current about this the threads

468
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:39,430
and arrangement in the in the web

469
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:42,790
browsers again the same answer and

470
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:44,290
unfortunately I'm sorry this is not

471
00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:47,740
exactly the purpose of this Korea itself

472
00:24:44,290 --> 00:24:51,580
even though it's of course obviously

473
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:53,680
it's using its using threads but this

474
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:55,360
will have to be tested I I don't know

475
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:57,880
the current status of web exports right

476
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:59,590
now with this Korea nor will go to

477
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:03,100
engine itself because I'm not using it

478
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:06,010
myself yet so I have difficulties to

479
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:08,590
answer your questions but if you drop by

480
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:13,920
at the go-to stands maybe somebody will

481
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:13,919
be more able to answer your question yes

482
00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:33,490
yeah so about the Android compatibility

483
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:35,800
and all the widgets you can use on

484
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:37,920
Android applications that's something I

485
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:42,190
have in mind indeed to make it work with

486
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:46,150
with Android and mobile their devices as

487
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:48,580
well that's that's important because in

488
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:50,620
yeah in my in my opinion indeed that's a

489
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:54,399
platform that's that suits very well

490
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:56,050
these kind of adventure games so yeah

491
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:58,480
that's something I I have in mind and I

492
00:25:56,050 --> 00:25:59,919
will try to work on Android experts as

493
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:04,320
well to make it work

494
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:08,560
