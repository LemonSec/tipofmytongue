1
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,119
hello

2
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,800
my name is christoph de linoxia and

3
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:21,359
today i'm going to talk about

4
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,080
alpha waves which i believe to be the

5
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:25,439
very first

6
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:27,198
3d platform game in history

7
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:28,960
there used to be an entry in the

8
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:31,840
guinness book of record for that game

9
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:34,719
but they dropped the whole section so

10
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:37,440
it's no longer official

11
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:38,559
so the best way to understand a game is

12
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,800
to play it

13
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:44,078
so i'm going to start with a quick demo

14
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:46,239
of what it looked like

15
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:47,280
so you those of you in the room have

16
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:50,160
already seen something

17
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,280
but i'm going to start with the main

18
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,120
menu here

19
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,640
where you can see that you have a one

20
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:57,519
player mode

21
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:59,120
two player mode an emotion which is

22
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:03,120
really a training mode

23
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:06,000
without a time limit some help

24
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:08,000
that we saw running while waiting for

25
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,680
the recording to start

26
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,600
so that that's what it looked like and

27
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,439
this made the

28
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,960
the game a bit easier to understand so

29
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:15,679
what you see on the left is a camera

30
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,839
that spins

31
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,360
and the keys that you have to press in

32
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:22,400
order to achieve the desired

33
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:26,640
effect so let's

34
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:29,040
start by playing the game

35
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,960
so you are this central character here

36
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,200
and i'm going to change

37
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,839
to another one for reasons that will be

38
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:39,280
clear at the end of the talk

39
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:42,079
and basically i can spin around

40
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:44,000
and i can by pressing the action button

41
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:45,919
for instance uh the space bar

42
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,240
i can trigger a sort of reactor at the

43
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,240
back and that makes me move forward

44
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:53,960
and then i can switch to another room

45
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,520
and there are

46
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:57,919
256 rooms which are shown in this map

47
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,920
here

48
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:02,560
so you have some time to discover all of

49
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,520
them so this is both a platform game and

50
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,880
a puzzle game

51
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:08,799
and i and you can save uh along

52
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,318
you know at the beginning to you can

53
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,000
save your game to to make forward

54
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:14,238
progress

55
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,360
uh you have here something that unlocks

56
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:17,200
the key so you see

57
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,520
the thing here around the door in front

58
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,399
of me is a key and that means i can't go

59
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,959
that way

60
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,720
and what i did by uh taking this little

61
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:28,080
thing here is i unlocked

62
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:29,680
a key in some other room and you see

63
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,319
that the little thing that spins around

64
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,760
it

65
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:37,040
is supposed to uh unhelp me

66
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:38,640
or basically be some sort of opponents

67
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,160
and as you go forward in the game that

68
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,480
gets

69
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:44,720
smarter and more annoying as you go

70
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,720
along

71
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,040
okay so that's about it for the one

72
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,959
player mode

73
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:53,200
i'm going to so i made a high school

74
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:53,200
there

75
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,400
and you see that i have a permanent high

76
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,239
score at the top that

77
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,840
i don't think you can play long enough

78
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:11,360
in the game to actually beat that

79
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:12,480
game so the two player mode is an

80
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,800
interesting first

81
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,879
because this was the first time you had

82
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:19,599
this horizontally separated

83
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:21,920
splits so that means you can actually

84
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:25,040
really interact with the other guy

85
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:28,000
um so for instance i'm going to push him

86
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:29,280
over there and you see me arriving there

87
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,319
and so that was fun because you could

88
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,200
basically

89
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:34,958
you know this uh was probably one of the

90
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:37,040
first case of competition

91
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:38,879
in a game where you could really either

92
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:42,560
help each other or

93
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:46,159
or fight one another as you prefer

94
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:49,360
and i'm going to change rules uh

95
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:51,840
to show that this game used uh an

96
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:54,159
interesting feature of the atari st

97
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,439
which was that you could change the

98
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:58,560
palette on the fly

99
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:59,359
with vbl sync and so the game uses that

100
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:03,120
to

101
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:05,439
have a palette per room

102
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,439
oops

103
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,360
so the two players could actually be in

104
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:17,040
different rooms and have different color

105
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,280
palettes in the middle

106
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,320
an interesting trivia fact about this uh

107
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:23,359
particular feature

108
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:25,520
is that it only existed on that rest uh

109
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,919
the amiga and pc versions of the game

110
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,758
had

111
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:29,198
turn by turn two-player game which was

112
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:32,080
much less interesting

113
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:33,520
another interesting trivia is that um

114
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,840
when the first time i tried in this

115
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,359
simulator which is called hatari

116
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:41,198
an interesting open source emulator for

117
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:43,840
all the atari range of computers

118
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:45,600
that feature did not work it actually uh

119
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,239
had very bad results on the color

120
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,960
effects

121
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:52,320
and so i have a two lines fixed in atari

122
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,320
just to make that game work

123
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,719
okay so that's basically the end of my

124
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:58,320
demo for now unless you want me to try

125
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,400
something else but that's basically what

126
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:03,360
that is

127
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,359
so back to the talk

128
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:08,159
so let me first say that this was really

129
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,080
a wonderful time when

130
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,560
when this game was developed uh the game

131
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:16,159
was developed between 98 and 99

132
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:18,160
and released in early 99 and 1990 for

133
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,840
the us

134
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:22,720
so that was the time where 3d games were

135
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,719
really not there yet

136
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:29,120
no that's one okay

137
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,680
so why is it so slow to load the videos

138
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,600
so this

139
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:34,960
is uh the game that was an inspiration

140
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:37,280
for me it was called starglider 2.

141
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,080
uh you can see that as was typical at

142
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,239
the time

143
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,520
there was a limited region for rendering

144
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,840
3d graphics

145
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,599
doing that basically saved a lot of time

146
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:48,880
in cpu

147
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:50,880
usage as was also

148
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:53,520
relatively typical for the time there is

149
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:56,159
a small number of items on screen

150
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:57,919
here you can count five or six the floor

151
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:01,199
is really one item with

152
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:03,919
some smarts on how to colorize it

153
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:07,520
and the interactions in game were

154
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:09,758
typically only remote so you only had

155
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,359
things like missiles etc but you could

156
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:13,520
not really have physics

157
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,280
with other items in the game so these

158
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:18,240
are three areas where

159
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,719
alpha is innovated by having full screen

160
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,120
game

161
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,240
play all the time having many objects on

162
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:25,039
screen

163
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,080
and having um direct interaction with

164
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:27,599
the objects

165
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:30,560
now the there was a limited color

166
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,919
palette uh available on screen for that

167
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:35,199
aries it was 16

168
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:37,840
out of 512. so you had to play with that

169
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:41,360
so no real shadows it was all

170
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:43,359
pre-computed colors another game of that

171
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:46,160
time that i picked up to show it

172
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:48,400
was hover tank which is dubbed on the id

173
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,440
software website as the first 3d game on

174
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,880
a pc

175
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,639
so first of all it's clearly not the

176
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,440
first 3d game by far there were many

177
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:56,000
others before

178
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,560
lights etc alpha waves was released

179
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,880
about

180
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,680
two years before hover tank but also

181
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,800
it's not 3d

182
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:04,720
it's uh it's really 2d uh there is only

183
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,160
one axis of rotation basically

184
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,479
and if you look at the characters they

185
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,880
all look at you uh

186
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:11,520
facing so same thing restricted display

187
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,840
area

188
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:17,599
and um no no no truth

189
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:18,000
3d that being said alpha waves were

190
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:20,639
probably

191
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,520
was in my opinion not the best 3d at the

192
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:23,520
time

193
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:25,120
which is probably something i would give

194
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,880
to falcon

195
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,639
again the 3d array was limited by

196
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,080
default but unlike in other games you

197
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:31,360
could actually go full screen even if it

198
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,280
was slower

199
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:36,080
and there were many many objects by the

200
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,080
standards of the time

201
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:40,960
so that's what full screen looked like

202
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,560
and that's another so you see it was

203
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,440
like five images per second or something

204
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,400
like that when you were

205
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,960
full screen and another interesting

206
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,758
thing

207
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:51,280
was that uh to my knowledge this is one

208
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,039
of the first games that tried to do some

209
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:55,840
accurate shadow projection

210
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:56,560
on the floor uh so i've always did that

211
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:59,198
too but

212
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:01,520
the same tricks the shadows are really

213
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:02,960
not really computed and

214
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,799
you may have seen that they may go

215
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:06,719
outside of the projected area for

216
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:10,160
instance

217
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:11,599
so how does alpha wave fit in video game

218
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:14,639
history

219
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:16,240
so this is the first platform game with

220
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:18,240
3d in it

221
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,080
and in my opinion this is also the first

222
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,039
time there was real interactive 3d in

223
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,800
the sense that you could touch

224
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:24,960
practically anything that was around

225
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,000
around you so this is what the wikipedia

226
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:29,359
page has to say about

227
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,520
it but how did they

228
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,640
you know did the it come come about so

229
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,919
you see that i mean

230
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:37,199
i changed uh the the character when i

231
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:38,718
started playing the game

232
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,959
there is another reason i like show at

233
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:42,640
the end but it was to show you something

234
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:43,760
that was the closest to what i had in

235
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:46,080
mind initially

236
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:47,279
which was i was thinking of smurfs

237
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,600
jumping in a room

238
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:51,279
so you know the the smurfs coming book

239
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,800
french people probably know about it so

240
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:55,040
they are very tiny blue characters like

241
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,079
this and and they when they have to go

242
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:59,279
about a table they hop

243
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:01,279
over it and so initially i wanted to do

244
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:03,200
uh a sort of advantage smurf-based

245
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:07,040
adventure game that's

246
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,040
we are far far away from it but

247
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:11,760
okay so let's start with the influence

248
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,880
of star glider so when i saw that my

249
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:16,240
first reaction was

250
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:18,320
wow how do they do that right

251
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,880
it was really the first time we saw this

252
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:22,560
kind of polygons on an st

253
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:24,720
and then my next question was how does

254
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:26,000
that work so i tried writing some code

255
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,200
that would more or less do the same

256
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,279
thing

257
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,800
and then i tried to make it faster

258
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:33,600
smoother and i kept improving

259
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,719
my code and at some some point it became

260
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,680
obvious that i could

261
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:39,200
draw 3d much faster than starglider

262
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,079
basically drawing on full screen and

263
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,000
still have

264
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,279
what was the standard at the time like

265
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,959
between 15 and 20

266
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:48,480
images possible so i got back to

267
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:51,119
infogram and i have to tell you a little

268
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:54,160
story about that

269
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:55,839
so at some point infogram decided to go

270
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,920
out of games and try

271
00:09:55,839 --> 00:10:00,080
their luck in expert systems of all

272
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:01,439
things and so they asked me to translate

273
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:03,440
the book

274
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,440
and when i came back three months later

275
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:07,920
uh with the finnish translation

276
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,360
they told me basically oh i'm sorry uh

277
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:12,880
we changed our mind it's a bad idea we

278
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,880
won't do that so we we don't pay you

279
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:16,880
and um so i returned to instagram with a

280
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,040
sort of a

281
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:20,959
with a vengeance in mind saying i will

282
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:24,000
get them to pay me something

283
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:26,000
that was basically my objective

284
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,839
and uh so i came with a number of uh

285
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,079
demos on floppy disks

286
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:32,000
um and one of them that i was relatively

287
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:33,519
proud of was a clone of a

288
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,440
relatively popular game at the time

289
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:37,040
called time bandits

290
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,560
that was better than time beneath in a

291
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,319
few respects and much

292
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,599
worse than in other aspects but i

293
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,240
thought that would

294
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:46,000
impress them except they just yawned and

295
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:48,160
they were absolutely not interested at

296
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,160
all

297
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:53,120
but when i showed my last floppy

298
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:54,880
which was not a game it was just a sort

299
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:58,880
of demo thing

300
00:10:54,880 --> 00:11:01,360
um the the director looked like this

301
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,959
he stayed with a joystick like one hour

302
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,600
and then i thought okay maybe i have

303
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:07,040
something that

304
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:09,519
affordable has not seen yet and that was

305
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,640
uh when suddenly i thought okay i need

306
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:14,000
to be careful there

307
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:16,480
and i came back with a standard contract

308
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,240
telling me you're going to work for

309
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:21,360
three months during the summer

310
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:23,279
on amphograms project

311
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,200
and as a training period and you will be

312
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:28,399
paid 7 000 francs which

313
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:30,880
which is about 1 um

314
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:32,160
so i said no sorry did that once not

315
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,200
going to try again so there was one

316
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:36,079
month of

317
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:37,120
you know what they call in star wars uh

318
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:38,800
uh

319
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,040
no it's not ferocious negotiation in

320
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,399
star wars what do they call it

321
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,240
aggressive negotiations there

322
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:45,440
negotiations with this lightsaber

323
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:49,040
basically

324
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:51,839
um so it took a while and after

325
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:53,279
uh i think two or three months of

326
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:55,200
negotiation

327
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:56,560
uh i finally got royalties and i thought

328
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:00,079
you know

329
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:01,040
from here everything is peachy for the

330
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:03,680
you know little

331
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,719
story here uh i forgot at the time was

332
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:07,599
about 40 people

333
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:10,079
in a single floor and all the engineers

334
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:12,480
were outside of the

335
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:14,399
just outside of the desk of the ceo and

336
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,839
when i negotiated with the ceo i

337
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:18,639
remember two things the

338
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:19,360
the ceo is called bruno bonnell the

339
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:20,959
first thing is

340
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,959
at the end of the negotiation he said

341
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:25,760
i'm happy i negotiated with you

342
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:26,560
because i never see people your age

343
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,639
negotiating

344
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:30,079
so it's not fun you know yesterday

345
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:32,240
someone told me i don't need much so

346
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:35,359
that's what he got

347
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:39,839
okay and the second thing i

348
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:42,399
i remember is that at the time i was

349
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:44,399
i when we began discussing i was 18 or

350
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:45,839
19 something like that so i had no idea

351
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:48,639
how the business worked

352
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:50,160
but in my mind it was obvious that if i

353
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:52,079
wrote the game

354
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:54,399
you know 25 percent royalties what was

355
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:56,000
the minimum so that was my

356
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:59,839
no-go zone you know you don't go below

357
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:02,959
25 they started at six

358
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:05,760
so and in the end i got 17 percent

359
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:07,839
royalties and i was very unhappy with it

360
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,800
so but i was just tired so i get out of

361
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:10,560
the room

362
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,079
and all the engineers are watching me

363
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:14,319
just much like you are here

364
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:16,719
and they say so how much did you got and

365
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:20,079
i said i've got 17

366
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:21,680
and they all look at me like how much

367
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:23,519
and apparently i was the first external

368
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:25,439
developer to to get two digits in

369
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:26,800
royalties at unforeground

370
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,140
they did not pay me but that's another

371
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:31,359
story

372
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:34,480
[Laughter]

373
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:36,079
so marketing uh

374
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,760
so infogram was actually impressive

375
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:39,120
enough with the game that they launched

376
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,760
something called the crystal collection

377
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,079
with a new

378
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:43,439
aged theme so this is the team that they

379
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:46,560
had at the time

380
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:48,079
and it looks very 80s right so

381
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,760
that's what the front and back cover

382
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:51,040
looked like um

383
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:53,279
so this is basically what the front

384
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,880
cover looks like and that's

385
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:58,320
the back cover and you can see the the

386
00:13:54,880 --> 00:14:00,240
whole collection crystal over here

387
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,600
team for those of you interested in

388
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,720
history there is another talk about

389
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,399
minitel today

390
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,160
that's what an url looked like at the

391
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:08,160
time 1316

392
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:10,719
franciscan scholars that's how we said

393
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,719
it in french

394
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:18,639
so the collection was

395
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:21,040
oops sorry so we had a few games you had

396
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:24,320
an english version

397
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:27,439
you had a 3d version of tetris

398
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:30,800
a 3d version of arcanoid or

399
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:33,519
brick breakout

400
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:34,560
and um they started 3d fighting even

401
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:36,480
their adventure games

402
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,680
with something called dragon they had

403
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,120
actually started the development of

404
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:41,120
dragon long before

405
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:44,079
but they they put a lot of emphasis on

406
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:46,240
the 3d effects uh

407
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:47,760
for to some extent due to alpha waves

408
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,240
and that's what the games look like at

409
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,880
the time

410
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,440
at the time it was all 2d and typically

411
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,760
uh

412
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,360
exploiting existing franchises and stuff

413
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,639
like that so this is where the idea of

414
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,320
smurfs came to me

415
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:01,120
is i thought if they are doing things

416
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:03,199
like that i could do a smurf based game

417
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:05,680
that was why i was thinking about this

418
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:08,240
also i like i like comics

419
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,719
and another thing that infogram was

420
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,680
doing

421
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:13,279
at the time was the early simcity and if

422
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:15,120
you play some city today you can

423
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:16,720
you cannot think of simcity as being 2d

424
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,279
but that's what it looks like looked

425
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:21,199
like

426
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:23,680
at the beginning so

427
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:24,479
i said they did not pay me royalties

428
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,239
well

429
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,680
here's another another story so

430
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:30,480
basically i got my

431
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:31,599
reports about royalties every six month

432
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,120
or something like that it was it was

433
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,720
supposed to be monthly but they never

434
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:37,120
got them in time

435
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:38,399
and um and they always told me you know

436
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,839
it doesn't sell in the us

437
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:42,399
it doesn't sell in the u.s it doesn't

438
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:45,519
sell in the u.s okay well fine

439
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:46,720
then in 99 i moved to the uh 98 i moved

440
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:48,160
to the us

441
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,079
started being present on some mailing

442
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:52,480
list and i started getting emails saying

443
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:54,160
are you the guy who wrote alphaways we

444
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,759
were playing you know uh land

445
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:57,920
the equivalent of land parties and we

446
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:59,360
were organizing stuff etcetera one email

447
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:02,719
two minutes three maze

448
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:04,320
so after a while but sorry i'm sorry

449
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,920
were you the guy who wrote continuum was

450
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:07,440
the first one

451
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:09,120
and i initially i said no i did not

452
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,639
write this game but they described the

453
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,920
name the game and the game looked very

454
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:13,680
much like alpha waves

455
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:16,319
so what infogram did is they basically

456
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:18,319
renamed it sold it to another company

457
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,839
called data east i had no idea these

458
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,360
things existed that was

459
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:23,440
you know long before internet was

460
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:25,440
prevalent so i had no way of knowing

461
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:27,040
so i believe i never received actually

462
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,639
you know the actual royalties for the

463
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:31,519
continuing version

464
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:33,440
i will never know for sure maybe i'm

465
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:36,000
lying who knows

466
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:37,680
so what did the press think about it

467
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,560
well there was a common theme that the

468
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:42,000
game was hard

469
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:44,319
was cool was innovative um and uh

470
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,320
one of my favorite quotes was a french

471
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:50,560
magazine called generous generation

472
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:52,320
cat generation iv and what they said was

473
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:55,680
we don't know what this guy uses for

474
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,680
drugs but we want the same thing

475
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:02,800
so you have some reviews here some were

476
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:02,800
good some were not as good i remember

477
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:06,640
one of the reviews said something like

478
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:09,199
technically very impressive we only wish

479
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:09,199
it was a game

480
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:17,520
so um

481
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:20,000
thanks to internet the game remains

482
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:22,799
relatively easy to find today so if you

483
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,439
are fond of retro gaming you can find it

484
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:27,119
you know

485
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:29,200
the links on wikipedia there is a

486
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:31,600
this website which i like because

487
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:34,160
because it says that the game

488
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:36,399
is the theme the theme is unique i like

489
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,400
that

490
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:42,559
somehow the game did get a best

491
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:47,840
innovation in 91 a world that i was not

492
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:47,840
aware of before preparing this talk

493
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:53,360
and you can even find it in russian so

494
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:55,120
everything because at the time remember

495
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,639
at the time russia was like completely

496
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:59,120
off the map right so

497
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:00,640
nobody thought this would happen now the

498
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:04,080
major influence of the game

499
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:07,280
is that actually taught 3d to afrogame

500
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:08,960
and uh and that's through a game called

501
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:10,080
alone in the dark who knows about alone

502
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:13,120
in the dark in the room

503
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:15,840
yeah so

504
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:17,280
this guy is a guy named frederick canal

505
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:19,600
who knows him

506
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,879
at least heard about him nobody

507
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,559
seriously

508
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,559
so he's the only the front the only

509
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:27,280
french developer to ever receive the

510
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:28,320
media desiree which is why i have this

511
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,840
picture here

512
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:32,320
um or at least it was the first one

513
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:34,240
maybe there is another one now

514
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,439
and so he bought the alpha waves to the

515
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:38,160
pc

516
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:39,840
and as with all external developers

517
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:42,480
infogram

518
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:44,000
decided to review my code before putting

519
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,600
this thing into production so he started

520
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,280
reviewing the source code

521
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:49,039
and he went to his boss and he said you

522
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,559
know what i can port this to the pc

523
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:53,679
there is one command line

524
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:55,918
comment per line of code and

525
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:57,760
this was not completely true you can

526
00:18:55,919 --> 00:19:00,000
check that in the source code today

527
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:01,200
but what this meant that is that this

528
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,280
was the first game

529
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:06,240
that infogram ported from assembly

530
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:09,678
language to c on the pc

531
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:11,679
um and so doing that it devised a 3d

532
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:13,840
engine that he would later reuse for

533
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:15,600
london in the dark

534
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:17,280
and he would then uh clash with

535
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,320
amphigram because same thing afrogam

536
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,080
would not

537
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:21,678
you know the game sold by the millions

538
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:23,918
and he would not

539
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:25,280
get a pay raise so he said i'm sorry out

540
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:27,280
there there

541
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:29,039
um so that that's what our foreground

542
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:31,918
looked like so you can see that

543
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:33,440
i take no credit for the inspiration

544
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:34,799
only for the 3d

545
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:37,039
because you see it's a completely

546
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:39,039
different way of doing things with

547
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:41,919
actual 2d graphics and a perspective and

548
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:45,760
the 3d is integrated in in it

549
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:47,200
and much less actual 3d because uh

550
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,799
he was doing more complicated things

551
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,720
much more complicated models

552
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:53,280
and so he could not move as many on the

553
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:56,880
screen at the same time

554
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:58,240
but that's really there should be some

555
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,480
sound can you hear it

556
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,480
okay

557
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:05,439
so there was a whole mood and it was

558
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:07,679
really you know the thing that made

559
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:09,760
alone in the dark so unique was this

560
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:11,600
sort of

561
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,879
you know the mood or the sound et cetera

562
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:15,360
so it was a really good

563
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,480
good game i'm a really bad game designer

564
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:20,959
frankly

565
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:24,240
coda okay but but game designer

566
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:25,600
so well you can find this online

567
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,840
let's talk a little bit about the

568
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:30,399
technology so this was the beginning of

569
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:32,080
everything in 3d meaning that in the end

570
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:35,440
we had absolutely nothing to

571
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:37,600
play with so for example

572
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:39,520
this is the machine we were running on

573
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:42,000
that's another est and an amiga

574
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:43,760
and these were bringing 32 bits for

575
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,240
everyone but actually the buses were 16

576
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,720
bits

577
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:48,799
and um internal computations were also

578
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:52,159
often 16 bits

579
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:54,240
what you see here in red is basically

580
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:56,720
the amount of memory in my video

581
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:59,200
ram that corresponds to the whole memory

582
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,200
of this machine

583
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,919
and so you could display 16 colors out

584
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,600
of 512.

585
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:08,240
so these were very cool machines at the

586
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:09,439
time so how do you compute 3d graphics

587
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:11,440
on this kind of machine

588
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:13,840
it's like you want to display 3d with

589
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:15,679
cylix and other backus

590
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:17,360
so you start with a very powerful three

591
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:19,520
accelerator like an nvidia

592
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:20,719
titan or whatever ah no sorry actually i

593
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,400
don't have that

594
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:24,080
okay so but at least i can color the

595
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:26,960
pixels right uh

596
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:28,879
no sorry you can't do that well at least

597
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,600
i can access the pixels individually

598
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,280
right

599
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,559
well no there are multiplanes and they

600
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,840
are in different regions of memory

601
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:36,720
complicated arrangement

602
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:38,080
okay so maybe there is 3d accelerated

603
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:40,320
hardware accelerated uh

604
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:41,120
rendering for polygons right well no

605
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:43,520
sorry

606
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:45,120
all they could accelerate was rectangles

607
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:48,799
okay floating point maybe

608
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:51,120
i know the 682 would come

609
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:54,720
a couple of years later only okay

610
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:54,719
division maybe division is fast

611
00:21:56,159 --> 00:22:02,240
like 158 cycles to the one division

612
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:04,320
okay maybe i can do a multiplication

613
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:05,039
actually a multiplication is only 70

614
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:08,240
cycles so

615
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:10,960
it's faster than division but still

616
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:11,360
okay what about additions ah additions

617
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,520
are

618
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:15,120
four cycles that's good i can do

619
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:17,520
something with additions

620
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:19,280
so basically i rewrote the problem as

621
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:21,760
how can you do 3d graphics with only

622
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,760
additions

623
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:30,000
it's your audition chalet precise

624
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:31,840
okay so for computing sine and cosine

625
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,679
and stuff like that it's easy

626
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:34,879
because basically you just pre-compute

627
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:37,600
integer values

628
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:39,360
you stop that in a table you offset you

629
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,799
do a load and that's basically it and

630
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:43,120
actually you could uh

631
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:45,039
accelerate that by because this was a

632
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:46,158
cis processor so you had a complex

633
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:49,280
addressing mode you could

634
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:51,760
do that in one instruction

635
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:53,120
okay but that's you know that's only for

636
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:55,120
to compute the rotations

637
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:56,799
so now i'm going to show you how you

638
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:58,959
know the tricks inside

639
00:22:56,799 --> 00:23:00,240
so for each 3d object we would have a

640
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:03,280
three rotation

641
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:05,440
along x y and z axis and

642
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:07,440
that there are multiplications you can't

643
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:09,360
avoid that but you can pre-compute

644
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:11,440
with only additions what happens when

645
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:12,240
you have the same vector times two times

646
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:15,520
three times five

647
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:18,640
four five and ten and then you can

648
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:20,559
use this you know by negating it

649
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:22,720
uh to go forwards back backwards so you

650
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:26,158
have minus of this

651
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:27,360
so in the code this is named xp3 zm45

652
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:28,720
etc

653
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:30,240
and you have a table that looks like

654
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:31,360
this so this is the the character that i

655
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:34,159
was playing with

656
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:35,840
that's how it's described in smd code so

657
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:39,760
let's start

658
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:42,959
so xm one gives me gets me there xp2

659
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:44,559
gets me there origin brings me back at

660
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:49,039
the starting point

661
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:50,639
then um zp5

662
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:53,360
cetera so you get you you see the the

663
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:55,039
idea basically i'm jumping like this

664
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:56,559
and there was this special thing go wild

665
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:58,080
go to etc where i could

666
00:23:56,559 --> 00:24:00,158
insert some computations to do some

667
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:02,480
basic animation inside the model

668
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:04,000
so this is how the bouncing of the

669
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:05,360
character is done

670
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,600
and then all you have to do once you

671
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:10,240
have done that is

672
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:12,959
connect the polygons that's the dots

673
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:15,200
with polygons and that's easy

674
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:16,000
now polygon filling was complicated at

675
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,880
the time

676
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,919
it was really critical to performance so

677
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:23,120
um

678
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:24,640
i used something called brazen ham's uh

679
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,840
line algorithm i don't know if you are

680
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:27,120
familiar with that but look it up on

681
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:29,360
google is very interesting

682
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:30,399
and what this does is basically uh you

683
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:32,399
you compute

684
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,600
this movement using only additional

685
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,520
subtraction

686
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:37,279
what i was very proud of is that while

687
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:39,279
understanding why this was working

688
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:40,960
i realized that you could also do that

689
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:43,360
for circles and ellipses

690
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:45,279
and so alpha ways is probably also the

691
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:47,120
first game where you had real circles on

692
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:50,400
screen there were a number of circular

693
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:50,399
objects just to show off

694
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,879
so that's the extension to ellipse and

695
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,960
uh

696
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:58,480
but then infogram asked me could you

697
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,400
please use our code because it's

698
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,200
portable we could use that to put that

699
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,600
to

700
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:05,039
the pc or to the amiga platform so i

701
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:07,039
looked at their code and

702
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:08,960
um the code did not work on the tt

703
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:10,799
because it was using self-modifying code

704
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:13,360
so i said sorry i don't want to have

705
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:15,039
that so i spent some time

706
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:16,559
rewriting that using something called

707
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:18,640
the depth device

708
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:20,399
and by doing that i was actually 30

709
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:21,120
faster than the original code so we kept

710
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,320
that

711
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:24,399
that's my other contribution to

712
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:26,799
unforeground so

713
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:28,480
about the music so you have the whole

714
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:30,799
playlist on youtube here

715
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:32,240
if you want to scan it it's uh it's

716
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:34,559
pretty cool actually

717
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:38,400
that some guy saved it so that's the the

718
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:40,879
pc version of the music that you hear

719
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:42,159
so the atarist had this music but only

720
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:43,679
during the intro

721
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:46,320
and the reason is that because it did

722
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:48,320
the the 512 520 which has

723
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:49,760
512k of memory did not have enough

724
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:52,720
memory for both the game

725
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:54,240
and the music at the same time so it was

726
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:56,000
stored on the second side of the floppy

727
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,440
disk and the second side of the floppy

728
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,679
disk was also

729
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:02,080
something that only existed on the 1040

730
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:03,919
st so that was basically my trick i have

731
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:05,199
a second side i can load the music and

732
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:07,039
at the same time i have the memory to

733
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:09,679
store it so that's good

734
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:11,039
except at some point a magazine was

735
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:12,480
hired by a foreground

736
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:14,080
to at the time you know you had

737
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:15,279
properties with magazines with

738
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:17,678
promotions

739
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:18,720
and they only copied one side and then

740
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:21,039
they blamed me

741
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,840
because the game crashed not finding the

742
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:24,080
music on

743
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:25,439
10 40 st saying you know trying to read

744
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,918
from the second side and said sorry no

745
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:29,200
music

746
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:31,440
quitting and uh of course they blamed

747
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:33,120
it on me so i wrote to them an angry

748
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:34,880
letter and they never replied to me of

749
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:36,639
course

750
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:38,559
on the pc you have a relatively high

751
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:40,320
quality added music and that's why you

752
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:43,039
can still find it on youtube today

753
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:44,480
is because folks really love this music

754
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:48,000
it was really exploiting the

755
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:50,480
the music so composed by frederic manson

756
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,159
those of you who are french may have

757
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:53,840
heard of a group at the time that was

758
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:56,000
called the voyage de nos

759
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:57,199
and he was part of this band for a short

760
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,120
time

761
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:01,200
and the good thing for me as the author

762
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:04,000
is that i have the original music

763
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:07,039
as performed on a synth which is much

764
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:09,600
much better

765
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:10,720
now if you want to check the source code

766
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:12,559
and an article

767
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:15,120
that talks about this you can find them

768
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:15,120
online so

769
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:21,199
the source code is 17k lines

770
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:21,678
of assembly code 68 casts on the code

771
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,440
and

772
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:25,279
the article is basically me ranting

773
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,919
about the stuff that i told you about

774
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:27,600
today

775
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:29,760
but going into more details for polygon

776
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:33,039
drawing and stuff like that

777
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:34,559
and with that one last qr code is i just

778
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:36,320
released these books so for

779
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:37,678
french-speaking people if you want to

780
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:39,439
buy this book it's a very good sci-fi

781
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:42,640
book

782
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:45,760
that's why you know what i do today

783
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,760
and that's about it if you have

784
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:49,840
questions

785
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:55,600
so how much time do we have for

786
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:55,600
questions

787
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:59,120
three minutes for

788
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:04,880
the guy that questions mentioned who

789
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:07,600
would uh be deported

790
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:08,320
he isn't incidentally the one who made

791
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:12,559
um

792
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:14,000
flashback and um in other words

793
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:16,000
because i know that this is also a

794
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:19,679
french yeah so he went to make

795
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:21,679
a number of of titles uh like dozens

796
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:23,279
uh so you want to create a company

797
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:26,480
called adeline software

798
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:28,080
and then had little big adventure had a

799
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,640
number of things like that so maybe many

800
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:31,279
titles

801
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:33,919
later he stayed in the in the business

802
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:35,840
me not being paid sort of disgusted me

803
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:37,679
of that business i said look you know

804
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:40,399
it's not just for fun

805
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:42,159
uh but he wasn't involved with built-in

806
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:44,479
software

807
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:44,910
not that i remember okay i don't think

808
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:48,019
so

809
00:28:44,910 --> 00:28:48,019
[Music]

810
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:52,799
yeah no i i that doesn't ring a bell but

811
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,240
possibly

812
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:56,960
he has done so many things i can't

813
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,960
really thought

814
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:02,158
um yeah so i said i did not get paid at

815
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:04,240
all that's not completely true there is

816
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:07,360
one good thing that came out of this

817
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:13,840
is that the ring my wife is wearing was

818
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:13,840
played by this guy

819
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:18,399
uh how did you manage the separate color

820
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:21,039
palettes

821
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:22,559
so uh the question is how did i manage

822
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:25,919
to have uh separate color

823
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:26,720
planets into player mode so the atari st

824
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:29,200
had

825
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:30,000
this very nice feature where you had 16

826
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,320
registers

827
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,279
which you could write directly to change

828
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:36,158
the color

829
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:38,240
and it happened instantly and one of the

830
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:40,640
the registers were used color 0 was used

831
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:42,240
for the border of the screen

832
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:44,080
so what you did was basically you would

833
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,399
sync you had an interrupt which was the

834
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:46,399
best

835
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:48,239
vertical blanking interrupt you would

836
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:49,279
count how many lines have been displaced

837
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,880
on the screen

838
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:52,240
and when you are the right spot in the

839
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:53,279
middle of the screen you'd flip the

840
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:55,039
palette

841
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:56,480
which code that was somewhat tricky

842
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:58,158
because it had to take into account

843
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:59,520
whether you were at 60 health or 50

844
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:01,200
hertz and stuff like that

845
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:02,960
but you know it was some somewhat

846
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:06,799
standout at the time

847
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:08,240
now i must say that this brings back

848
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:09,840
another thing i wanted to tell you but i

849
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:11,279
forgot a very

850
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:13,439
interesting trick that you could do at a

851
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:15,279
time and is really hard to do today

852
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,720
is if you wanted to instrument how long

853
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:18,480
some code took

854
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:19,760
you could basically write into a color

855
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:21,200
into this register

856
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:23,360
and change the color when you exited the

857
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:26,640
routine and you would have on screen you

858
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:26,639
know how much time it took

859
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:32,799
that's a trick i used on the zx spectrum

860
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:32,799
and then on on atarist quite a bit

861
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:37,840
any other question

862
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:44,000
so the question is do i still have

863
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:46,399
another estee running the game

864
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,080
i have a natarist i have two of them i

865
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:49,678
actually have the original one that was

866
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,960
used to develop that which happens to be

867
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:54,799
a stacy

868
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:56,640
the stacy was a the idea of a laptop

869
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:58,240
and it had a built-in black and white

870
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:59,200
screen which is why this game is also

871
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:02,640
running in black and white

872
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:04,720
because my own laptop was running this

873
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:06,240
unfortunately neither of them is running

874
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:07,600
anymore um

875
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:10,559
i have a larger collection i have about

876
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:12,879
70 machines total

877
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:14,080
i can do something about it the at rst i

878
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,200
can't really repair it because it

879
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,879
basically

880
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,559
well i could but i need to replace the

881
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:20,320
whole motherboard the motherboard was

882
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:23,840
damaged

883
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:26,320
i'm sorry no no it's what's that

884
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,320
it was meant

885
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:46,480
so thank you thank you very much
