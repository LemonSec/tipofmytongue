1
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:11,678
sorry

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:14,920
okay um how many are familiar with steam

3
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:17,920
okay just wanted to verify so let's go

4
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:20,960
um i'm eched i am a

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:24,240
core developer in the spring rts engine

6
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:27,599
um this rts engine stands like

7
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:29,439
real time strategy and while we have

8
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:29,920
lots of games well i don't know lots but

9
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:32,079
there are

10
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:33,360
quite a number of games the engine

11
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:36,480
itself is

12
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:39,200
supplies you know some underlying

13
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,640
services that most games use like it

14
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,480
supplies some scripting

15
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,879
language so the games can actually be

16
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,919
written by something that is not c plus

17
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:48,079
plus

18
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,320
it supplies physics everything is really

19
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:51,520
like simulated the units cannot shoot

20
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,840
through units until

21
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,440
unless you like have a certain tag that

22
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,760
says do not collide

23
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,440
and you know graphics pipeline

24
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:03,039
pathfinding which is

25
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:04,319
an endless work uh networking so you can

26
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:09,119
play with your friends

27
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:10,798
and currently uh we have 27 963 commits

28
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:13,680
so it's been kind of busy

29
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,400
it's the first like um version was

30
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,000
released on

31
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:20,560
2005 moulders so it's been

32
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,600
i think april yeah and it's been working

33
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,960
even before

34
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:26,320
and in total we had something like 100

35
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,640
contributors

36
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:30,000
but at the moment the team the core team

37
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:33,119
i mean like people who

38
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,560
touch you know feel comfortable starting

39
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:37,600
everywhere is kind of

40
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,240
less than two and and i'm like half at

41
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,679
least

42
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:45,119
at story at most um so this is

43
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:48,320
the engine it started

44
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:51,040
um as a reimagining of a

45
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,439
proprietary rts game total annihilation

46
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,799
that

47
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:57,919
came out in 97 by 2005 you know

48
00:01:54,799 --> 00:02:00,479
hardware was quite better um you could

49
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:02,000
use you know video cards in order to

50
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:04,719
render stuff

51
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,520
inhalation was using all kinds of weird

52
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:09,280
tricks to

53
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:12,560
render um 3d models from a fixed

54
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:15,760
camera so ta spring as

55
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:18,080
it was in the beginning um

56
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,679
could do it from a different angle and

57
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,560
if you can see this is like the same

58
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,840
model this thing

59
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,160
is what this is here and and it's really

60
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,480
just

61
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,760
use the assets from the original game

62
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:33,040
but

63
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:34,959
um using a real 3d engine

64
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,720
but time has passed and people

65
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:38,480
understood wait we have an actual game

66
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:41,519
engine we don't just have to

67
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:44,640
pulse total annihilation as it is

68
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:45,519
so other games were made such as 0k

69
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,879
which you can

70
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:51,760
kind of see that it is similar to the

71
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:52,879
mood and things how they looked in total

72
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:55,280
annihilation

73
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:56,879
and evolution rts which kind of moved

74
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:00,080
from it but it is

75
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:00,079
similar in some ways

76
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,000
and our games that look quite more

77
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:06,799
different went into

78
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,519
not robots fighting robots but um i

79
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,440
don't know

80
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:11,680
you might recognize some of the things

81
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:15,120
that we probably have no license for

82
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:18,319
or spring 44 that that nobody

83
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:21,120
requires a license for um

84
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:22,640
and they play quite differently for um

85
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,280
total relation games

86
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,920
and you have like really different games

87
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,840
uh

88
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,920
kernel panic as you can see like

89
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,640
entirely changed how the graphics is

90
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,879
imagined

91
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:34,159
and it's still an rts but it's like

92
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:36,640
inside a computer

93
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:37,920
gravitas which was made in a game gym in

94
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:41,119
72 hours

95
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:42,640
um was quite fun to make and it's a

96
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,200
puzzle game

97
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,640
not even an rts so their controls are

98
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,958
wasd

99
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:51,119
it's it's really really different we've

100
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:53,439
made more games in uh

101
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,040
game gems it's it's like as a

102
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:55,840
recommendation in general if you make an

103
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,000
engine

104
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,959
uh game gems are an excellent way of

105
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,840
testing

106
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:03,840
what is fast what isn't fast can what

107
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,400
things work where where

108
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,120
developers um need a little bit more

109
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,959
help

110
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:13,920
like your users um so area 17 was a

111
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:16,000
really fun game about a uh an alien

112
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,599
looking for that partner who

113
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,600
ditched it on earth and you're like

114
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,320
burning the entire place with doomsday

115
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,400
weapons

116
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,479
and personally that was just a spooky

117
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:27,520
you know a first person

118
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:30,400
um perspective game that

119
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:32,560
also could kind of happen uh and then

120
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:36,400
you'd be really like testing the limits

121
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:40,320
of spring it might be an rts engine but

122
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:43,198
maybe the abilities

123
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:44,080
can be used in many ways but let's talk

124
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:47,280
about 0k

125
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:51,919
0k as i showed is one of the games

126
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:54,638
and they wanted to release it on steam

127
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:56,479
so if we look about 0k like the past

128
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:59,199
history the first version of it was

129
00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:02,000
really somewhere around 2007

130
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:02,800
and with games like this the first

131
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,120
release is not

132
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,000
usually when people start to actually

133
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,759
play it in

134
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,600
in masses when i say masters i don't

135
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:11,680
mean like the

136
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,039
aaa games but i mean like that whenever

137
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,479
you come in the evening and you want to

138
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:15,840
join the game you will find people to

139
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:18,719
play with this is like

140
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:20,400
a very important measurement uh and this

141
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,720
happened in like 2009

142
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,440
and since then like consistently which

143
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,120
is quite

144
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,960
impressive to be more than 10 years

145
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:30,000
consistently

146
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:33,198
you know finding people to play with um

147
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,199
it it's like one of the more more

148
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,520
popular games in the spring engine at

149
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:38,639
the

150
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:41,680
moment i think it's the most popular and

151
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:45,680
in 2013 or so um

152
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,680
steam came up with the green light

153
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:52,560
thing are you familiar with green light

154
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,520
no i saw and also i will say grenade was

155
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,000
basically because

156
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:57,599
uh steam we're understanding that they

157
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,720
start to be in a monopoly

158
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:02,720
in uh deciding which games are

159
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,240
released on steam and which not and when

160
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,479
you are kind of

161
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,440
deciding which games written audience or

162
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:09,840
not that

163
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,800
might be a problem for a government and

164
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,679
stuff so

165
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,240
they kind of offloaded the work to use

166
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,560
it

167
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,560
greenlight was a thing where you put

168
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,000
your game to the popular vote and if

169
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,800
there are enough votes

170
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,120
it will be released in steam eventually

171
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:28,720
like it will be accepted

172
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:29,199
so steam green light like 0k put the

173
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,479
game

174
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:34,960
in april 2014 uh it was like

175
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:36,719
in the same month it was accepted

176
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,120
because there were enough users to just

177
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,479
bring

178
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:44,000
and you know bring them to vote

179
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:46,479
um and then um

180
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,919
just you can see this is in may you know

181
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:48,719
even though your green light it doesn't

182
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:51,359
mean you you have

183
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,319
to release the moment uh you get the

184
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,280
green light

185
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:56,319
uh likho is you know a core developer of

186
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,479
0k

187
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:00,319
and he said like we have to prepare and

188
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:02,080
double check lots of things now so

189
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:05,280
probably a couple of weeks

190
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:08,080
this happened in may 2014 when people

191
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:09,359
asked um when it's going to be released

192
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:12,560
and and then like you know

193
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:14,560
in june 2014 and a little bit more than

194
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:18,800
two weeks it got released

195
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:21,919
uh so so that's all um any questions

196
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,639
yeah so so a question like that you

197
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:26,159
might

198
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:28,400
ask yourself is what really happened um

199
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,280
let's let's talk about something that

200
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:32,400
happened

201
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:33,840
a tiny bit before that remember that i

202
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:37,599
showed next to

203
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:40,000
0k another game evolution rts

204
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:42,479
so it was released the first version

205
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,680
also around 2007

206
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:47,520
um quite near the timeline of 0k it

207
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,400
never reached a big popularity there

208
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,159
were people playing

209
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:52,159
it has a community it has a community

210
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:55,199
now but it wasn't

211
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:57,440
in the same level and it

212
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:58,960
submitted itself to steam greenlight

213
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:02,080
very early like

214
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:05,120
near the beginning of this

215
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:07,840
endeavor by stem it also got

216
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,680
green leads in really really fast

217
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:13,679
because the entire spring community

218
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:17,599
happily helped it and to be greenlit

219
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:20,160
and it launched 4th april 2014.

220
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:22,159
as you can see this is very very close

221
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:24,960
to the 0k green light

222
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:28,319
now this all seems very nice except that

223
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,318
there was a catastrophe

224
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:35,760
steam decided that they want to

225
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:39,200
advertise games and on the main screen

226
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:44,159
when people opened steam there was this

227
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:46,560
feature about evolution rts

228
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:48,800
now you can say oh my god this is like

229
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:52,719
the most amazing thing that can happen

230
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:56,079
to a game not exactly

231
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:57,839
what if like the game is stationed on a

232
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,399
server which isn't even its own it's

233
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:01,360
like a

234
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:02,480
server of the spring engine and the

235
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,120
spring engine never

236
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:08,320
experienced a big influx of players and

237
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:11,680
maybe we had like some problems where

238
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:14,480
every user gets all updates about

239
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:17,439
all other users if you count fast this

240
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,440
is off and square

241
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:24,640
so when there are a hundred people okay

242
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:26,240
when there's like 500 maybe a thousand

243
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:30,080
or right but

244
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:31,760
this goes up fast and if everybody and

245
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:34,839
his sister from steam

246
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:36,160
comes at the same time what you get is

247
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:38,640
this

248
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:40,640
this is the call developer like of

249
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:43,839
evolution rts a one man army

250
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:45,040
and he wrote on the forums in 7th april

251
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:47,839
2014

252
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:50,560
please help me i'm at work and steam

253
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:51,279
users are flooding in blah blah blah

254
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,599
this is like

255
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:54,959
we had technical issues now in order to

256
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,920
like explain how

257
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:59,680
big of a problem it was like people from

258
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:01,680
spring that don't even play evolution

259
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:03,439
rts like came and started helping and

260
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,800
assisting people how to get into rooms

261
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,800
how to open them

262
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,800
and we will see later why it's going why

263
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:11,920
it's hard there were people

264
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:14,160
from other games also trying to steal

265
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,839
evolution rts players into their own

266
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,160
game and then somebody starts a game and

267
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:18,640
they

268
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:20,160
see another an entirely different game

269
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:22,160
so

270
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,519
it was mayhem and then you have all the

271
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:26,640
people that it doesn't work and

272
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:29,040
and you know things became slow um

273
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,880
and and then like you can see reviews

274
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:33,760
cropping up like this one

275
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:36,160
and this is very sad note this is not a

276
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:38,800
review of the gameplay itself and you'll

277
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:41,199
find out why in a second

278
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:43,040
the download for the game is simply a

279
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:47,440
download for a game lobby

280
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:48,160
oh god why i hung around for around 25

281
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,399
minutes

282
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,360
trying to figure out how to just start a

283
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:53,760
game

284
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,480
okay this makes no sense like somebody

285
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,000
wants to

286
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,760
start a game they should be able to

287
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,160
start a game something

288
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:01,680
was definitely rotten in spring and the

289
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:05,199
entire ecosystem

290
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:06,079
if somebody spends 25 minutes trying to

291
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:09,600
run a game

292
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:10,079
now this is even worse when your game is

293
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,920
free

294
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:15,760
like let's say you are a big company and

295
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:17,519
like um you release a game and then

296
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:19,760
somebody paid for your game here they

297
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:21,680
have sunk costs they will spend 25

298
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,399
minutes an hour to land your game to do

299
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,399
something

300
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:26,240
if they downloaded it for free and

301
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:28,560
things don't work they will just like

302
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:31,120
uninstall it and play something else

303
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:34,160
there is no sun cost there is no big

304
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:37,360
reason for them to persevere

305
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:40,480
so um this

306
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:41,519
is the current state now it was worse

307
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,600
before that

308
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:45,440
like after the release but currently

309
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:49,040
it's like 50 percent

310
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:51,519
of positive reviews is not good and the

311
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,160
bad thing that it's not about the game

312
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:54,839
the game is

313
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:56,639
quite quite nice like it's not bad at

314
00:11:54,839 --> 00:12:00,399
all so

315
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:02,800
i talked about lobbies and and

316
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:04,720
let's let's start talking about lobbies

317
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:07,120
this is how a lobby looks it looks

318
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:10,320
nothing like evolutionary yes this is a

319
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:13,600
tough client and it's also um the f

320
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:14,800
lobby i think and wait um spring lobby

321
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,360
as you can see

322
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,319
many people tried to write lobbies they

323
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,480
were like

324
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,839
always people unhappy with how the

325
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:25,040
previous lobby looked

326
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:26,800
um and wait i think there are more like

327
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:28,399
this is spring web lobby

328
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:31,040
and then they made another version of

329
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:33,839
spring web lobby using react

330
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:34,959
and 0k understood that it just makes no

331
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:36,800
sense that every

332
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:38,638
like lobbies work with all games so

333
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,959
maybe we they should make their own

334
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:42,560
0k lobby but you can still see other

335
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:45,680
games like pants annihilation

336
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:48,079
and so what is going on and

337
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:49,599
oh this is like this is a new one this

338
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:50,638
actually i gave this talk a year and a

339
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,120
half ago

340
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:55,040
more or less and this is a new one that

341
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:57,120
somebody started making

342
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,959
just a screenshot it wasn't released yet

343
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:01,279
and i also found this one

344
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:02,079
and okay something is really really

345
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:05,200
insane

346
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:07,599
if you have like 10 i don't know how

347
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:10,720
many i probably missed some

348
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:12,800
so many lobbies why is the lobby even

349
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:15,839
necessary we're trying to play a game

350
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:16,880
why can't i start evolution rts and this

351
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:20,160
is

352
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:23,439
for for a very interesting reason

353
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:25,920
when you start spring.exe this is what

354
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,920
you see

355
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:31,040
what i don't know what to do here is

356
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:34,160
like select a game select a map

357
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:36,959
what is a script test what

358
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,600
is this this this looks horrendous and

359
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:41,040
and this is

360
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:45,040
i'm not even exaggerating when i

361
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:46,560
first downloaded spring in like 2007 or

362
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:49,760
six or something like this

363
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:51,680
i was sure i'm going to play

364
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:53,120
single-player total annihilation with

365
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,719
spring because nowhere in

366
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,880
in like the website said it's

367
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,560
multiplayer only there is kind of single

368
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,040
player that's basically multiplayer and

369
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,359
i just

370
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,959
run spring.exe because it made sense and

371
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,800
i see this and i don't understand

372
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:06,719
anything what's going on

373
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,399
and i just gave up after a bit and then

374
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,560
like i found launchers for

375
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:12,240
oh some of the game had single-player

376
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:14,560
launches in order to like

377
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:16,320
replace the lobby and and what is like a

378
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:18,800
launcher needed for

379
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:20,399
because if you just run the spring exit

380
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,279
you just get this screen that isn't

381
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:23,839
supposed to be

382
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:24,320
used by any user instead like there's

383
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:26,959
this

384
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,680
text file which is called a script which

385
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:30,000
says like

386
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:31,439
oh this is the game used there are

387
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,399
decent that teams

388
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:35,600
um this who against whom like the

389
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:38,880
alliance says

390
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:40,560
uh um it holds an ip if you're like

391
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:42,800
trying to connect somewhere

392
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:44,079
and something has to generate it and

393
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,240
it's not the user

394
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:48,000
so naturally this program will be a

395
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,720
lobby that handles all the network stuff

396
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,120
of like

397
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,399
this is what's going to the game looks

398
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:55,920
like where the server

399
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:59,519
and then they send like um the um

400
00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:03,199
directions to the users to

401
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:06,560
generate this text file and start spring

402
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:06,560
with that text file

403
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:11,199
okay how the hell did we get to this

404
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:14,800
situation

405
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:17,920
like it would make no sense for

406
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,959
any place to use it but i think it's an

407
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:22,399
inherent thing

408
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:26,000
in open source uh software

409
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:29,360
like um this is a quote um

410
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:31,680
by eric s raymond i for it

411
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:33,279
misses the attribution but anyway

412
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:35,680
there's a closely related issue

413
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:38,839
however that i don't know doing

414
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:40,079
systematic user interface and user

415
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:44,160
testing

416
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:45,359
and why is that so difficult to test

417
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:48,399
user interface

418
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:51,040
with end users is because basically

419
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:53,680
users don't want to do tests

420
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:55,839
um and you cannot trust developers to do

421
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,880
tests because then they use text files

422
00:15:55,839 --> 00:16:00,959
and and

423
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:03,600
and stuff like this and and and use that

424
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:04,239
testing costs money so if you don't have

425
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,320
it

426
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:08,399
it's it's a bit of a problem or you need

427
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:11,199
like lots of users that

428
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:12,480
will agree to to or maybe not agree just

429
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:12,959
release a version and see what's going

430
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,240
on

431
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:16,319
because everybody has a testing

432
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:18,000
environment some people are lucky enough

433
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:20,000
to have a totally separate environment

434
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,639
to run production in and this is what we

435
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,120
all

436
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:23,839
always do in spring we just like release

437
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:26,959
stuff and

438
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:30,880
see what happens um

439
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:33,920
so in this case the big

440
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:36,720
um i don't know that the huge

441
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:38,079
loss here was evolution rts they were

442
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:41,360
the testing

443
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:44,239
environment for 0k so 0k

444
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:47,040
says that like a week ago there was a

445
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:48,959
disaster with the current situation

446
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,719
something has to be changed so we don't

447
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:52,239
release and we don't suffer the same

448
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,079
fate

449
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,560
and this is why it wasn't released two

450
00:16:54,079 --> 00:17:00,000
weeks later

451
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:02,560
um so

452
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,120
this is kind of what i said and like

453
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,799
useless

454
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,640
is is a limited results and dev's time

455
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:08,240
is in even more limited resources this

456
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,559
is why we don't just

457
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:11,839
pay developers also to check because we

458
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:14,240
want them to develop stuff

459
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:15,678
and and you know goodwill like you can

460
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:20,400
only release

461
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:22,720
so many um crap

462
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:25,600
releases until you won't have any users

463
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:27,120
to test them

464
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:29,600
and we talked about free games having it

465
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:32,959
worse and and even if you are

466
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:34,480
improving stuff some people will not

467
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,840
like it because they've been playing

468
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,760
since 2005

469
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:39,439
and they're used to things just

470
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:41,840
remaining the same way if you don't know

471
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,480
this xkcd check my presentation later

472
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:45,199
and and

473
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:46,799
read it it is one of the best um but but

474
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:49,360
basically users would like

475
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:50,639
things to stay the same and if you're

476
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:54,080
trying to

477
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:56,240
get um to new audience you have to

478
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:59,280
change the things that are broken

479
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:02,160
so there's kind of a tension if you

480
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,639
while you are doing the tests for uh the

481
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:06,080
new

482
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:07,760
people you're losing like veterans

483
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:09,520
and is it worth it are you sure that the

484
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,320
new people will come it's a bit of a

485
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:14,080
problem

486
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:17,039
um it's a bit like you know the

487
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:18,879
from the end user perspective they think

488
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:20,480
that you're just trying to ruin the day

489
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,240
think that you were in school and you

490
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,760
thought that like if the teacher is

491
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:26,400
giving you a bad grade that

492
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,960
like they hate you or something and when

493
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:30,400
i was

494
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:33,039
teaching in uh you know junior high

495
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,480
i was like i understood that like the

496
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:35,600
kids don't understand that i'm on their

497
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,280
side

498
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,879
and if i'm telling them something is

499
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:40,559
wrong it's because i want them to get it

500
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,960
right the next time

501
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:44,559
and i had like you have to tell the kids

502
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:47,120
all the time i'm on your side

503
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:48,240
i i want you to succeed so this is kind

504
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:50,479
of the same with with

505
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,840
our end user they just think oh my god

506
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:55,200
the developers cannot

507
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:56,639
just you know and keep the things good

508
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,000
they have to change things all the time

509
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:00,080
because they are bored

510
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,280
and no we don't we we actually want

511
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:03,439
things to improve

512
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:04,559
we were very sorry that things don't

513
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:08,080
always do this

514
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:09,120
but like yes sorry this is like a zero

515
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,199
case length i

516
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:13,280
hope you like it if not well nothing

517
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:17,760
today about it

518
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:17,760
it's uh yeah anyway

519
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:28,400
okay so let's understand what had to be

520
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:31,440
um changed uh

521
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:33,760
between like um

522
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:35,520
the the planned release and the release

523
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,080
first of all the server we talked about

524
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:39,200
the o

525
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:39,600
of n square something has to like solve

526
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,000
this

527
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:43,360
so we you can actually support one

528
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,480
thousand two thousand

529
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:50,399
i don't know as many as might come

530
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:53,360
a lobby of course is a problem

531
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:55,039
we cannot just use the current system it

532
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,080
makes no sense that you will see a list

533
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:58,559
of

534
00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:00,559
20 games and and that lobby doesn't even

535
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:02,720
look like the game you know

536
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:03,600
people look in a screenshot in steam and

537
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,840
they want

538
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,879
the things they run to kind of look the

539
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:08,959
same it's about

540
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:10,400
branding it's about like understanding

541
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:13,120
what's going on

542
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,679
user interface um i will show in a

543
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:16,719
second

544
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:18,880
why it had some problems but as

545
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:21,919
a game made by developers kind of for

546
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:22,240
developers it was very customizable to

547
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:25,760
to

548
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:29,440
to like too much single player

549
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:31,440
um like many many games

550
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,960
the multiplayer community is much

551
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,559
smaller than a single player and you

552
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,280
kind of get you know a foot in the door

553
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:39,039
if you have

554
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:42,080
some single player um

555
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:43,360
presence so you're not just like for the

556
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:45,760
die hard

557
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:47,039
you know where starcraft insane people

558
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,799
and the trailer

559
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:50,559
because if you change things like you

560
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:51,120
had all trailers but if you change

561
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:52,879
things

562
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:54,320
then you need a trailer that shows how

563
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:57,760
the game looks now and

564
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,760
not how it looks before

565
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,879
how did we solve all this stuff and when

566
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:03,120
we

567
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,799
i say we even though i wasn't in 0k

568
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:06,719
because because kind of the entire

569
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:09,840
ecosystem had to like

570
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:11,280
work and change things in order um for

571
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:16,320
this to

572
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:20,080
improve how much time when did i start

573
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:22,559
20 minutes 20 minutes amazing um so

574
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:24,158
first of all there was seven migrations

575
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:27,280
0k decided

576
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:30,159
to just make their own back end and like

577
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:31,039
at first there were some issues because

578
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:32,799
um

579
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:34,960
why can't you just like work with the

580
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:38,400
current server which the server was good

581
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:39,919
but in the end um this was the the exact

582
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:42,000
tension about

583
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:44,720
when you're a game that is released you

584
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,080
the biggest thing you need is stability

585
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:48,559
and they couldn't just stay on the

586
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:51,199
bleeding edge of the server like

587
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:52,639
it's in the engine uh second thing

588
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:55,200
in-game lobby

589
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:56,880
why not take the lobby and put it in the

590
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:59,520
same executable

591
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,320
so you don't have to like run lots of

592
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:04,000
stuff

593
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:07,039
and and and this is a good thing

594
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:09,120
the gui revamp was like

595
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:10,879
basically trying to standardize

596
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:14,479
everything i will show it

597
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:17,840
and the rest was compromises and luck

598
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:21,440
and we will go through everything um

599
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:24,320
first in-game lobby like uh

600
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:25,760
when we started talking about lobbies as

601
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,639
you can see like that many people did

602
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:30,320
lobbies even

603
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:32,799
more people try to like um come up with

604
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:34,080
different designs on the forums it's

605
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:37,760
more just like funny

606
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:40,799
because um

607
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:43,039
and and basically all the people would

608
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:45,840
just forum post about stuff instead of

609
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:46,720
instead of uh you know actually doing

610
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:50,399
anything

611
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:51,679
uh what even like i can say that i don't

612
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,200
understand what's going on here but i

613
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:54,320
actually made this one so i do

614
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:57,600
understand

615
00:22:54,320 --> 00:23:00,639
um and and what yeah this was like

616
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:02,879
criticism of the entire 0k project

617
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:04,320
anyway this is the in-game lobby i think

618
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,480
it's quite nice here

619
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:07,600
and you know that two really really

620
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:10,240
important things

621
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:13,280
one of them it has 0k in the top so you

622
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:16,320
know that you started the right game

623
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:16,320
it's not a joke

624
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:21,280
and other things like there's like

625
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:23,600
single player multiplayer

626
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:25,280
it doesn't like clutter your screen way

627
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:27,760
too much only a little bit and

628
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:29,360
and you will believe me maybe i will

629
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:31,919
show later how like

630
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:33,600
you'd really need very few clicks in

631
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:36,640
order to get in a game

632
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:38,639
you don't need like to spy this small

633
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:40,559
ready box that you have to tick in all

634
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:42,799
the and i don't know what and that's

635
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:44,960
like

636
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:46,799
they implemented a matchmaker so that's

637
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,360
like in two clicks you can wait in a

638
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:51,039
queue

639
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:51,678
um if the community is a bit bigger then

640
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:53,760
you wait

641
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:55,279
short time but now it's like you know a

642
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,480
long time after the stimulus you might

643
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:59,679
wait a lot

644
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:00,720
but uh it's like with regards to the

645
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:04,240
approach it was

646
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:06,080
really really useful in the first few um

647
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:08,080
weeks let's say after release and even

648
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:09,600
now people are using the matchmaker for

649
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:11,918
like competitive playing

650
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,918
um

651
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:16,639
this is like the old user interface and

652
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:21,279
you can see like you have

653
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:25,600
lots of stuff just floating around um

654
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:27,440
and they're not entirely like um

655
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,719
how do you call it consistent with each

656
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:31,600
other like this

657
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:32,080
um player list which is kind of in the

658
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,639
way

659
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:35,840
is not doesn't really look related to

660
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:39,679
any of this

661
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:42,480
um stuff and and this just floats like

662
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:43,200
i don't know uh and this is because you

663
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,840
see this

664
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:47,600
little button this green arrow if you

665
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:48,080
click it then you can just like move

666
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,240
your

667
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:52,000
go around wherever you want and you have

668
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:54,000
like if you press f11

669
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,919
you can choose all kinds of widgets and

670
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,919
stuff that you can add you can remove

671
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:59,279
everything was like immensely

672
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:02,320
customizable that is

673
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:04,799
awesome it's part of the reason why um

674
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:06,080
spring's user interface is very powerful

675
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:08,240
but very ugly

676
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:10,000
like there's a cost benefit here but

677
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:12,640
once you want to release a game

678
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:15,120
you should kind of use what power

679
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:17,440
already exists and and try to come

680
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:19,120
make things more consistent now i don't

681
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,919
want you to think that the only thing

682
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,678
changed was

683
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:23,039
moving the mini-map from the left to the

684
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:24,799
right um

685
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:27,600
you can also flip it there's like a

686
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:28,559
setting um but but in general everything

687
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:31,439
is kind of

688
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:32,240
better docked to two places and they got

689
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:34,159
rid of this

690
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:35,840
really really bad button that lets you

691
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:37,440
move everything you can

692
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:39,520
if you really really want to shoot

693
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:42,400
yourself in the leg you can kind of

694
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:44,559
find it hidden somewhere in the settings

695
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:47,520
but

696
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:48,240
in in general this was much better um

697
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:51,840
and

698
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:55,039
like i use it there were also

699
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:57,360
compromises made

700
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:58,320
this is a single player campaign instead

701
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:01,279
of going you know

702
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:01,600
full red light with stories and and and

703
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:03,600
the

704
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:05,120
plots and i don't know what that this

705
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:07,760
was kind of the idea

706
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:08,639
uh in the beginning and just somebody

707
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,960
came up and said

708
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:11,919
okay let's just do a galaxy map when you

709
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,760
like go from

710
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:15,919
planet to planet and every planet you

711
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:18,640
unlock new units

712
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:20,159
and there's not story just like you

713
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:22,159
progress you you learn

714
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:23,440
every like planet you you learn how to

715
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:26,000
use this unit it's like

716
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:27,279
kind of between a tutorial and and a

717
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,440
single player

718
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:30,960
experience is not as good as like

719
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:34,080
something with this story

720
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:35,840
but you can have fun here and there are

721
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:37,360
like bonus missions you can do it on

722
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:40,480
hard difficulty which

723
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:42,879
is quite difficult and and

724
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:44,640
it works this is single player people

725
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,679
can play it at home before they are

726
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:49,120
getting shredded by

727
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:49,120
the pros in multiplayer

728
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:57,440
and there's luck which is basically that

729
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:59,520
we needed trailers and for trailers

730
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:00,480
you sometimes just need the right people

731
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:02,480
i think that

732
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:07,840
sound is kind of not very good here

733
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:07,840
right or do we

734
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:13,679
okay we will see because i'll just show

735
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,159
you the trailer and if you don't hear

736
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:21,840
anything

737
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:26,159
then i'll try to narrate it

738
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:26,158
oh i'm muted yes

739
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:32,399
gave me a second and yeah i'm muted

740
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:36,720
i'm not united

741
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:43,120
i don't hear anything i think it's

742
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:43,120
trying to go through

743
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:52,559
yeah i will see if i can change it

744
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:52,879
ah here give me a second you can try to

745
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:55,200
use

746
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:57,360
this but i don't think it's going to

747
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,360
work

748
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:03,840
no no i think

749
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,480
this last match for today is going to be

750
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:14,320
between diaphragm is on

751
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:15,600
hide and seek diamond throwing going for

752
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,158
the cloaky white factory holiday is

753
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:18,959
going for

754
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:22,159
the shield line factory we have cast the

755
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:22,159
cast terrorism yes

756
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:30,000
23 bandits compared to 17 blades

757
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:40,799
we have terraforming we're like almost

758
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:45,410
the only game that i know that

759
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:53,260
has pathfinding with their forming

760
00:28:45,410 --> 00:28:53,260
[Music]

761
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:00,080
attack over the north again so that's

762
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,279
distraction

763
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:03,199
i mean obviously the real play is this

764
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:04,159
northern attack it hasn't started not

765
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,760
gonna be up in time

766
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:07,360
it's gonna take 27 seconds he's going to

767
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:08,720
be here at five and i like this

768
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:10,158
diaper setting one blade over the

769
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:11,520
northeast to see what's there just

770
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:27,840
double check without sending the entire

771
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:27,840
army there to die

772
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:34,869
[Music]

773
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:42,689
[Music]

774
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:58,799
anyway this spring aha

775
00:29:55,360 --> 00:30:00,719
anyway so there are things you cannot

776
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:03,200
always plan for like that you will have

777
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:04,559
people as talented as dyn friend and and

778
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:08,399
spring that will do this

779
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:10,158
trailer um and um but it works and it

780
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:10,959
showed like the new ui which is

781
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:14,320
important

782
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:17,600
and before the steam release we did um

783
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:20,559
a smaller release on each dot io

784
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:22,399
anyone here doesn't know it's it's a

785
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:25,600
smaller platform for

786
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:26,399
publishing games um much much more

787
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:29,199
limited

788
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:31,199
and it was kind of trying whether you

789
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,520
know people can download it and run it

790
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:35,120
and

791
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:36,080
not cry and there's like a smaller risk

792
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:38,000
because

793
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:39,840
you the reviews from there are not going

794
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,679
to be passed into steam so

795
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:43,439
it's just like a great opportunity for

796
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:46,720
feedback and knowing

797
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:49,440
what works so um

798
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:51,039
it works very nicely actually because we

799
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:54,159
worked for quite a while on

800
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:54,879
fixing everything um i didn't talk about

801
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:56,480
the

802
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:58,240
in-game lobby this is actually something

803
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:59,360
that i worked on a little bit not on the

804
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:02,320
lobby itself this

805
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:02,719
the lobby was um someone a guy up doing

806
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:05,120
but

807
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:06,240
like you needed to change and like have

808
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:08,399
another state

809
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,440
during uh you know scripting and then

810
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:12,239
there was like a

811
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:12,480
lot of fun stuff but uh everything kind

812
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:15,039
of

813
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:16,799
worked which was quite surprising and

814
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:18,080
then there was like the zero case team

815
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:21,120
lunch in april

816
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:24,480
2018 four years after

817
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:28,000
it was planned so these things took time

818
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:29,039
and and we really spent quite a bit on

819
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,200
it and and then like

820
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:32,480
we should ask ourselves whether it was a

821
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:35,120
success so

822
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:35,679
this is like the number of unique daily

823
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:38,959
users

824
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:42,080
and daily fest first time players

825
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:45,679
and well you can see that

826
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:48,320
the days after stem are

827
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:49,120
at least twice than like the all-time

828
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:51,279
peak

829
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:53,039
which is quite nice and this is what

830
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:55,919
2020 this is now

831
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:58,879
so we're already stabilized after the

832
00:31:55,919 --> 00:32:01,679
really really big peak in the beginning

833
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:04,159
one thing that's important we survived

834
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:07,120
um like the influx in the beginning

835
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:09,360
and then a week or two later i think it

836
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:12,158
was like the week after the release

837
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:13,519
that i made an error and and like uh

838
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:15,919
broke the server

839
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:16,880
during the weekend exactly when we were

840
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:19,440
supposed to like get

841
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:20,640
an even bigger pick so i'm sorry about

842
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:23,760
that

843
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:27,440
uh but doesn't matter we got managed to

844
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:29,760
get players and you know even though

845
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:31,919
we don't entirely know how many of the

846
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:33,840
people coming are all players because

847
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:35,600
sometimes people used to play see oh

848
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:37,199
this game on steam i liked it back in

849
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,840
the day let's go and have some games

850
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:40,880
more

851
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:44,320
so it's a bit hard to check but

852
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:45,840
in all in all i think this is nice

853
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:47,678
but the bigger question is about

854
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:49,840
retention um

855
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:51,360
because all these things that we change

856
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:53,439
we're supposed like

857
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:55,199
not to bring many people for the first

858
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:58,000
time you really want to see

859
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:58,480
whether more people left or less people

860
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,039
left

861
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:02,080
very fast like so retention graphs are a

862
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:05,200
bit weird

863
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:05,678
but in general i think there is a little

864
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,320
bit

865
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:09,519
of of better time this is like the

866
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:12,720
stimulus

867
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:13,200
so you're a little bit better attention

868
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:16,399
here

869
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:18,000
than let's say here and you know why

870
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:19,600
here their attention is bad because this

871
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,120
is when all the things were changing all

872
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:22,399
the time just before the release

873
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:25,360
and this is like the question when you

874
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:28,639
think was it worth it

875
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:30,559
um okay and and this is also a nice

876
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:33,760
measurement of success which

877
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:35,200
i think we have lots of user reviews and

878
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:37,440
they're quite positive

879
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:39,440
and i i think i've read each and every

880
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:41,279
one especially the bad ones

881
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:43,519
and it's it's really fun reading better

882
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:46,559
reviews you have the ones that are like

883
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:51,919
you they have good reasons and then

884
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:53,360
while like why is it not age of empires

885
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:58,559
and i'm like

886
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:58,559
well listen but uh yeah and

887
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:02,480
i should really probably stop reading

888
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:05,600
because it's a bit of

889
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:08,960
an obsession although it's fun

890
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:10,960
so let's talk about it was it a success

891
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:12,159
because when you work on something for

892
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:13,839
four years when

893
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:15,760
you know we didn't work on more

894
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:18,239
interesting features let's say

895
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,800
because we wanted the stimulus to work

896
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:21,279
so

897
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:22,800
first of all donations cover this cost

898
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:24,000
we get more donations which is nice

899
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:26,720
before that they didn't

900
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:28,960
cover service cost they even like they

901
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:30,879
covered their 0k server and then 0k

902
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:32,720
sent some money to spring to cover our

903
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:36,399
service which was nice

904
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:38,638
i had to ask though um

905
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:40,560
but it's getting maximum amount of

906
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:42,480
players really our goal

907
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:44,639
because maybe changing the game could

908
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:46,639
also get more players

909
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:48,240
in a similar manner because like there's

910
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:51,200
something very very charming

911
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:52,158
for me at least in having this die-hard

912
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:54,319
fan base

913
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:55,919
which is also why we have players for 10

914
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:57,359
years because they think this is the

915
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:58,799
best game they're not playing it because

916
00:34:57,359 --> 00:35:00,240
it's free they have money

917
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:02,480
they're just playing it because it's

918
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:05,520
like almost payload to them

919
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:06,720
and maybe maximum amount of players

920
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:10,880
isn't really needed

921
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:12,319
so maybe we want more exposure to get

922
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:14,880
more depths

923
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:15,440
i don't think we got even a single dev

924
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:17,760
from

925
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:19,599
steam i don't know maybe we did get a

926
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:22,640
little bit of contribution

927
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:23,760
but i know for sure that spring didn't

928
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:26,720
get anything

929
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:28,560
uh from from the stimulus do i think it

930
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:30,879
was a success i think it was like i

931
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:34,640
learned a lot i had fun

932
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:37,280
it was very very uh impressive uh

933
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:38,720
um i don't know well user-wise like

934
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:41,599
considering our goals

935
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:42,399
i think it was quite nice and but you

936
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:45,040
know

937
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:45,760
different people have different opinions

938
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:48,640
um

939
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:50,000
the aftermath the devs were burnt out

940
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:52,799
like a few months after

941
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,480
the release there was nothing nothing

942
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:57,359
being done

943
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:58,000
and then there was like all the talks

944
00:35:57,359 --> 00:35:59,839
about

945
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,520
whether stability is more important or

946
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:04,720
stability is more important

947
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:06,079
and when these are the same on paper but

948
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:09,279
they're not like

949
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:10,560
from the engine people guy like point of

950
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:12,720
view

951
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:13,680
the version of engine that was used in

952
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:18,240
0k had

953
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:20,879
bugs and we wanted them to like um

954
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:22,160
update but they didn't want to because

955
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:24,640
these were known bugs

956
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:25,520
who knows what new bugs are in the newer

957
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:28,000
versions

958
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:28,800
and and there were lots of arguments and

959
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,800
and like

960
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:33,200
trying to work out how to really you

961
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:34,079
know keep changing the engine and keep

962
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:37,200
using

963
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:40,000
a newer version um which you know

964
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:40,720
still goes to this day and what i think

965
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,000
we learned

966
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:47,598
um is minimize entities do you know mttf

967
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,160
it's a mean time to failure uh usually

968
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:52,000
no i

969
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:54,240
change it into mean time to fun um

970
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,200
like i said when you have user interface

971
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:57,359
or anything

972
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:59,040
you want the player from like the moment

973
00:36:57,359 --> 00:37:00,000
they started the exit into when they're

974
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:02,079
having fun

975
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,280
to be as short as possible like two

976
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:05,599
clicks fun

977
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:06,880
this is good if it's like i have to read

978
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:08,960
lots of stuff and i don't understand

979
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:10,640
what's going on not fun

980
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:12,560
this is about anything like tutorials

981
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:15,598
user interfaces buttons

982
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:17,520
anything also compromise like

983
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:19,200
the final version didn't entirely look

984
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:21,280
like what we expected

985
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:23,359
i gave an example the single player some

986
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:25,359
things that the engine planned

987
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:26,480
you know not of everything works and you

988
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:30,000
have to put like

989
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:33,280
the line okay we're releasing this what

990
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:34,960
and and we hope that it works and

991
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:36,400
and that's all question and this time

992
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:39,920
yeah

993
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:41,920
do we have time okay yes

994
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:43,599
i was just wondering because if it's a

995
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:46,960
question of genre or

996
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:47,680
like what's the link between spring or

997
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:50,160
0k

998
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:52,399
and supreme commander if there is one

999
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:54,799
yeah they were started being developed

1000
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:57,599
well not started but spring was started

1001
00:37:54,800 --> 00:38:00,800
before supreme commander

1002
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:02,839
was released and 0k i think also about

1003
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:05,359
this time

1004
00:38:02,839 --> 00:38:07,920
um

1005
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:10,078
they both like um drawing a lot from

1006
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:19,839
total annihilation so

1007
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:19,839
this is kind of hard to play

1008
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:36,800
yes we had we had a few oh we

1009
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:37,680
um i was asked whether we had media

1010
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:40,800
exposure

1011
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:44,399
um so 0k uh wasn't

1012
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:47,520
advertised on steam like evolution rts

1013
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:49,599
uh maybe it would have felt better but

1014
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:50,560
this doesn't matter we had some articles

1015
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:52,560
not in very big

1016
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:54,960
places there was actually more media

1017
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:57,520
exposure about 0k back in the days

1018
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:59,680
um like in game magazines we have people

1019
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:01,599
to this day that saw it in like a german

1020
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:03,359
game magazine that sent cds or something

1021
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:06,800
back

1022
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:06,799
things that i think disappeared

1023
00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:10,799
there was even one article that i have

1024
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:13,440
to tell you

1025
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:14,240
um it was about someone who tried to

1026
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:16,640
play it on

1027
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:17,919
like a gamepad or something an rts game

1028
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:21,200
i have no idea and they were

1029
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:22,000
quite frustrated and i know i can

1030
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:25,040
understand why

1031
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,599
anyway yes if you had to go back in time

1032
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:29,520
right now

1033
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:32,880
would you do would you do it again

1034
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:34,480
yes okay i was asked whether if i would

1035
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:37,520
go back in time i would uh

1036
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:38,720
do it again and yes like like we've

1037
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:41,280
learned a lot

1038
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:43,680
the product now is much better and we

1039
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:47,440
had fun and we didn't argue that much

1040
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:50,480
like it's good

1041
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:53,680
yes how many people are working on

1042
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:57,440
what is it on 0k

1043
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:59,040
um it's hard to tell oh sorry how many

1044
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:00,880
people are working on 0k

1045
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:02,320
it's hard to tell there are like a bunch

1046
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:05,359
of people kind of active

1047
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:07,920
it's in much slower development

1048
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:09,119
now than it was before really really

1049
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:10,319
hard to quantify but

1050
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:13,040
you know they are like regular

1051
00:40:10,319 --> 00:40:15,279
contributors doing things

1052
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:15,279
yes

1053
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:28,960
okay how do i see the future of

1054
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:32,319
um real-time strategy i don't know about

1055
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:32,319
the future but currently it's dead

1056
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:35,200
i hope this is

1057
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:41,440
i know like i i i say it is dead because

1058
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:43,680
just like from on observation of

1059
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:47,680
interest and what people want

1060
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:49,759
i don't agree that um things that like

1061
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:51,040
will magically be solved because there's

1062
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:53,520
a new game that solves

1063
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:55,119
no i don't think so like users know what

1064
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:58,400
they want and they want

1065
00:40:55,119 --> 00:41:01,839
dota or whatever yes there was one there

1066
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:03,440
and yes were there many forks of

1067
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:07,359
the spring engine or was it always a

1068
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:09,280
single version linearly

1069
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:12,720
okay i was asked if there were forks of

1070
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:16,240
spring there was one attempt at a fork

1071
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:18,399
but they um it was an in-engine

1072
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:20,000
like he was an engine developer he did

1073
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:21,760
lots of movie thread stuff

1074
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,760
that nobody could write and then like

1075
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:26,640
you had two versions of everything

1076
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:27,839
and it didn't go well and it was decided

1077
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:31,040
to remove this code

1078
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:32,960
so he got quite pissed

1079
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:34,400
like i understand him but then he went

1080
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:36,000
away and did the version without

1081
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:39,839
releasing his source code

1082
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:42,319
and like violating gpl so um

1083
00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:43,200
this uh didn't go very well because

1084
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:45,200
later it just

1085
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:48,879
it didn't keep up with our development

1086
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:52,879
and no game actually supports it

1087
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:52,880
and that's it do i have more time for

1088
00:41:55,319 --> 00:41:58,319
questions
