so i'm gonna do my best to give you

8
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,799
whatever i

9
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:27,119
i need to give you today about

10
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,080
typescript so my name is davey i'm a

11
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:32,159
software engineer

12
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:35,519
and i love javascript

13
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:35,519
you love javascript too right

14
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,160
if you love javascript you do this

15
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:46,239
now look around you if you hate

16
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:48,079
javascript you do this

17
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:49,839
now you can squeeze a little bit the

18
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:53,039
room for the people just

19
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:57,440
press them in the middle um and uh

20
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:59,199
okay so and i have a bold title so it

21
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:02,160
was a title to get you in the room so

22
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:04,399
it's i'm happy that you're all here

23
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,759
write save for javascript what does that

24
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,920
mean safer

25
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,880
all right so i'm just quickly gonna go

26
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,000
through

27
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:14,399
the agenda um we're just gonna

28
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,159
see javascript vs typescript getting to

29
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,680
love typescript and migrating from

30
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:19,520
javascript to typescript but

31
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:22,640
i need to answer this question first

32
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,640
what safer

33
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,840
means

34
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,600
undefined is not a function

35
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:42,640
say someone no bugs oh

36
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:46,880
i like that it's very ambitious man

37
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:48,880
i like that let's say again

38
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:51,439
easier debugging how many people here in

39
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:54,000
the room do javascript really

40
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:56,798
very good now keep your hands up how

41
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,799
about typescript

42
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,560
okay so i don't have to convince you

43
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,320
really i'm just going to make sure that

44
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,040
the end of the session when i say tab

45
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,798
script

46
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:07,119
everyone let raise their hands and they

47
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:10,000
want to do that every day

48
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:11,760
so yeah that's that's that's that's the

49
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,480
problem

50
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:16,399
you know that right cannot read property

51
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:19,840
bar often define

52
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:21,920
or null is not an object or

53
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,840
you're trying to call a function cannot

54
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,679
reproperty value often defined that's

55
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:28,260
really common

56
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,440
foo is not a function um

57
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:33,120
[Music]

58
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:35,040
cannot reproperty length of undefined

59
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,800
that's where that's that's the safer

60
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,640
part i'm talking about right i'm not

61
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,160
talking about security and all this

62
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,200
stuff i'm just talking about the fact

63
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:45,519
that you can

64
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:47,760
you can write code that doesn't crash um

65
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:49,040
in production so that's a runtimes error

66
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:52,640
right so we have

67
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:57,280
two things run times errors

68
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:58,720
and compile time errors right so while

69
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,720
you're writing your code

70
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,720
you you'll be able to see this with

71
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:06,720
typescript will

72
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:10,159
be able to detect that up front okay so

73
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,159
javascript vs typescript

74
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:16,840
javascript is yellow

75
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:19,519
you know that color right that's

76
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:22,560
javascript

77
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:22,560
tab script is blue

78
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:31,040
javascript is

79
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:32,000
whoever is doing javascript only in the

80
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:35,840
room is already

81
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:38,400
doing typescript okay

82
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,519
because typescript is a superset of

83
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,239
javascript

84
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:44,319
the way i introduce typescript to teams

85
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:46,319
that we coach

86
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:49,040
i told i tell them typescript is a

87
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:51,040
documentation tool

88
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,720
i'm gonna show you why i'm i'm calling

89
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:55,200
it the documentation tool yeah

90
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,959
it looks like a programming language but

91
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,920
as you start using it you're gonna

92
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:01,120
realize that

93
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:03,439
it is more documentation tools

94
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,599
than the programming language so that

95
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:07,280
yellow thing you already or all

96
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:08,720
all of you are doing it and the blue

97
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,560
part

98
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:13,120
is what typescript brings on top of the

99
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,080
table so yeah touchscript is a super set

100
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,760
of javascript

101
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,600
the way it's described on a microsoft

102
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:21,358
website is javascript

103
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:25,520
that scales okay

104
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:28,400
so small demo time

105
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,440
i'm just gonna take the a thing called

106
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:32,080
typescript

107
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,080
playgrounds

108
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,639
okay so you can follow up with you can

109
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:41,758
follow with me

110
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:45,360
on this one if you want

111
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:47,360
so um it's a small um

112
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,560
can you see this let me put it full

113
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,759
screen

114
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:53,520
so let me remove this so

115
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:55,440
keep in mind that what i'm about to show

116
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:58,960
you is the fact that

117
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:00,240
javascript typescript is a superset of

118
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:05,039
javascript

119
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:08,639
okay so in javascript we have class

120
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:09,199
let's say user as you can see on the

121
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:11,680
left

122
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:14,080
on the left here is typescript on the

123
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:16,080
right is javascript

124
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,758
the only difference between the two is

125
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:20,800
just to use tricked

126
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:21,680
so far so we're still in the the yellow

127
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,160
zone

128
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,720
everyone you write type script you're

129
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,039
doing

130
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,639
you're basically having 101 javascript

131
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:31,919
on the other side okay

132
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:34,560
that's the yellow zone and then um

133
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:35,120
you want to write to let's say a

134
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:39,840
variable

135
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:39,840
cost user

136
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:49,198
was still in the yellow zone right

137
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:52,479
so far so good so then

138
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:55,840
you will say what is user in typescript

139
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:57,360
you can express documentation you can

140
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:00,080
express

141
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,080
that user

142
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:08,639
is a user is of class

143
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,680
type user guess what i'm using type

144
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:13,120
right i'm using

145
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:14,319
this to to document that line i'm using

146
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:17,280
that class

147
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:19,120
i'm using a class but i'm going to show

148
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:21,440
you in a few seconds that you shouldn't

149
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:25,600
be doing it you shouldn't do that

150
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:28,400
but stay with me for a second

151
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:30,000
i'm still having a kind of 101 but i

152
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:32,960
don't have this anymore

153
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,039
i don't see this thing here that that

154
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:37,440
typing documentation

155
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:39,680
i'm just documenting my code but look

156
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:43,120
what's going to happen

157
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:49,840
here now i'm going to say um

158
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:49,840
user has a login which is a string

159
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,520
by hiding logging here right away here

160
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,960
this is this is

161
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:58,960
this isn't working anymore on the other

162
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:01,840
side we still have the same translation

163
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:05,359
but this this isn't working that won't

164
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:07,198
stop your program to work

165
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,960
but at least you see it right away

166
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:12,479
that's what we were talking about

167
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:14,400
compile time now if i want to fix it

168
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:17,440
i'm just gonna have to have to add a

169
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:22,239
login here that says davey

170
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:25,280
fix it we're still in the yellow zone

171
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:27,599
now i'm gonna take you to the blue zone

172
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,599
okay

173
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:35,759
why aren't you happy again

174
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,720
yeah it just asked me to give him a

175
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:39,280
default value

176
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,800
that's it that's what he wants which is

177
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,960
a good thing

178
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,319
now i'm gonna take you to the the blue

179
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:47,440
zone

180
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:48,800
instead of using a class i'm just gonna

181
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,560
use an interface

182
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,319
and then i don't need to if it's an

183
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,960
interface it's a contract

184
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:59,280
i don't need to initialize that anymore

185
00:07:54,960 --> 00:08:02,960
but look left and right

186
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:06,719
on the right i only have the cost

187
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:08,878
and on the left i have

188
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,720
i have this interface here on the left

189
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:13,280
and only the user

190
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,080
translation on the right see i use an

191
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:18,719
interface

192
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:20,560
to type my my uh my object

193
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,319
but i don't overload the final

194
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,960
javascript that is

195
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:26,319
rendered so the only thing i really did

196
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:31,359
right here

197
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:33,279
i documented this documentation

198
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:36,640
okay i'm gonna show you another example

199
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:40,000
of documentation that you can do

200
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:44,000
is to say i want the user to go

201
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:47,360
toward a certain direction okay

202
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,360
so right away you can see that

203
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,279
it's not happy because you just had a

204
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,640
property like you will do in javascript

205
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:55,120
and let me just hide that property

206
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:56,800
quickly oh well the property you just

207
00:08:55,120 --> 00:09:00,000
had has an impact

208
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:01,120
all the way in the chain because people

209
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,800
are using

210
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:05,200
or they don't expect that property but

211
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:10,240
you just had that and then in production

212
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:13,680
boom direction of whatever is undefined

213
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:17,600
okay but i want that that direction here

214
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:21,519
to come from a new or i can say

215
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:25,920
um enumeration let's say direction

216
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:25,920
okay so as you can see here

217
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:33,199
i had an enumeration and then right away

218
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:36,319
i have this magic happening here

219
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,959
this line that direct and then i will

220
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,200
just add

221
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:39,199
left

222
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:48,080
and and then right for example

223
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:48,880
okay so yeah there is a there is a one

224
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,600
on one

225
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:53,519
translation from enum to something that

226
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,040
looks like this

227
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:56,720
if you don't understand that part of the

228
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:59,279
cut it's okay

229
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,959
it's is it's just they're using some

230
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:02,640
closure to create a variable and then

231
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:03,359
they encapsulate the entire thing and

232
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,839
then that

233
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,360
that gives you a way to to assign a left

234
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:09,519
and right property on an object

235
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:12,959
dynamically

236
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:16,000
so now here i can say this thing

237
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:17,920
is a direction that it's a left

238
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,680
but i'm still having a problem here so

239
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:21,519
what i'm gonna do just to add the

240
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:24,800
direction property

241
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:27,680
and then say this one is a direction

242
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:30,000
is of type direction okay it's just an

243
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:32,319
enum

244
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,160
it's documentation here i'm expressing

245
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,920
the fact that you can go left and right

246
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:38,560
i could have used an object

247
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:40,079
const object direction and then left and

248
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:42,319
right that will have yield the same

249
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:45,359
result

250
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:48,320
but see how you can make it

251
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:50,720
much more appealing here just gonna say

252
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,720
cost

253
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:55,519
you see what happened there

254
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:04,640
it's all disappeared there is no more

255
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:06,399
overload of javascript

256
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:07,839
that you're gonna you're gonna give to

257
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:09,120
your customer because that's the part

258
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:11,760
your customer will use

259
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,800
in their app in the final app they run

260
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:16,240
but you

261
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:18,800
in your code you express

262
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,320
something to make the work of your team

263
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,920
easier

264
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,920
that's that's that's the message i want

265
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:27,120
to pass here the fact that

266
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:29,839
typescript is documentation we good so

267
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,839
far

268
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:35,279
so let me quickly go back here

269
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:40,640
so getting to love typescript

270
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:48,160
um i'm going to take

271
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:48,160
something quickly here for you

272
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:55,839
so i have this function set value

273
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:57,518
when i say set value i'm going to

274
00:11:55,839 --> 00:12:00,880
receive this value and i say if

275
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:04,480
value var real value and then value here

276
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,959
so if i call it can you can you all see

277
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:09,519
this

278
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:12,800
okay if i call set value

279
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:16,160
and i do this and then i say

280
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:19,199
um set value um

281
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:22,000
to be um

282
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:23,519
yeah here i actually need to say this

283
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,959
and then this that would probably be

284
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:28,000
much realistic

285
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:28,000
and then here i say

286
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:36,320
devi and then here i say

287
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:39,839
and number 12.

288
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,839
guess what is happening here

289
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:44,639
what do you think is gonna be yield here

290
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,639
on line nine

291
00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:03,040
yeah that doesn't work that won't work

292
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:04,720
yeah so see now we're already talking

293
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:07,279
about

294
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,959
the fact that hosting is gonna be in

295
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:10,399
into play here it's gonna enter into

296
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:13,839
play here

297
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:15,839
right so there is already kind of

298
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:17,920
understanding javascript but as well

299
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:20,560
understanding the fact that

300
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:23,040
are we going to enter here is this code

301
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:26,719
is written in a sense like

302
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:29,920
this can enter here first line

303
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:32,639
nine is it going to enter here

304
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:35,120
no and then the two two other cases will

305
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:39,600
enter but regardless we're going to have

306
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:39,600
undefined here and then

307
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:45,839
dv and then 12. okay but that

308
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:47,439
i'm gonna have to open the code source

309
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:48,000
and then start making sense of what

310
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:51,120
you're trying

311
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:54,560
to do i can make it

312
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:56,959
much easier by saying

313
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,959
value

314
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:07,120
could be either a string

315
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:10,240
or number

316
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:13,519
see by doing those these two already

317
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:17,360
are solved but how about this part

318
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:20,560
i can communicate via documentation

319
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:25,360
that this part is sometime

320
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:29,279
optional i'm just documenting my code

321
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:32,480
that's all i'm doing okay

322
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:34,240
so once you you reach that part there's

323
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,720
some magic that's gonna happen here and

324
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,440
then

325
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:39,120
yeah you can use a good let here that

326
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,160
will make your life much easier but if

327
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,399
you do so

328
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:44,240
you see the scope gonna enter and play

329
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:45,680
and that's not typescript that is just

330
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:48,240
raw javascript

331
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:50,959
so let me just move it here then it

332
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,959
doesn't crash

333
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:58,480
and then i can i can set the value

334
00:14:54,880 --> 00:15:00,720
right here okay

335
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,800
now it's not over because i still need

336
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:05,040
to do something that looks like

337
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:06,399
what is the possible return value

338
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,839
because if you give me a string or

339
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:11,839
number

340
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:14,480
i can also have as return value a string

341
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:14,480
and a number

342
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:21,839
i'm just expressing what my code

343
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:23,760
is supposed to do but here is the thing

344
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:27,040
the day the day i discover what i'm

345
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:28,639
about to show you i discovered that in

346
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:30,639
touchscript and i was like

347
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:32,560
there is no way i'm doing javascript

348
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:35,040
again

349
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:36,959
i'm gonna show you that line of code i

350
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:40,480
was here and i said value

351
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:42,479
dot because i already said string or

352
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:45,680
number

353
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:50,320
when i say value dot i only get

354
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:53,680
to string or value right

355
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:57,199
but then one step further i realize that

356
00:15:53,680 --> 00:16:00,399
if i have an if condition like this one

357
00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:04,240
and i can say type of

358
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:07,360
value is equal

359
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:12,560
let's say string now

360
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:12,560
inside here when i say value dot

361
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:23,120
that at this moment my brain just did

362
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:25,839
there is no way you're not doing

363
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:28,880
typescript uh in your life

364
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:31,120
just that because

365
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:32,000
just with that all the screen has shown

366
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,759
you

367
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,120
function doesn't exist and what have

368
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:40,160
disappeared entirely

369
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,560
yeah some some cases won't work entirely

370
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,800
but

371
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:44,160
this gives you what i'm trying to show

372
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:46,319
you okay

373
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,199
so i can go much further i'm happy to

374
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:50,880
talk about it

375
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:54,880
right after so what i'm saying here

376
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:54,880
typescript is a documentation tool

377
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:59,680
it is a documentation tool so the next

378
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:03,199
question will be

379
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:04,000
if you had if you have a huge javascript

380
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:07,280
project how can

381
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:11,599
you go from javascript to typescript

382
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:14,639
there are three steps three

383
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:17,839
the first one is super easy

384
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:19,280
just make it work you know what i mean

385
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:23,918
here

386
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:27,199
you take you generate a ts config file

387
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:28,640
ts config which is a typescript

388
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:32,000
configuration

389
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:34,240
and then you add set

390
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,440
implicit any which is just a property in

391
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:38,640
your ts config

392
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:40,240
you just put it at false

393
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,160
what does that mean it means any

394
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,200
javascript it just make sure that you're

395
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:46,000
still in the

396
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,880
yellow zone right that's it that's all

397
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,120
it does

398
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:50,880
it doesn't yell at you but typescript is

399
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:53,199
already there

400
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,000
so you're still in your javascript

401
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,240
project

402
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,120
not typescript that script is just

403
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:00,880
behind

404
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:04,159
watching everything at first then

405
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:07,679
you rename all your js file to

406
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:08,320
ts or tsx if you're using a react and

407
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:11,600
then

408
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:13,439
pre-act and all this tool that's it

409
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:15,360
don't don't don't force that onto your

410
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:19,360
team just just do this

411
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:19,360
they won't they won't see it yeah

412
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:23,120
they will see the ts thing right but for

413
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,720
them

414
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,879
that won't really change in terms of the

415
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:31,280
code they write every day

416
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:34,480
right that's one step second one

417
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:34,480
now be explicit

418
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:40,799
don't turn the any

419
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:43,200
to instead instead of first put it that

420
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:46,080
true you know what's going to happen

421
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:47,200
it will just put some red line between

422
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:50,399
the things that are

423
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:53,520
that don't have types that's it

424
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:56,480
that's all it's going to do

425
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:57,600
everything is still okay all right you

426
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,799
can put that on your team

427
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,799
they'll be they'll be okay they will

428
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:03,679
just be like we we have new red

429
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:05,200
flags what is happening here then you

430
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:08,000
tell them

431
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:09,039
let's just take all the the types the

432
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,360
command types

433
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:12,960
like if you're on a node project just do

434
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:16,320
a npm install

435
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:18,080
at type node just do that

436
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:20,320
this is a common type it's they're all

437
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:23,120
known once they're in your project

438
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:23,760
most of the red thing will will just

439
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,399
vanish

440
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,960
because it will recognize that no typing

441
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,840
or it's

442
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,880
it's there that's it well don't do that

443
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,720
in two days just

444
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:34,400
you do the first step then you wait

445
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:37,760
three months then you do

446
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:41,679
this part okay and then

447
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:43,440
you add typing for third-party tools

448
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:46,000
like a library you're using and stuff

449
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:49,520
like that you have typing for that

450
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:51,919
okay now that part

451
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:53,039
you should leave that for a few months

452
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:55,120
i'm not kidding

453
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:58,000
because the third part is where you get

454
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:58,000
you get into war

455
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:05,360
the third part is be straight means that

456
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:06,720
you just go in the the typescript config

457
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:10,719
file and then you put

458
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:12,400
strict to true so what does that mean it

459
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:15,440
means that

460
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:17,280
your project isn't working anymore

461
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:19,120
it just means that now we're gonna have

462
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:22,720
to type everything you're gonna have to

463
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:26,639
express every single line of code

464
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:29,600
in your application that's what it means

465
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:30,080
okay i want i i have i have a repo for

466
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,080
you

467
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:33,520
i have a repo for you where i have those

468
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:37,120
three steps it's in the

469
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:37,600
resource part and um you can just take

470
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:40,639
the

471
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:43,918
three steps okay with that

472
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:46,000
i hope that you'll be able to play with

473
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:48,320
touchscript a little bit more

474
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,120
i'm gonna be outside answering questions

475
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:51,200
if you want to

476
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:52,239
to drink typescript i'll be here if you

477
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,159
want to

478
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:56,240
think typescript with react i'm gonna

479
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:58,720
help touchscript with vue.js

480
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:00,400
i'm gonna help i know those things

481
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,919
typescript with angular i'm not

482
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:04,640
i'm not gonna help because it's already

483
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:16,480
there so just go and do it

484
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:18,159
and voila questions

485
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:21,039
one question of the day is someone at

486
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:21,039
the back of the room

487
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:31,840
who had the question

488
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:36,480
hi uh thank you for your presentation

489
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,240
yeah

490
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:40,559
i would like to know there is a lot of

491
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:43,919
libraries that don't have types for

492
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:44,639
uh for type for typescript so i would

493
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:47,360
like to know

494
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:49,039
how you can generate this or uh yeah so

495
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:51,678
you have you have a

496
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:53,600
tools that can basically scan those

497
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:56,320
those um

498
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:58,399
library and then generate generics

499
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:59,120
typing for them that's gonna facilitate

500
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:02,880
the work

501
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:06,559
but you have a um on github there is a

502
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:08,400
github repo and

503
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:10,879
define type something like that where

504
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:15,039
you're gonna mostly find

505
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:18,640
whatever you need in 2012 1314

506
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:21,200
that typescript was a nightmare

507
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:23,200
guess what today it's it's top of the

508
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:25,600
game on top of the game literally

509
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:27,440
from the react team to the view team

510
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:30,480
they all use that

511
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:32,240
to write safer code today

512
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:34,559
but you have to that can generate types

513
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,559
for you

514
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:42,960
it's recorded but we don't know your

515
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,959
name just your voice

516
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:47,360
so exit is this way if you are in russia

517
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:55,840
