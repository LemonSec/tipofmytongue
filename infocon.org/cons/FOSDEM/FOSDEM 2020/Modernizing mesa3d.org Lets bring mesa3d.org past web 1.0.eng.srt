1
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,920
all right i guess we can just get

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:13,360
started

3
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:13,360
so hi again it's me again

4
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:20,400
uh when i'm

5
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:21,759
not working on uh so i like to work on

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,560
pretty technical stuff but

7
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,519
every now and then uh i need some

8
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,439
lighter work

9
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:29,359
to do so one of the things that uh one

10
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:30,960
of my kind of pet projects

11
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:32,399
to work on when i when my brain is

12
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,760
hurting is

13
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,640
to look into trying to get the mesa

14
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:40,399
website

15
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:42,559
uh make it a little bit better than what

16
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:45,200
it is now

17
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:47,440
so this is not meant to be a talk this

18
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:50,320
is meant to be just a kind of a

19
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:51,680
discussion uh but i have a little bit of

20
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,520
a

21
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,719
presentation to begin with to kind of

22
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,600
like

23
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:59,280
uh present my view of things and what

24
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,160
what can be done better and

25
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,879
have some proposals and stuff like that

26
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,560
so

27
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:08,320
yeah so for the first

28
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:12,400
thing to talk about is what's what's

29
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:15,600
wrong with mesa 3d.org right now

30
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:18,479
it's it's a pretty old website uh

31
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,280
it was written yeah 15 years ago kind of

32
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:22,320
the

33
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:25,200
current version of the of the web

34
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,758
part of it not necessarily the content

35
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,840
uh

36
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:33,040
it's like written in html4.401

37
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,720
it's uh mobile phones didn't have

38
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,720
browsers back then if you ever like try

39
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,240
to go to mesa3d.org on your phone to

40
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,039
kind of read some documentation maybe

41
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:42,399
while you're

42
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:44,720
on the train it's it's not fun uh

43
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:45,759
this is kind of what started my chair i

44
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,200
kind of like

45
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:49,280
wanted to check some stuff while i was

46
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:53,600
on the bus and yeah

47
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:55,280
it wasn't wasn't very fun

48
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,960
so now we're 15 years later and the

49
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:00,079
world has changed quite a bit

50
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:02,960
uh we have html5 now and

51
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:04,320
translating kind of the mesa website is

52
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:08,239
to that is a little bit

53
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:09,598
of a pain we have better markup

54
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:12,000
languages and tools for

55
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:14,000
for dealing with this maybe some of this

56
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,280
was already around back then but

57
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:21,599
not quite as popular and adapted

58
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:25,680
we have static site generators and

59
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:28,000
lab pages and gitlab ci and stuff like

60
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:31,280
that and on freedesktop.org

61
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,239
that we can use and i think kind of the

62
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,400
thing that

63
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:35,680
whenever i digs into this bothers me the

64
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,760
most is that we're kind of like

65
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:40,000
like thrown all of the web presence

66
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:42,640
stuff on mesa into one bucket

67
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,080
uh and kind of stirred it around and

68
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:46,319
we're getting like a

69
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,000
website that's uh kind of a jack of all

70
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:51,440
trades master of none

71
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,640
uh it's it's not a great home page like

72
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,440
if you want to read about message it's

73
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,200
kind of like

74
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:57,440
off-putting you don't like you have to

75
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:00,720
dig for the right information

76
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:03,040
uh as a documentation this documentation

77
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,959
is kind of bad because you have to

78
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,720
like if you're reading the intri stuff

79
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,480
you have to

80
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,159
open it in a browser to read it in a

81
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:13,599
reasonable way the

82
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:16,319
raw html isn't fun to read we keep

83
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:16,799
updating it with the broken html stuff

84
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:20,640
because

85
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:22,879
you know html is hard um

86
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,720
yeah and the then you know the releases

87
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:26,319
are just kind of like in a subfolder on

88
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,720
the same site

89
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:29,760
uh there and uh you know you don't get

90
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:33,359
any any good

91
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:36,480
uh cdn or distributions around the

92
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:38,000
world for the releases either

93
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,920
so it's kind of like it's not it's not

94
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,799
great at either either of the things

95
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,920
so uh my proposal is to split it in

96
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:47,040
three

97
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:50,879
uh into three different sites uh one is

98
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:52,159
the home page that would be mesa3d.org

99
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:54,000
this is where you go to kind of read

100
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:56,720
about the project

101
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,439
uh it should be built i think using a

102
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,000
static

103
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:01,680
site generator like jekyll or hugo or

104
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,560
you know it's not really important

105
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,439
just the important bit is that it's easy

106
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,799
i think to

107
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:10,720
read and edit and work on

108
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:12,319
it should probably live in a separate

109
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:15,200
repository from the

110
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:17,199
from the website because i think the

111
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:20,320
home page shouldn't really contain

112
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:21,120
uh things that pertain to the source

113
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,440
code

114
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,240
that's that's for the documentation and

115
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,719
for

116
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,240
for what you get when once you download

117
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,160
the source code

118
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,600
it should contain stuff like where do

119
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,960
you download it where do you

120
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:37,199
like you know go for file filing issues

121
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:40,400
uh where do you read documentation yeah

122
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:40,400
like all of these things

123
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,880
then the documentation uh i suggest

124
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,060
having as a separate

125
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:49,600
site something like docs.nasa3d.org

126
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:53,120
[Music]

127
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:55,520
we should build this using a from ci

128
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,880
from the master branch or release branch

129
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,919
of mesa

130
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:03,600
using sphinx or git book or one of those

131
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:05,359
more modern documentation tools

132
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,800
this means that we can actually read the

133
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,919
entry sources

134
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:12,800
in a reasonable way on a yeah human

135
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:16,080
readable market format

136
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,280
and uh yeah releases i don't really have

137
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:22,000
a great

138
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:22,000
answer to uh it's a little bit of a pain

139
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:26,159
um

140
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,520
git lab pages where which we ideally i

141
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,520
think want to move the website

142
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,359
into being hosted at uh doesn't deal

143
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:33,840
great with a large set of

144
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,639
static binary files uh you have to

145
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,400
upload them

146
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:38,000
for every build of the site you have to

147
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:41,120
copy them into the

148
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,120
into the sets of stuff and yeah

149
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,240
so i'm wondering if we should have like

150
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,280
just keep a

151
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:50,639
separate uh web server instance

152
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:54,239
running and uh use some reverse proxy to

153
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:56,720
uh to put it in the right space or we

154
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,680
move like stop uploading where we upload

155
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,800
and and

156
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:04,000
you know up move to somewhere else

157
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:06,240
the problem with moving is that we

158
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,120
don't want to break links we don't want

159
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:11,520
to break

160
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:13,520
current build scripts so uh so

161
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:17,520
i think we need to at least for some

162
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:22,479
time live with a reverse proxy on top to

163
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:25,120
to get the links just to keep working

164
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:26,800
uh yeah so the benefits here are that we

165
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,639
can now

166
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,960
once we split it like this we can build

167
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:33,840
a kind of flashy marketing site

168
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:35,359
uh or like uh for the home page where

169
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:38,080
you can like read about the project

170
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,440
kind of uh stuff like that and it can be

171
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,880
like a practical

172
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,280
you can have a practical and clean

173
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:45,600
documentation site so you kind of like

174
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:47,440
separate between what's what's like

175
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,039
attention grabbing and what's kind of

176
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:52,319
like

177
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:55,440
pushing the information kind of uh

178
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:56,639
first and foremost yeah and then we

179
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,319
kind of get away from the whole

180
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:00,960
jack-of-all-trades master of namjoon

181
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:04,639
onions that i think we currently do

182
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:08,080
uh we can yeah edit uh the documents

183
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:11,120
uh in like some same uh

184
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:13,120
markup language instead of raw html uh

185
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,960
and right now we have the same html

186
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:17,280
boilerplate repeated in every document

187
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:19,280
so if you ever want to change

188
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,799
a detail about that boilerplate right

189
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:23,280
now

190
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:25,199
yeah it's it's not great it's super

191
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:28,799
painful

192
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:30,479
and i think we can the last point here

193
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,440
is like i think we we can move to

194
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:33,440
something that's

195
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:35,360
a little bit less opaque because right

196
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:38,400
now it's not really obvious to

197
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:40,720
figure out how to uh

198
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,318
how to change the website like yes

199
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,520
there's documentation it's all in the

200
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:45,759
tree there you can submit

201
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,960
patches but it's not really documented

202
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:48,879
on the website you don't know

203
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,239
like if you go to mesa 3. you have no

204
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:52,080
idea that this is actually the docs

205
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:56,840
folder of the website

206
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:59,840
uh so we could put like an edit this

207
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,840
page

208
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:10,080
for instance there's more i think we can

209
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:13,599
work more on

210
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:17,120
this process there

211
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:19,840
uh so here's my proposal for a new

212
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:22,720
homepage so i've built this

213
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,919
site this is kind of what it looks like

214
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:27,840
uh

215
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:30,479
it's it's not not a fantastic web

216
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,440
website but it's it's kind of what i was

217
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:34,880
able to

218
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:36,559
cover together um it's built using

219
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:39,200
jekyll and bootstrap

220
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:40,079
and i made a custom like so it's not

221
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,519
using any of the

222
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,360
kind of built-in themes because i wanted

223
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:44,399
to have a little bit of familiarity with

224
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,839
the old

225
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:47,200
website so you kind of like recognize a

226
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:48,080
little bit that you're at the mesa

227
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,320
website so

228
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,519
the little gears in the corner there and

229
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,480
uh and like a

230
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:55,760
dark header with a with a white uh

231
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:59,440
background

232
00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:00,640
um it's mobile friendly i don't show

233
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,800
this here but it's

234
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:04,880
it's it reads uh like works really

235
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:08,719
nicely on phones

236
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:12,080
uh it builds fro builds html on the ci

237
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:14,240
using git lab pages and uh

238
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:16,480
yeah it contains all the the kind of the

239
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,720
static parts about mesa so stuff that it

240
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:21,760
doesn't change with every release

241
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:25,440
um yeah and it also provides

242
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:27,360
yeah me in the news are actually

243
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,200
like if you go to mesa 3. right now you

244
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,680
get all news since the beginning of time

245
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,000
in one

246
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:34,079
long page this actually gives you just

247
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
like the latest ones there's a page

248
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,279
there's a link here to reading all of

249
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,160
the news and that's a

250
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:41,839
paginated page so you get like 10 news

251
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:45,519
entries at the time and

252
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:49,040
you don't have to load uh stuff from

253
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:52,880
the mid 90s and stuff there

254
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,880
the gears turn if you hover them

255
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,080
so yeah

256
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:02,319
so yeah so this is kind of my proposal

257
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:05,199
for the website here's kind of my

258
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:07,680
proposals for the doc site

259
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,279
this is this builds uh the documentation

260
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,000
so this converts the documentation to

261
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:13,600
sphinx

262
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,200
and uh and it's uh yeah

263
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,920
the link is actually the wrong one i'm

264
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,240
sorry they should just remove intro.html

265
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,640
i

266
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,000
changed that since i wrote the slides

267
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:24,319
this effort was started by

268
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,240
laura abbott she wrote some scripts to

269
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:29,200
automatically convert i've

270
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,800
updated them a bit and fixed up some

271
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:33,760
things

272
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:35,920
when she worked on it she was trying to

273
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:40,000
replace the whole nasa 3d website

274
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:42,079
with this sphinx site um

275
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,279
i wasn't a big fan of that particular

276
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:45,599
because of the

277
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:46,320
news so there's two things one is that

278
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,320
she

279
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:51,040
like branding of the website was kind of

280
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:53,920
important when when it's the website

281
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:55,360
uh so she like there was some debate

282
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,120
back and forth about making a proper

283
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:59,040
mess of the logo and stuff like that and

284
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:02,720
i kind of

285
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:07,199
uh this gets very opinionated and

286
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:11,279
people yeah have different ideas um

287
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,920
and uh sphynx doesn't handle pagination

288
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:16,240
at all

289
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:19,279
so the new site the news page was still

290
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,600
like miles long scroll forever uh kind

291
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:22,640
of

292
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:24,640
thing so and uh

293
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,000
as far as i could see i tried for a

294
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,519
while to find something for

295
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,680
sphinx for this it doesn't really seem

296
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:31,600
to exist i guess i could have patched it

297
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:34,880
but

298
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,880
i thought just the correction

299
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:47,040
yeah yeah you're right my bad yes

300
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,399
yes yes you're right my fault my

301
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:51,120
apologies to

302
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:52,079
to both of them for getting the wrong

303
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,480
person there

304
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,479
um

305
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:58,959
yeah so yeah this also does like the ci

306
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:02,240
dance to convert stuff

307
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:04,638
uh as a kind of nice

308
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:07,440
added benefit we could move it to to

309
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:09,120
host the stuff on the read the docs.org

310
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,279
infrastructure they have some nice

311
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,320
bells and whistles where you can where

312
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:14,160
you can have

313
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,320
multiple versions of the docs so you can

314
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,040
actually check the version of the ducks

315
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,680
that matches

316
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:21,040
the version of mesa you have this is

317
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,800
interesting kind of because

318
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,480
you sometimes change the environment

319
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,479
variables and if you're stuck on like an

320
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:29,760
lts release of something

321
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:32,639
it's kind of annoying if the wrong

322
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,639
information is there

323
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:41,199
yeah and then finally for releases

324
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:42,480
yeah that's the the current situation is

325
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:46,079
that we're hosting these

326
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:47,440
releases in three different urls uh one

327
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:49,359
over https

328
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:51,360
so the nice thing is that it seems we

329
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,000
have almost forever advertised the top

330
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,360
link and

331
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,680
the top two ones only so none of these

332
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,360
are

333
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:59,359
under or none of the first two ones are

334
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:01,200
under domain repo so

335
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,880
maybe we're lucky and no one actually

336
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:05,440
has a script where it downloads it from

337
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:08,720
that unadvertised meso3d.org

338
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:10,720
archive link which is what

339
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:12,480
requires the reverse proxy thing i

340
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:15,519
talked about before

341
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,880
uh this needs some i think we need to do

342
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:18,880
some logging and stuff to figure out if

343
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:22,720
that is the case or not

344
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:24,240
um yeah and changing it as i said before

345
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:28,079
will uh

346
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:30,880
will uh break these urls if we move it

347
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:32,399
so my best proposal i think right now is

348
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:35,519
just to kind of

349
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:39,519
yeah keep it at uh

350
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:42,079
well keep it there and but rever uh like

351
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:43,600
reverse proxy this url and have that

352
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:46,399
hosted separately

353
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:48,480
from the gitlab pages so we keep the old

354
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:50,000
website but kind of delete the page and

355
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:53,279
do some redirects there and

356
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,279
uh it's easy

357
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,839
we could also use a proper cdn but i'm

358
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:59,760
not really sure

359
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:02,079
if we care about that because i think

360
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,360
most people use distro packages for mesa

361
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:06,399
so we don't really

362
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:08,399
have a huge load i think

363
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:10,399
but both the kernel and gnome has proper

364
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:12,240
cdn so we could also maybe piggyback on

365
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:15,360
those kind of just start

366
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:16,000
going there i'm getting a signal that is

367
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:20,160
15 minutes left

368
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:24,399
i don't think that's true all right um

369
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:26,639
yeah so this is um this is pretty much

370
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:27,440
all i have and now i want to hear if

371
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:30,880
anyone has

372
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:32,000
any ideas or our suggestions on how we

373
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:34,480
can improve this

374
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,480
yeah sure

375
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:48,079
the problem to me is not so much the

376
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:49,680
html for whatever page the problem is

377
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:52,638
more of the content

378
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:53,839
so the the content is really not geared

379
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:55,440
toward

380
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:57,040
people who aren't familiar with the

381
00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:00,160
topic

382
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:02,959
that's really the more urgent thing to

383
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:04,800
really make it uh that people can

384
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:06,399
contribute like when they can start

385
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,800
contributing to measure because

386
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:11,920
currently i think the wrap-up is

387
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:13,519
huge right so uh

388
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:15,040
what what he's saying if someone didn't

389
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:18,079
hear is that uh the

390
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,800
problem right now for many people are or

391
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:20,160
at least

392
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:22,240
were for you when you got introduced to

393
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:25,760
mesa was not so much the

394
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:28,639
packaging but more of the content and

395
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,959
i agree that the content isn't great but

396
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:31,279
i

397
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:32,638
hope that making this into a easier to

398
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:34,399
edit format will

399
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:36,560
make it a little bit less painful and

400
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:39,680
kind of will incentivize people to

401
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:41,518
keep things more up to date but that

402
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:44,000
remains to be seen i think

403
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:45,440
i i think it's hard to say that that's

404
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,000
definitely going to happen but

405
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,000
i hope so

406
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:54,639
this is not the first time we see such

407
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:57,519
e-port or such try

408
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:59,519
and definitely i think it's not the last

409
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:02,720
how exactly are we going to pursue to

410
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:06,320
get forum this time to make this happen

411
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:07,519
well so um so yeah so if someone i think

412
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:10,880
everyone heard that

413
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:11,519
uh yeah so so how we get this to happen

414
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:14,720
i think

415
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:16,959
um i'm not

416
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,880
so i'm the only one like i'm working on

417
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:22,239
this kind of alone but i'm i'm

418
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:25,680
uh kind of a little bit uh

419
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,680
talking with some other free desktop

420
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:29,279
admins and stuff on the side so i think

421
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:31,839
there's

422
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:33,519
there's more people who want this and i

423
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:35,360
think

424
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:37,920
i i think we just at some point need to

425
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:39,839
make a community decision and kind of

426
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:43,199
move forward

427
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:45,920
and i think i hope

428
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:46,479
that this is like what i'm presenting

429
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:50,319
here is

430
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:52,959
is enough to move forward but uh but

431
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:54,000
i wanna of course have everyone be able

432
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:56,399
to see what they think

433
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,079
i say what they think about it first i

434
00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:00,320
don't break anything for anyone

435
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:01,199
um so i've been following that for a bit

436
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,360
as well and

437
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:05,039
i think everybody agrees on the idea of

438
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,400
doing that

439
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:08,640
basically the only thing that was

440
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,520
preventing it was the technical issue of

441
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,480
the archive

442
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:13,199
and how to actually keep providing the

443
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:16,400
troubles

444
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:18,880
without breaking the road for everyone

445
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:20,640
that was pretty much the last issue once

446
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,959
we figured out some good solutions for

447
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,199
that

448
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:24,079
i think everybody agrees on how to

449
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:27,360
actually do

450
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:28,720
the rest yeah and just to fill in on

451
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:32,000
that

452
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:32,400
the free desktop admins that i'm talking

453
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,600
to

454
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,880
mostly daniel stone is really not happy

455
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:39,360
about the idea of having

456
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:40,240
having to maintain a reverse proxy for a

457
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:43,039
long time

458
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,760
i totally understand that but i think

459
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:45,840
right now

460
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:47,600
kind of the situation is kind of similar

461
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:51,039
anyway because there's already

462
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:52,159
a reverse proxy for uh for for this i

463
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:53,039
think it's mostly a matter of

464
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,120
reconfiguring

465
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:56,559
what we have and kind of turn on some

466
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,439
logging and kind of make sure that we

467
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:59,360
know if

468
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,480
someone keeps using these old urls and

469
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:02,399
maybe we can turn it off

470
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,840
a couple of years down the line the

471
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,160
kernel

472
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:08,559
the kernel moved all their releases with

473
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:10,640
i think six months notice and just

474
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:12,960
removed the old urls and the world

475
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:14,880
survived

476
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,640
we could also just say it's not that

477
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:19,200
important like people have some

478
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,919
some time for themselves i don't know

479
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,240
since you

480
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:23,919
use bitlab now can you use the pipeline

481
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,200
to generate the files and just drop it

482
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:28,480
there at the current

483
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:30,559
location uh we could yes

484
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:33,760
we could no reverse proxy extra needed

485
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:33,760
and just have it built

486
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,840
yes

487
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:00,639
so um so the goal is kind of to find a

488
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:02,320
way to avoid having to

489
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:04,160
deal with this but yes we could have uh

490
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:07,520
we could untangle these things and

491
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:07,520
solve one problem at the time

492
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:11,280
i think this is a good excuse for trying

493
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:14,320
to solve both though but

494
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:15,440
maybe not so

495
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:18,000
i was going to say something similar to

496
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:20,960
what he was saying about the

497
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,919
like beginners getting started and you

498
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:24,080
showed a shot of your

499
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:25,679
home page which did seem to fall into

500
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,559
the same trap that i found a lot of

501
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:28,480
websites

502
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:29,840
do like for example when russ changed

503
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,360
their home page one of the major

504
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:33,840
criticisms was

505
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:35,360
before it was like you got there and the

506
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,720
first thing you saw was

507
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:38,320
a piece of rust curve showing you

508
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,880
exactly what it did what the advantages

509
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,480
were

510
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,960
and then now they've changed it it's

511
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:44,000
basically become almost for managers

512
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,640
saying just like

513
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:49,520
it's better it's faster use it but it

514
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:52,080
doesn't actually say anything

515
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:53,120
and yours as well there had like a basic

516
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:56,399
introduction and

517
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:59,760
latest news so i yeah i think

518
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:03,120
uh so i'm gonna just pull up the uh

519
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:03,120
the site here so i can uh

520
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:08,158
uh

521
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:11,199
 um i don't i'm not on any sort of

522
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:11,200
wi-fi here i guess

523
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:23,440
yeah so um

524
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,959
where to get started not like a lot of

525
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,320
people like oh you're on the homepage

526
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:28,000
and tells you like where you can file

527
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:29,200
issues and do all this and this but your

528
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,720
brand new user

529
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,320
you're not gonna want to do all that

530
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:48,480
stuff

531
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:50,799
yeah so i i i

532
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,159
show kind of like which apis are there

533
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:53,918
and stuff like that i'm

534
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:56,080
not entirely sold of whether they should

535
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:58,720
be collapsed or not by default but for

536
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:59,199
mobile it's actually much nicer to not

537
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,760
get a

538
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:03,039
wall of stuff before you get the news

539
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:05,120
maybe we could reorder it

540
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:06,559
uh to do that or something like that but

541
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,199
i think it's nice to have that kind of

542
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:10,559
intro bit

543
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:12,080
at first uh the read more stuff takes it

544
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:14,000
to the documentation site to the

545
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:17,439
introduction article there

546
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:21,600
which is the old well yeah it

547
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:24,559
uh the old website takes you to

548
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:25,678
directly to the to the news that's the

549
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:29,760
only thing you see

550
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:30,880
to begin with um so i think so was the

551
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:33,280
introduction

552
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:35,600
i think it was like the next slide so

553
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,600
i'm gonna

554
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:38,960
oh this is

555
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:50,080
this is not great but okay

556
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:52,320
yeah all right so this isn't uh my

557
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:53,840
my desktop in system system being high

558
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:57,520
dpi here

559
00:21:53,840 --> 00:22:00,080
uh yeah so

560
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,879
kind of like this is more of what i kind

561
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:04,000
of envision

562
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:04,480
uh it's looking like on on a desktop at

563
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,039
least

564
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:08,000
so you kind of like get here and uh and

565
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:11,840
you

566
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:14,960
immediately see kind of what it's uh

567
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,959
provides some apis

568
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:28,159
yes i know this

569
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:29,360
like this is a mock-up if we remove

570
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:32,240
stuff we remove stuff

571
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:33,840
like this isn't uh i don't mean for for

572
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:35,120
like i don't mean for any of the content

573
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:40,320
here to be final i'm

574
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:41,840
totally open for you know

575
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:43,439
some drivers are going to be a country

576
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,918
of compliance and some are not going to

577
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:47,120
be

578
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:50,720
yeah so i wonder here

579
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:52,879
i mean if we do well even without the

580
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:55,039
logo just doing your name

581
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,039
then

582
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:04,399
so i i don't think so i don't think

583
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:06,000
these things

584
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,320
says that we're conforming for all

585
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:11,039
drivers i don't think we violate the

586
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:13,840
kronos kind of uh

587
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:17,200
trademark rules here but i think we

588
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:17,199
should ask chronos what they think

589
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:20,559
chronos is pretty friendly to the mesa

590
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:23,520
project

591
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:25,280
so i'm not like i'm not too uh worried

592
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:27,120
if there's a logo we need to remove

593
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:28,720
we like some of these things don't

594
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:30,719
really have logos i

595
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:32,640
for opencl i really didn't want to use

596
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:34,799
their horrible logo anyway

597
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:36,559
uh because it's like looks so different

598
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:40,080
and it kind of uh

599
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:40,080
yeah it's i guess

600
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:46,640
yeah i mean that could we just like

601
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,120
right under the feature api is there

602
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:49,760
like

603
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:50,559
note some of these are not implemented

604
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:53,120
for all

605
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:54,480
hardware and stuff like that i yeah

606
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,199
maybe something that would be a good

607
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,840
idea to

608
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:59,600
kind of lower expectations a bit yeah so

609
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:03,279
there's like a list of drivers

610
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:06,480
here also i'm i'm this is not

611
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:07,679
all of the drivers it's uh i'm not sure

612
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,279
if we

613
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:11,200
i don't know i don't love this this is

614
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:12,640
like um

615
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,960
one thing that i don't love about this

616
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:16,240
is it kind of forces us to order all the

617
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,159
drivers

618
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:21,039
uh so i i kind of like instead of having

619
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:23,919
to choose an order i just like

620
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:25,600
these are sorted alphabetically the

621
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:27,840
order we get it out of the file system

622
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:31,199
for like uh when we iterate over the

623
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:34,480
data sets in uh in jekyll

624
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:37,520
i don't know uh also i think

625
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:39,760
these strings are probably wrong

626
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:40,720
for a bunch of them and like i think all

627
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:43,440
of the

628
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:45,039
driver maintainers should go through

629
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,520
each of the strings here and verify that

630
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:48,960
they're

631
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:52,799
reasonably correct could we incorporate

632
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:54,400
a matrix here like that for me

633
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:56,480
yeah yeah i think so i think that would

634
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:59,679
be this would be a good place to put

635
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:02,080
a mesomatrix as long as we can find a

636
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:06,159
way of reasonably integrating it into

637
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:06,158
the build pipeline but i i'm sure we can

638
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:15,919
so i have a question um

639
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:18,159
to show you how to use it and everything

640
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:22,240
that's visa is just an implementation

641
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:24,640
of a bunch of standards we don't really

642
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:26,400
um we're not there to show you how to

643
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:29,039
use gll

644
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,039
we kept just

645
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:34,770
[Music]

646
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:42,240
yeah what is the kind of thing that you

647
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:43,840
would want to see on the website

648
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:46,240
well you look like getting started i

649
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:46,799
think but like you didn't start it on

650
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:49,600
what's

651
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:51,120
because to me uh visa is kind of just a

652
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,760
leap that you compile and install on

653
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,520
your system

654
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:56,080
and that's it then you use your app

655
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:57,600
normally or you write an app but then

656
00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:00,080
that's

657
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:01,678
what api you want to use for your app so

658
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:03,279
i don't really understand

659
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:04,960
what it is that you want to see so

660
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:07,679
that's my question

661
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:10,480
this might be a bit tangential itself

662
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:13,919
but using cases for example that are

663
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:14,720
uncommon like using egl in context of

664
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:17,440
kms

665
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,840
and drm which doesn't really exist you

666
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:20,480
could

667
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:21,600
hunt down that information whereas using

668
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:24,000
egl glx

669
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,799
in the context of x is easy to find

670
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,480
piles

671
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:30,320
that's just not there um for example

672
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,600
that would be one thing i think these

673
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:33,279
introductions to that

674
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:34,879
um for people who want to get started

675
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:36,840
hacking on mesa itself

676
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:38,240
introductions to its structure how it

677
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,840
works um

678
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:41,679
you know bits of code you could possibly

679
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:43,918
hack on and modify to see

680
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:44,799
how it affects mises implementation so

681
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:47,760
people can

682
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:48,320
poke it and see how it wobbles kind of

683
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:50,480
safely

684
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:52,240
so what if i mess with i don't know um

685
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:53,600
the shady compiler and then you make it

686
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:55,600
do something

687
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:57,199
that kind of thing um because really

688
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:59,439
that's the implementation

689
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:01,760
mostly that's what you want people to

690
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:03,679
start learning and figuring out

691
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:06,080
i think you need separate introductions

692
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:08,000
for users and developers so i'd like to

693
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:09,120
have it split yeah have it split like

694
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,960
hey if you're a user

695
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:13,039
go here these are the drivers you're

696
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,919
looking for and you can install it for

697
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:15,679
your distro

698
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:18,960
hey if you're a developer go here here

699
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:23,279
the docs start here

700
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:25,360
yeah so yeah so from a kind of uh

701
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:27,120
perspective of what i've uh shown here i

702
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:30,559
think like um

703
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:32,840
a lot of these things are kind of about

704
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:34,320
which articles to have in the in the

705
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:36,320
documentation which

706
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:38,559
i think is great to have more articles

707
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:40,879
about uh more stuff

708
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:41,760
uh and we need to put that somewhere i

709
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:43,840
don't know

710
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,960
i don't know if the website or the docs

711
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:48,480
are best for

712
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:48,799
every kind of article guessing probably

713
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:52,240
the

714
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:54,879
the docs uh it's going to be where you

715
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:56,880
want most of this technical stuff

716
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:58,080
so so i think for that stuff maybe we

717
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:00,240
just want some kind of

718
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:02,158
a visible link for the most important

719
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:04,240
stuff on the website

720
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:06,240
to to where we can put stuff like that

721
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:08,159
i'm not really myself looking into

722
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:09,279
like writing a whole lot of content

723
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:12,559
because

724
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:15,600
it's not something i'm good at i'm sorry

725
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:17,678
but yeah i think there's a lot of uh

726
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:19,199
stuff we could have better content and i

727
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:20,880
think there's probably

728
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,480
not enough people out there who's

729
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:25,120
willing to contribute uh

730
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:26,799
some of their knowledge if if they know

731
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:30,080
how and where

732
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:32,879
so uh so it could be that uh

733
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:35,520
making the barrier lower here might get

734
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,520
get us some more

735
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:48,480
documentation

736
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:49,840
so i could mention something else i uh

737
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:52,000
there's one thing that i'm not very

738
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:55,279
happy happy about with the current

739
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:57,200
implementation there i used jekyll to

740
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:59,840
build the whole thing and

741
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:01,919
i pretty quickly stumble into problems

742
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:02,799
of performance with uh with jekyll so

743
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:04,640
i've been

744
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:05,840
considering rewriting it using something

745
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:08,799
like hugo or

746
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,799
a faster one

747
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:14,879
yeah the site generator

748
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:16,000
uh i think about 30 seconds on my laptop

749
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:18,799
which it's not

750
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:21,679
horrible if but it's not great to kind

751
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:24,960
of like change one little detail and uh

752
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:28,559
uh wait 30 seconds until and

753
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:31,200
it's also like you can run

754
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:32,639
live mode with jekyll and that's fast

755
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:34,480
because then it's just incremental

756
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:36,399
yeah but incremental builds like if you

757
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:37,919
change the template then it builds all

758
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:39,600
of the pages

759
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:41,600
and it kind of like just serves the old

760
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:44,719
content until the build is done

761
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:48,879
which i think is not fantastic

762
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:50,559
um so it's uh i think it's much better

763
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:53,600
to work on than the current

764
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:55,760
uh solution but it's still not perfect

765
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:57,120
but i also think that maybe the websites

766
00:29:55,760 --> 00:30:00,640
don't need as much

767
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:03,279
work on it as the documentation site

768
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:04,240
uh in terms of content so maybe it's

769
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:07,200
okay

770
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:08,000
i think it's for now i'm happier with

771
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:11,279
this than the current

772
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,640
solution uh so

773
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:16,159
i would be happy to move on with this

774
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:16,159
and then look into performance later for

775
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:23,840
instance

776
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:27,739
[Music]

777
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,120
yeah i think that would be my next thing

778
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:32,799
to try

779
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:34,959
uh i've used hugo a little bit i get

780
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:36,799
very confused by hugo

781
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:39,440
feels like i'm too dumb for hugo or

782
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:43,279
something but uh

783
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:45,840
but maybe i should give it another try

784
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:47,200
i've seen people rebuild jekyll sites in

785
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:51,439
hugo with uh

786
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:56,080
kind of getting the exact same sights so

787
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:57,519
hmm yeah

788
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:59,840
yeah i think the only thing is that hugo

789
00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:03,200
is a little bit more insistent on having

790
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:04,879
all of your content being like a tree

791
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:06,880
yeah it's like everything is like

792
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:09,440
directories or nodes

793
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:10,640
kind of where whereas in jekyll it's

794
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:12,559
just pa it's all just

795
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:14,080
pages and you kind of insert the links

796
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:16,000
yourself like the relationship between

797
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:17,519
the articles are

798
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:21,440
up to the content and then hugo it's

799
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:21,440
kind of like part of the structure

800
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:33,600
yeah maybe i i've

801
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:35,840
i so as i said i felt very stupid trying

802
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:39,120
to use hugo i feel like i'm a little bit

803
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:40,320
too dumb for it uh so maybe there's

804
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:42,879
something that i just

805
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:43,360
don't get yeah so i got the message that

806
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:46,399
we're

807
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:46,799
15 minutes left here uh so yeah and

808
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:48,080
they're

809
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:50,879
probably the next speaker wants to

810
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:53,199
connect soon so uh yeah

811
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,919
if but if anyone has any more questions

812
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:59,850
or

813
00:31:53,919 --> 00:32:01,519
ideas yeah

814
00:31:59,850 --> 00:32:05,360
[Music]

815
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:07,919
right seems like the

816
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:15,840
discussion is over yeah all right cool

817
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:15,840
thanks a lot

818
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:21,760
you
