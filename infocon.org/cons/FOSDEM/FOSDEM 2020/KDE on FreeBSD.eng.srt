1
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:07,759
um

2
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:09,200
i really appreciate that everyone's here

3
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:11,120
hi i'm adrian i'm going to talk about

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:14,160
kde on freebsd

5
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:16,560
and i would like to remind you

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,320
beforehand that kde is a community

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,240
people talk about it like it's software

8
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,720
but kde is a community

9
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:23,519
and we make a bunch of software some of

10
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:26,160
it is called

11
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:28,080
kde frameworks that's 80 some odd

12
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,160
libraries that build on top of qt

13
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,598
that give you useful desktop integration

14
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,840
useful extensions to cute

15
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:35,360
it also builds kde plasma which is the

16
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,880
desktop part that everybody always

17
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,879
thinks about

18
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,079
it also builds kde applications the

19
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:43,680
applications range

20
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:45,600
from the simplistic color color paint

21
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:48,079
type applications to advanced video

22
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,000
editors but as a community we build a

23
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:55,440
whole lot of software

24
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:59,039
and people call it kde there is no kde 5

25
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:02,160
except imports um

26
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:04,720
because it had to have a name and the

27
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,960
previous one was called kde4

28
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:08,880
and port's numbering is complicated so

29
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,280
that's why it's called this way

30
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:13,039
but the software we install is called kd

31
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,080
frameworks kd plasma and kde

32
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,080
applications

33
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,600
and then you run and run gnome

34
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,640
applications on top of that because some

35
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,759
of them are really good

36
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,320
like glimpse so kde runs everywhere

37
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:24,240
right

38
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,320
it runs on laptops and desktops and

39
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:29,119
phones and tablets and things

40
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:30,158
and even other operating systems and

41
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:33,200
none of us care about

42
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:35,680
this list right because

43
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:38,079
we really want to have freebsd on the

44
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:40,400
desktop

45
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:42,240
at least until netcraft confirms that

46
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:45,119
freebsd is on the desktop

47
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:47,759
so i'm going to talk a little bit about

48
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:52,560
how we do kde on the desktop but

49
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:54,320
um sorry

50
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,920
oh yeah no that's that's right it's

51
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:59,119
supposed to go off screen

52
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:01,360
um so the three main

53
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:02,799
kde on freebsd people doing the

54
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:07,039
maintenance of the ports

55
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:11,280
uh is tobias myself and kaiknobi

56
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:13,200
um tobias is

57
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,280
more on the freebsd side i am slightly

58
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:18,720
more on the kde side and kai

59
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,760
is stuck doing web engine and web engine

60
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,359
is chromium

61
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:24,319
and everyone knows that chromium on

62
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:27,680
freebsd is a horrible horrible thing

63
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:29,839
um maybe not everyone knows that but

64
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:32,080
it's 600 patches

65
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,200
where you're fighting upstream and

66
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,760
that's no fun at all

67
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,720
so we really appreciate that kai deals

68
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,959
with that

69
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,000
there's a shark over there you may want

70
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:42,400
to visit the shark

71
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,400
go ahead

72
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,400
aside from the main porting team we've

73
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,840
also got

74
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:56,800
gleb popov loisa raphael

75
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,760
they all incidentally do porting work or

76
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:02,800
do

77
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:05,760
supporting work gleb aerod

78
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:07,360
is responsible for bs disks which is

79
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,319
very useful i'll talk about that briefly

80
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,400
later

81
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:12,000
um we also work together with the

82
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:15,120
desktop at

83
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,840
uh group that's recently been founded uh

84
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,920
to bring together all the freebsd on the

85
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:22,800
desktop developers as one

86
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,280
maintainer group and about half of it is

87
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,040
known

88
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,480
that's why gnome is at the bottom here

89
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:30,879
half cut off see i thought about it

90
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,399
because we work closely together with

91
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:35,280
the gnome gnome

92
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,959
ports maintainers um because we have

93
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:40,000
very similar needs

94
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:41,760
right we're trying to produce a nice

95
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,280
freebsd on the desktop

96
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,720
and sure one of them is more shiny than

97
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,840
the other and the other has a green

98
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,840
tablecloth but

99
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:52,720
so it doesn't really matter it's better

100
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:56,239
to work together

101
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:59,359
the kde freebsd team maintains

102
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:02,720
the kde freebsd stack which has

103
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:06,159
cmake in there cmake is a c plus

104
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:09,359
meta build tool it's used by about

105
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:13,359
a little over two thousand ports a lot

106
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:14,959
of c plus plus code uses cmake nowadays

107
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,479
we maintain that as part of the

108
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,238
infrastructure

109
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:19,519
that means that every time that updates

110
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:23,039
which is

111
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:25,040
every six weeks uh we get to x run it

112
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:27,360
and deal with a whole lot of old

113
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:29,280
horrible c plus plus code that no longer

114
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:32,400
works with the latest cmake

115
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:34,799
um anyone want to make snide c plus

116
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,799
comment

117
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,120
i mean

118
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:45,360
yeah yeah we maintain eigen which

119
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,720
is an an algebra library ninja

120
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,120
everyone's favorite build tool right

121
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,120
because it's

122
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:54,840
ninja in combination with cmake is fine

123
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:59,520
um i wouldn't write that by hand

124
00:04:54,840 --> 00:05:00,719
um the reason we maintain ninja is that

125
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:04,000
we did experiments

126
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:08,400
ninja builds kde software about 10

127
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:11,680
faster than gnu make or bsd make

128
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:13,840
and we like those ten percent because

129
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,039
they're long compiles we maintain cute

130
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:18,080
which is the toolkit

131
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:20,159
upon which kde uh is founded uh we

132
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:24,800
maintain poplar together with desktop

133
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:27,120
together with gnome because um poplar

134
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,919
is a pdf viewing library and that's used

135
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,759
both by

136
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:34,240
events and ocular the kde

137
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:35,199
application so that's that's where our

138
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,840
shared

139
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:39,520
uh our shared stack comes in and of

140
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:41,440
course we do the actual kde frameworks

141
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:44,000
plasma and applications

142
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,639
frameworks releases once a month uh

143
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,240
plasma

144
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:52,720
every three months and applications

145
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:55,840
twice a year hi

146
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,840
the sharks are over there

147
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,280
um so we have very regular release

148
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,759
cycles

149
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:07,359
that means an awful lot of rebuilding

150
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:08,800
and exp running and

151
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,479
i would like to take a moment to say

152
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,680
thank you to antoine for pushing the

153
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:14,560
button all the time

154
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,440
for us on those x runs so kde is a

155
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,800
desktop

156
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:20,479
um the curious thing is once you get

157
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:23,520
your desktop up and running

158
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:25,039
you can't see the difference um actually

159
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:27,280
if you look real closely

160
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:28,318
here's an open souza logo so that's what

161
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:31,520
it looks like on

162
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:32,479
uh opensuse and if i were to switch into

163
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,240
freebsd

164
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:35,840
and start my desktop it would look like

165
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,840
this except the little k

166
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,840
look k logo there i mean there really is

167
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,560
no difference and so that's the curious

168
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,039
thing

169
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:45,919
in the end if you're just a plain

170
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:48,560
desktop user

171
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:49,198
the underlying os doesn't really matter

172
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,960
except that

173
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:52,880
in the case of freebsd you get cfs

174
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,560
snapshots and jails and all the other

175
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,319
coolness that you can also run on your

176
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,680
system

177
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:00,319
but from a desktop perspective it

178
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:03,840
doesn't really matter

179
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:05,759
um once you've got desktop kde

180
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,599
up and running as a desktop um

181
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:10,639
everything works

182
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:13,120
almost um this is the whole list or this

183
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:15,520
is a list that i took from tobias

184
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:17,280
user management is one of those things

185
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:19,599
there's

186
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:22,080
a kde system settings module where you

187
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:23,440
can do user management add users remove

188
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:27,198
users from the system

189
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:29,039
and of course we call that user add

190
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:31,680
and on the linux world that's called add

191
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:34,639
user and or is it the other way around

192
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,639
i can never remember

193
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:40,880
everything is horrible

194
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:45,280
so user management doesn't quite work

195
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,120
but

196
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,559
how many of us actually do user

197
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,520
management from a graphical user

198
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:53,360
interface

199
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:55,758
right you ooh ooh okay so so you're our

200
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,199
test user next time

201
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:59,680
and if you don't use kde you can be

202
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:01,039
gnome's test user that would great

203
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,800
uh power management is one of those

204
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:04,080
things we've got a long-standing pr

205
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,280
about login.conf

206
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:08,318
the the special um

207
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:10,318
[Music]

208
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:12,080
resource limit configurations that

209
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:14,879
freebsd has um

210
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:16,639
removable devices is a thing that's

211
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:18,319
where bs disks comes back in and

212
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:20,560
ejecting cds and i'm going to focus on

213
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:22,960
ejecting cds because i happen to have a

214
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:27,520
cd drive in my workstation

215
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:30,159
i'm old school um

216
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:31,599
this is an incredible corner case as far

217
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,479
as i'm concerned but it's also one of

218
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:34,718
those things where

219
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:36,640
if you happen to have one it's important

220
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:40,080
right and every person's bug

221
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:42,319
is really important to them and

222
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,200
stupid to the developers who don't have

223
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,560
the same

224
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,839
uh the same needs um how does cd

225
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,319
ejecting work well

226
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:51,519
solid is one of the kde frameworks and

227
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,160
it deals with hardware

228
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:54,880
it's an abstraction layer kde loves

229
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,800
extraction

230
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,800
abstraction layers we have abstraction

231
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:01,199
layers on abstraction layers

232
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,880
built on c plus plus we know you get the

233
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,680
picture

234
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,480
it's and one of the back ends it can use

235
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,839
is how

236
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,399
hal is of course the hardware

237
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:14,000
abstraction layer so that's where we get

238
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:17,600
the abstractions upon abstractions thing

239
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:20,080
um the how backend on the linux side

240
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,680
in the code base kde code base has been

241
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,279
removed entirely

242
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,719
because nobody uses that anymore they

243
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:28,240
have better things

244
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:31,440
namely udev

245
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:33,040
thank you um it's been almost entirely

246
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,600
removed for the freebsd side

247
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:38,560
except for one little bit and that's

248
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,560
ejecting the cd

249
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,040
so and that's why we have a package

250
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,680
message saying

251
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,680
turn on hal

252
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:49,760
you can of course just use the eject

253
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:54,560
commands i mean that's what i do

254
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:54,560
i switch the terminal type in eject

255
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,240
i suppose i suppose we could i mean you

256
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:04,000
can do a lot of stupid things in

257
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:06,959
desktop files so it would work out

258
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,399
but the actual code is trying to talk to

259
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:09,119
solid which is trying to talk to its own

260
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:11,120
back end

261
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,320
and we'd have to special we'd basically

262
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:15,920
rip out hal

263
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:18,959
and replace it with a c library

264
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:22,479
system a user local bin

265
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:25,680
eject some

266
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:28,240
yes it works it also feels a bit clutchy

267
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:30,000
um so that's why ejecting a cd from the

268
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:33,040
desktop still needs hell

269
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,160
and we're going to fix that um

270
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,719
and we're going to fix that together

271
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:40,000
with dome because gnome also has some

272
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:43,279
remaining hal dependencies so

273
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,120
bsdisks is stuff that gleb

274
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:47,839
has created it's basically a shim that

275
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:51,279
provides the kind of interface

276
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:54,480
that um

277
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:55,279
it it provides a udev type interface uh

278
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,680
that

279
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:59,040
applications can talk to so we can use

280
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:02,479
the linux code

281
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:05,120
unmodified and deal with the api

282
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,959
it expects this is a successful approach

283
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:10,720
because it means that we write code

284
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:11,199
once to provide an api translate the api

285
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,480
to some

286
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:16,640
to what we do natively and then

287
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,079
once we've got that all the desktop

288
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:21,519
environments that expect

289
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:23,199
the linux api uh can use it so that

290
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:25,839
means that we have shared effort

291
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:27,519
in getting stuff done so we need to fix

292
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:30,240
up bs disks

293
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:31,600
to support ejecting the cd again it's a

294
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:34,160
terrible

295
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,680
niche case but it's got to be done once

296
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:38,719
we've done that we can drop

297
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:42,000
hal from the freebsd side

298
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:43,519
of kde and from there we can drop about

299
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,079
1100 lines of code

300
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:47,600
in kde upstream and that will make a

301
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:48,880
bunch of people very happy that we no

302
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:52,399
longer have to deal with

303
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:56,079
hal at all anywhere so happiness

304
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:58,639
is in the future um

305
00:11:56,079 --> 00:12:00,560
but as always the last five percent of

306
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:04,399
the talk takes five minutes

307
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:07,439
um no the last the last little bits

308
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:08,480
are always uh take the longest so we've

309
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,560
got a fine work

310
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,160
fine functioning kde desktop plus all

311
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,839
the kd applications

312
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:16,480
but getting this polishing done takes a

313
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:18,720
long time takes a lot of coordination

314
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,639
and just finding it i mean the only

315
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,399
reason i'm i'm complaining about cd

316
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:24,959
ejecting is because i have one

317
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:25,700
and i use that to rip rick astley cds i

318
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:29,040
kid you not

319
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:33,440
[Laughter]

320
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:33,439
yeah yeah he's easy

321
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:39,839
i like the way you think um

322
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:42,000
so we're connected to many different

323
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:43,440
parts here we're connected to gnome

324
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,480
where we work together on lots of the

325
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:47,680
infrastructure

326
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:49,920
we now have desktop apps to unify

327
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:51,439
some of these efforts weyland is coming

328
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,680
in about 40 minutes

329
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:56,480
uh so rachel will be telling you about

330
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:59,439
weyland and what's happening there

331
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:01,120
uh we're the kde is also eager to

332
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:03,440
cooperate on that so that we can

333
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,800
lift the whole thing into the modern

334
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:09,200
world

335
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:12,479
and that's sort of the end of my my bits

336
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:13,440
to sum up uh kde runs on freebsd just

337
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,279
fine

338
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,639
there's bits and bobs that need need

339
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:18,000
work and we're still cooperating with

340
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:20,480
everyone to get that

341
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,160
fixed weyland is coming and we're happy

342
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:27,200
about that

343
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:29,839
any more questions i just want to

344
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,800
show my appreciation for you i prefer

345
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:32,839
using glimpse

346
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,639
instead of a new image installation

347
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:38,079
program

348
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:40,160
because my friends are maintainers i see

349
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:41,439
so more of a question than a no more a

350
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,120
comment than a question

351
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:46,560
you should be eaten by monsters for

352
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,560
commenting instead of questioning

353
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:52,240
thank you for using glimpse my pleasure

354
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,240
other questions

355
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:56,240
one here compositing video acceleration

356
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:58,320
how is that

357
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,440
compositing video acceleration how is

358
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:02,320
that well

359
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:04,880
everything goes through opengl and if

360
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:08,320
you're as long as you're using

361
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:12,000
a drm k mod for intel is just fine

362
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:17,839
um i run two quad hd

363
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,839
displays off of that and it's fine

364
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:21,279
um i've never tried watching netflix on

365
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:24,079
my

366
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:24,079
bsd desktop

367
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:31,199
vrm might be an issue or the nvidia

368
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:33,199
proprietary drivers are fine as well um

369
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:37,120
the one time i tried radeon

370
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:39,760
uh things got ugly but

371
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:41,120
i don't know enough about that we should

372
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,839
talk to graphics people like

373
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,800
nicholas one more question then we're

374
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:50,079
done

375
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:50,079
was starting to depend on a problem

376
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:55,040
the question is whether depending on

377
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:56,880
login d is a problem

378
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:58,560
we've got basically the same shim

379
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:01,040
approach as we do with

380
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:02,880
u-discs so we're looking to create the

381
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:06,319
same d bus interface

382
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:09,360
that talks to uh the actual

383
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:10,800
the real bits behind it and that once

384
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,920
we've got that solved

385
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:15,279
it's solved for everyone i'm not exactly

386
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,800
sure what the state is of that

387
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:19,120
that was the last question thank you for

388
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:27,839
attending thank you for paying attention

389
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:27,839
you got four minutes the next one

390
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:31,279
you
