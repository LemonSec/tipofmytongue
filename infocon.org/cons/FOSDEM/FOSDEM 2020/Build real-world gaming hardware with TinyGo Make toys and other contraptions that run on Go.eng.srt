1
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,680
cool so it's 10 30 so we can start

2
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:19,198
okay so next up we have danielle is

3
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,080
going to be talking about tiny go and

4
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,400
how to build

5
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:30,240
toys with tiny go and lots of hardware

6
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:33,200
so run a vocals for him please

7
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,800
i'm daniel esteban also known as conejo

8
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,920
and

9
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:42,319
i will talk today about building

10
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:45,360
toys or games devices with tiny go

11
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,239
and a maker is like i make things on my

12
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,079
free time

13
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:52,480
usually involving electronics and

14
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:55,199
maybe you are asking what what is tiny

15
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,160
goal tanego is not a subset or a super

16
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:59,519
set of

17
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:02,640
god is the same language it's just

18
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:06,559
a new compiler that targets

19
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,559
a very very small place

20
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:13,439
we released version 0.12

21
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,720
two days ago if you want to know more

22
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:18,158
about chinese

23
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:21,360
you could check the link there

24
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:25,040
about the last year at fosden also talk

25
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:28,479
from ron evan and no we are a sponsor

26
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,479
uh by google

27
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,880
when i talk about small places i talk

28
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:35,600
about this kind of

29
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:37,759
microcontroller like they are really

30
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:40,720
small

31
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:41,200
maybe you should see these one of you

32
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:45,600
but

33
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:48,720
it's like arduino uh bbc microbead

34
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:54,720
some of the adafruit like itsy bitsy or

35
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:58,640
secret plate playground spray

36
00:01:54,720 --> 00:02:01,920
technical also compiles your go program

37
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:05,439
to smart watches like the pine time

38
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:08,640
just go to the aw building

39
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:11,119
and check the pine 64 booth stand they

40
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:11,119
have there

41
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:20,560
we have super for several other

42
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:23,599
devices sensor and actuators like a

43
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:27,280
rgb leds real-time clock

44
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:30,079
humidity temperature sensor uh sound

45
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:32,560
light sensor distance all those things

46
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,560
and also

47
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:39,920
a lot of displays

48
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:43,360
if you don't have any bar or jet or

49
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:46,559
you don't have any devices to play

50
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:49,840
you could we also have a playground

51
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:52,400
with we simulate some

52
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,920
of the bar and you could try tiny go

53
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,640
without installing anything

54
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,640
on your computer

55
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:04,159
so what are you going to see today

56
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:06,239
well some small toys some

57
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:07,359
fun to make project that you could do at

58
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:09,840
home

59
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,959
all the information is on the slide i

60
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,000
will upload

61
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:16,640
later i will just go

62
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,200
over the highlight or the main different

63
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,480
part

64
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:23,518
that you need the very basic you need to

65
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:27,518
make this project so

66
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:31,120
the first one is the gopher set

67
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:31,760
i don't know if you know that this game

68
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,799
is called

69
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:37,920
simon sometimes like it plays

70
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:39,599
uh a different tone and lights a

71
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:42,879
different color and you need to

72
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:46,879
match that color and it will

73
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:49,120
be going a longer sequence each time

74
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:49,120
you

75
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:53,280
you are

76
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:05,519
for the simon

77
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:06,159
it's very simple we'll only use three

78
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:09,599
buttons

79
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:12,560
and three el e led

80
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:12,798
and some printed bar and i will just use

81
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,238
an

82
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:18,720
adafruit background express

83
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:18,719
which is

84
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:22,078
this little bar

85
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:34,960
or go code we start with the import

86
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:38,160
we just need to import the main package

87
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,560
the machine package which is a special

88
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:43,600
one

89
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:47,120
to talk to the hardware and we also

90
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:51,440
are going to import like johnnygo.org x

91
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,440
driver buzzer which is to make sound

92
00:04:54,639 --> 00:05:02,880
to set up the the led we just define

93
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:06,240
an led like emerging dot a1 or

94
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:09,280
a2 or maybe d12 because it's the pin

95
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,280
number on your board

96
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:16,160
we configure it as an

97
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:21,120
output pin here and

98
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:24,479
to enable the led is as simple as

99
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:28,160
led dot high or led dot

100
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:28,159
low to disable it

101
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:40,479
for the three buttons it's very similar

102
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,440
also

103
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:44,000
but instead of output we configure them

104
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,280
as an

105
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,800
input and just to check the status of

106
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:52,239
the button it is pressed

107
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:53,039
or not yes we do button.get and it will

108
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,800
return

109
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:56,800
a true false

110
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:04,560
for the batter which is a small speaker

111
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:09,280
that makes sound

112
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:09,280
again we define the buzzer pin

113
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:18,080
we configure it as an output

114
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:18,080
and then we create a buzzer

115
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:25,440
device and to play us on is as simple

116
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,160
as just call the function tone with a

117
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:29,680
note

118
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,680
and a duration of that note

119
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:36,639
the rest of the code is your normal go

120
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:36,639
code

121
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:45,440
there is no difference there there

122
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:49,198
and scene is a bit longer than i i

123
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,758
wanted to i

124
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:52,319
will not show but it's already in the

125
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:54,720
slide

126
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:56,319
and indeed have to check it but you will

127
00:06:54,720 --> 00:07:00,479
check is the same

128
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:00,479
it's the same as go and this no

129
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:05,039
difference

130
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,000
to flash it on your board so it's

131
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:08,960
program

132
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,160
you usually just connect it to your

133
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:13,599
computer and

134
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:17,759
normally is you press double press

135
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:21,599
the rest button so

136
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:25,599
it's your the bar in this case the

137
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:30,159
secret playground express enter

138
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:33,280
the programmable state

139
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,280
and then it's

140
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:46,800
oh i'm sure

141
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:46,800
and i don't know how to change now

142
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:53,520
i could make bigger

143
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:55,840
yeah so

144
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:57,039
to flash it it's just as simple as tiny

145
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:59,039
gold flash

146
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:01,440
just specified your target in this case

147
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:05,039
the circuit player and play express

148
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:07,599
and the code you are going

149
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:07,599
to flash

150
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:13,680
we wait a little

151
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:27,840
and now wait

152
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:27,840
it has a battery so

153
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:33,120
and now we have our goal program here

154
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:41,838
eating to play

155
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:55,839
and if we go longer and longer it's a

156
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:06,080
for the next one uh

157
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:08,800
i don't know probably you know the game

158
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:12,399
called pong it's

159
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,399
sometimes a hokey game

160
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:16,800
we just need a display this one is not

161
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:19,680
so tiny

162
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,160
it's a little big actually this is one

163
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,959
like

164
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,600
you could put one several together and

165
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:26,399
make

166
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:29,120
those big billboards on the street or in

167
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,120
the stadium

168
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:33,600
yeah it's supported by chinese and also

169
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:37,279
for this case

170
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:41,680
uh i just add a real-time clock

171
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:44,720
so actually the game is playing itself

172
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:45,359
while showing the hour and when it's

173
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,720
time

174
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:51,080
one player or the other will lose

175
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,480
for the game we just need two

176
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:55,279
potentiometers

177
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,279
i use then

178
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,680
as the knob here

179
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:08,399
they are analog input we also use

180
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:10,800
that huge led matrix

181
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:11,920
and in this case i choose an arduino

182
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:16,839
nano

183
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:20,560
33 iot and as you said a real-time clock

184
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:22,560
optional again the the import part is

185
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:24,719
you just need to import the machine

186
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:27,839
package

187
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:31,120
the driver for the hub 75 which is the

188
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:32,720
led matrix driver for the real-time

189
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:35,760
clock and the

190
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:38,160
tiny phone package which is a

191
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,200
special package also that allow us to

192
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:44,319
draw text

193
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:44,320
on every tiny gold display supported

194
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:48,800
for the analog input it's very similar

195
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,120
as the

196
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,640
button of the previous example in this

197
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:55,600
case we need to

198
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:56,560
initialize the analog to digital

199
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:00,640
converter

200
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:03,119
but the same is we just choose a pin

201
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,680
and configure it and instead of true

202
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:08,240
false

203
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:12,399
now we are getting an integer variable

204
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:16,240
depending on the value of the analog

205
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:18,720
for the screen also quite simple we just

206
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,519
really find a serial peripheral

207
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:23,600
interface

208
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:27,920
cpi interface uh for the screen

209
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:29,040
and we create a hub 75 which is the

210
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:32,319
screen

211
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:35,199
device we make some configuration

212
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,760
of the displays but then we just call

213
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,680
like

214
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,880
we could change each pixel with set

215
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:43,839
pixel yes the

216
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:43,839
x y coordinate and the color

217
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:58,079
again you write the rest of the code you

218
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:03,040
put it in bootload mode and flash it

219
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:03,040
and there you have it here

220
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,360
for the real-time clock again in this

221
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:17,518
instead of

222
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:20,560
spi interfaces and i2c we configure it

223
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:22,560
and we just use like uh

224
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:24,160
you will see i mean you are seeing that

225
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:26,719
this is normal

226
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,719
go code

227
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:39,839
for a third project we could make a

228
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:39,839
portable game console

229
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:46,319
you have shown option this is all we are

230
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:53,839
also using this

231
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:53,839
as batch

232
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:09,600
but yeah

233
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:21,959
it's a little blurry sorry

234
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:28,560
okay

235
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:31,680
[Applause]

236
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:32,800
yeah i put the jiff there because it's

237
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:35,199
better

238
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:36,079
you have several options here you could

239
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:39,600
make a

240
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:42,959
homemade one with a spare part you have

241
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:45,199
uh or you could buy as there are some

242
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:48,638
board like this this is a pie batch but

243
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:51,839
there are also they a gamer or

244
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:54,959
each batch like more or less

245
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:58,720
as long as it has an display

246
00:13:54,959 --> 00:14:02,079
and some buttons you could make your

247
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:05,920
own games of course if you want

248
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:09,680
something more professional looking

249
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:09,680
you could use again boy advance

250
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:17,839
because actually

251
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:33,120
it's right we asked him

252
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:34,160
we just compiled a go code and it's

253
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:37,279
running on a

254
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:38,000
gameboy advance i cannot tell you

255
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:41,120
exactly

256
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:44,000
how you should put your

257
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:45,199
binary files there maybe it's not really

258
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,440
legal

259
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:47,439
but

260
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:58,639
and for your games you could use tiny

261
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,000
draw

262
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:05,680
it's a package to make

263
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:07,760
simple primitive on every

264
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:10,160
screen that is supported by the tango

265
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,160
right now

266
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:17,920
we also have tiny phone which is to

267
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:27,600
write text on the

268
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:30,639
displays also

269
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:31,199
the last two projects i like a lot they

270
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:34,000
are

271
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:36,959
community project they are also open

272
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:40,079
source and open hardware

273
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:43,359
the first one is called escornabot

274
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:46,399
which means beatles

275
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:49,759
and it's a educational robot

276
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:52,880
similar to a beebot or a

277
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:55,120
cubetto and it's great and i mean it's

278
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:58,720
been used in a school right now

279
00:15:55,120 --> 00:16:01,839
uh to introduce young children

280
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:04,720
into programming uh children are not

281
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:08,240
programming the robot itself but

282
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:11,279
uh there does just

283
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:15,199
using the top buttons here

284
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:19,040
to make the robot uh move or turn

285
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:22,240
it doesn't that much just uh

286
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:25,279
you the children click the button like

287
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:26,079
move forward one step or two a step then

288
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:29,040
turn right

289
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:29,040
then go backward

290
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:36,320
as i said it's been used and in a school

291
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:37,839
uh if it's not this corner but it's

292
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:41,440
usually the beebot or

293
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:45,440
kuvetto uh they they have several uh

294
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:48,480
different activities uh with them

295
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:50,320
for the robot uh you just the most

296
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:53,360
important is like you just need

297
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:55,440
two stepper motor five buttons uh

298
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,480
one bathroom to make sound which is

299
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,920
optional

300
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:03,199
uh some 3d printed bar and

301
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:06,319
a microcontroller

302
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:09,599
uh the different i mean

303
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:12,399
we already see how to use the button

304
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:12,879
and the only addition to this project is

305
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:16,400
the

306
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:19,839
use of two motors with the

307
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,839
easy stepper driver

308
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:25,600
in this case if you have one motor is

309
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:28,880
just create a new

310
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:31,439
step easy stable device

311
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:32,320
just configure and just tell the motor

312
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,440
to move

313
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:38,879
200 step but we have two so

314
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:42,160
instead we use easy step new dual

315
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:47,360
device and just

316
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:50,640
tell them move

317
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:52,959
again we flash the code and see in

318
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,960
action

319
00:17:54,400 --> 00:18:04,799
in this case uh it's a little gopher

320
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:04,799
so we just tell them to go forward

321
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:10,239
turn right and then come back because

322
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:15,840
and it's moving

323
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:47,678
um

324
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:50,480
the last project is possible my favorite

325
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:51,679
it's called open led race it's also a

326
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:55,360
community project

327
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:55,360
it's open source and open hardware

328
00:18:55,520 --> 00:19:01,440
you just create a racetrack without led

329
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:01,440
strip

330
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:10,719
and then make the different led

331
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:14,080
move i mean you simulate arrays

332
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:14,080
with any input

333
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:19,600
for this you need an addressable led

334
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,600
strip

335
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:27,520
anything as an input and

336
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:27,520
just a microcontroller

337
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:38,160
the only difference here is the ws2812

338
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:41,280
which is the led strip just select the

339
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:44,400
pin for that i put create a new device

340
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:47,840
and you just write the color you want to

341
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,840
appear on the led strip

342
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:56,080
i will need two volunteers that want to

343
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:58,799
compete in the game and

344
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:59,678
just wins on a hardware we have to give

345
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:02,879
away

346
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:06,000
so if you know how to click a button

347
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:08,320
please raise your

348
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,320
hand

349
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:13,840
yes okay

350
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:18,320
again since it's an open hardware

351
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,158
project

352
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:22,320
and a community driven i said you could

353
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:26,000
use anything as an input

354
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:29,120
so people is doing different

355
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:32,320
kind of things we just

356
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:32,959
simulate the track uh in this case on

357
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:35,840
the

358
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,640
left picture you you could we could

359
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:39,360
simulate the

360
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,919
gravity so we are creating a virtual

361
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:43,120
slope

362
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:46,559
that will slow your car

363
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:49,600
and uh on one side and speed it up

364
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:53,600
on the other

365
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:56,240
yeah also

366
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,639
in this case arduino nano has a wi-fi

367
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:00,480
chip

368
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:03,919
so why not add wi-fi to your project

369
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:09,360
and have telemetry data like the

370
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:09,360
professional and if the wi-fi works

371
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:46,240
okay maybe

372
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:49,039
are going to be the red gopher you are

373
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:49,039
going to be in there

374
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,840
wait

375
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:13,840
okay wait a minute

376
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:29,918
yes

377
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:33,520
okay it's too much yeah

378
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:34,159
no wait i don't know if they will feel

379
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:37,360
working

380
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:37,360
but we'll see

381
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:42,640
just oh it's not working but press the

382
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,639
button

383
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:56,959
yes

384
00:22:54,320 --> 00:23:03,039
oh what

385
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:03,039
[Applause]

386
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:09,360
and for for both of you this arduino

387
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:10,000
nano is compatible and you could make

388
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:13,479
this

389
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:20,240
so as i said everything is here

390
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:23,760
[Applause]

391

okay uh everything is here

392
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:29,919
all the uh projects you are working

393
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:33,679
and are on github right now and uh

394
