1
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:09,120
okay

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:09,519
thank you uh i will be speaking today uh

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:13,360
about

4
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:18,320
trivial world sorry uh french in a row

5
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:19,520
so it should be accustomed to the accent

6
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,480
i will be speaking about

7
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,480
three-dimensional

8
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:30,320
visualization application

9
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:32,399
for representing geographical time space

10
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,320
on behalf of alan rostis with many

11
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:37,360
researchers against

12
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,640
in this project which who can be here

13
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:41,600
today

14
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,320
so i will speak about what is the

15
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,840
problem with

16
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:49,039
time space

17
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,960
i will show some example of geographical

18
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:52,719
timespace representation

19
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:55,440
and i will give you some information

20
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,440
about the project

21
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:59,519
i can't show you make you a demo because

22
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:02,879
it's too

23
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:06,400
short in a time but let's

24
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:09,280
so what's the problem with time space

25
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,960
so in geography this is a geography

26
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:15,920
project

27
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:19,679
uh there is two major concept

28
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:22,240
issue say where is something where is it

29
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:25,360
and at what this sounds something is

30
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:30,158
from somewhere something else

31
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:33,520
uh but in the daily life movement

32
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:34,000
we uh thought about time where i go to

33
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,960
work

34
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,360
i don't say oh it's 15 kilometers i said

35
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,880
i

36
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:44,399
go to work in 15 minutes okay so we

37
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:46,720
fought in time so there is two concepts

38
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:48,000
in this geographical distance we have to

39
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:51,360
go to somewhere

40
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,240
and the geographical time space

41
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,040
so how can we represent those two

42
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,798
objects

43
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:00,079
the geographical time space and the

44
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,079
geographical distance

45
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,839
so i will show you some examples and

46
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,920
then

47
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,680
show you a little bit of shriving world

48
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,000
we'll try to

49
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,879
mitigate the issues so it's an old

50
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,239
question this is

51
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:18,720
uh the

52
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:22,640
pettinger table which is a

53
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:26,000
medieval document about a roman roman

54
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:26,480
iterarium and if you saw the the orange

55
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,520
line

56
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,000
with steps on it it's believed that one

57
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,040
step

58
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,000
is uh one day travel by horse

59
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:37,840
so it's a very old data and with that a

60
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,519
merchant and say okay

61
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:44,640
to go to where to where i have maybe

62
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:47,360
many many days of travel

63
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,640
so this is actually a solution it's not

64
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,800
very perfect

65
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:52,799
and we have some modern reflections on

66
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:56,239
it so this is um

67
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:58,400
famous mcl uh representation

68
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:01,440
uh it's an automotive so the world is

69
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,440
little shrinking

70
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,599
when the transportation modes can became

71
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,879
faster

72
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:12,159
for example at the before the industrial

73
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:15,359
revolution

74
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:16,159
you go there by horse carriage or by

75
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,040
foot so

76
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:20,879
the world was very big it's very it was

77
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:24,879
the next village was

78
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:24,879
already far

79
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:32,319
so and no nowadays the world is very

80
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,679
narrow you can go to new york in a

81
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:37,839
couple of hours

82
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,840
in a bunch of hours so

83
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:44,560
so it's a very great preparation to show

84
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:47,200
the acceleration of transportation modes

85
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,319
but you can't compare different modes

86
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:51,599
but not on the same

87
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:55,439
period so mods

88
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:58,798
can't exactly coexist

89
00:03:55,439 --> 00:04:02,239
mods i mean train cars

90
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:03,840
foods and so on transportation mods

91
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:05,360
and there's no representation of

92
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:09,360
networks

93
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:12,879
so the networks are different

94
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:16,959
on those this one from

95
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:19,839
chimizu in the 80s use

96
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:20,798
an animal for this and make the

97
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:24,080
cartography of it

98
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:27,280
it's from japan and try to

99
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:30,960
show how the japan striking is shrinking

100
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:34,559
uh with the variable of uh fast rain

101
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:36,560
in and airplanes

102
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,400
so it's a great to show acceleration we

103
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:44,000
we have uh

104
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:47,679
from the 60s to a project after the 80s

105
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:51,840
uh you can mix a little bit the

106
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:54,320
the mode but you it's not represent so

107
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:56,239
it's not easy to see if it's by train or

108
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:59,520
by plane

109
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:01,680
and you can maybe

110
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:03,680
thought about the networks but they are

111
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,960
not really

112
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:10,080
emphasis and phases

113
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:12,400
this map is about is

114
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,199
was made by tobler which is a famous who

115
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,560
is a famous

116
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:19,199
uh geographer and uh

117
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,800
it keeps the cities at their place made

118
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:25,840
networks in it

119
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:28,240
and uh try to make strings

120
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:30,719
in the network so the edges are three

121
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:34,320
are springs sorry

122
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:38,000
so good things networks are preserved

123
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:41,520
okay and represented

124
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:44,400
modes can partially co-exist also

125
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,120
but it doesn't show acceleration so you

126
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:49,359
are stuck

127
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:53,440
in uh it's a picture of one time

128
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:56,960
so the streaming world um

129
00:05:53,440 --> 00:06:00,080
hypothesis is to show in a 3d map

130
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:02,719
you keep all the

131
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:05,440
the summit of each cone is the actual

132
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:10,160
city it's in a 3d

133
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:13,199
projection and we we have two uh

134
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,400
two travel modes the fastest one is the

135
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:16,960
red line

136
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,239
always the red line it doesn't move and

137
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:21,919
you

138
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:23,600
we apply a ratio from the fastest to

139
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:25,599
the slowest and the slowest is

140
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:29,199
represented by the blue line

141
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:31,199
and actually the blue cone

142
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:32,240
which is it's a cone it's in 3d so it's

143
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:35,840
a cone

144
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:38,720
the blue cone summit is moving

145
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:40,479
uh a bit from the ratio between the

146
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:44,160
fastest and the slowest man

147
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:48,639
so for example with uh uh jet planes

148
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:51,680
and cars we have this kind of

149
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:52,319
cones but if you have a supersonic

150
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,680
planes

151
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:58,800
the cone is steeper okay because the

152
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:02,080
ratio the difference between a carb

153
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:06,880
going at 100 kilometers is very much

154
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:10,960
bigger so it gives things like that so

155
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:13,919
maybe in the early 30s you can go to

156
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:15,280
london to berlin this is the blue line

157
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:18,479
this is actual

158
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:21,919
position of the city this is a worldwide

159
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:25,840
map so each submit is an airport

160
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:26,159
actually so in eight hours maybe you can

161
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,758
do

162
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:33,440
that distance with a proper airplane

163
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:37,360
it's pretty much like 2060 kilometers

164
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:39,599
london to bucharest if you have

165
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,400
an airplane who is able to do an

166
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:43,440
eight-hour

167
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:46,719
flight if you

168
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:48,639
uh in the 60s we have uh airplanes with

169
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:51,440
uh jet engines so we can

170
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:52,479
do a little bit further and faster so

171
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,960
maybe we can do

172
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:55,840
still do long london berlin but you can

173
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,878
do see

174
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:01,840
to london new york or london

175
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:02,639
paris to new york as well and we have a

176
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:06,960
little bit

177
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:10,560
more network so you can go a little bit

178
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:13,520
in eight hour further

179
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:17,520
so and you can see the cones start to be

180
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,520
to be a little bit shaped and steeper

181
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:26,799
uh in the 80s and the last

182
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:29,679
half of the last part of the

183
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,879
20th century we have the supersonic

184
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:33,200
aircraft the concorde

185
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:36,240
and a little bit of time the triple f

186
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:39,200
one triple f was able to make that

187
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:41,839
you can watch further you can go in

188
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,839
eight hours you can

189
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:46,480
make a very big travel but the concord

190
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:50,720
was only six hours

191
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:53,279
autonomy so and there was only two

192
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,240
destinations from new york it was paris

193
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:57,439
or london

194
00:08:54,240 --> 00:09:01,279
and we were on but that's it so

195
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:04,959
the network was very narrow at the time

196
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:06,839
so you can see the the cone are very

197
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:10,239
steeper and

198
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:13,040
choppy sharp sorry

199
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,880
and after the end of the commercial use

200
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:18,240
of concord

201
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:21,200
we are back at the same point in the 60s

202
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,200
with jet airplanes

203
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,959
the autonomy is a little bit better they

204
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:30,160
can go a little bit far

205
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:30,160
faster but not so much but the

206
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:35,360
network the airport networks is much

207
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:37,200
more dense

208
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,680
so you say oh you speak about

209
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:43,680
acceleration

210
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:46,399
if you combine things you can make

211
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,359
represent acceleration so we have the

212
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:50,720
same

213
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:55,040
visualization like mac air

214
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:55,040
and we have something like um

215
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:05,440
and you see where it's acceleration the

216
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:09,839
transportation modes can accelerate and

217
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:11,839
then now uh get slower

218
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:13,200
so this is one of the this is the

219
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:16,480
capabilities and the

220
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:18,560
main goal of the streaming project

221
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,839
i will be talking a little bit more of

222
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:24,079
this project

223
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:26,959
in the okay this means to

224
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:28,479
represent a complex reality uh it's for

225
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:31,839
research applications

226
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:33,200
there is no practical use but it's it

227
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:35,760
tackles uh

228
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:39,360
things from cartography computer

229
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:41,760
graphics and scientific vision

230
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,120
uh it's a free open source software and

231
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:46,000
mostly in

232
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:47,279
javascript you can find the code on

233
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,200
github

234
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:55,240
and find the uh the

235
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:59,440
research blog on ipotessport

236
00:10:55,240 --> 00:11:02,480
timespace.ipotes.org and we have a small

237
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,680
small team so feel free to join and if

238
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:13,600
you have any questions

239
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:17,279
i'm here for you thank you

240
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:21,760
um have you uh

241
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:25,360
used this into comparing

242
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:28,399
soft notes transportation between cities

243
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:32,000
and walkability indexes

244
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:32,000
actually no the only

245
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:38,880
so you you asked me if you we

246
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:39,920
used it for slow modes actually in

247
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:42,720
cities

248
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:44,959
yeah actually no the only application we

249
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:48,160
use it the only dataset we

250
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:51,599
use are airports position and

251
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:55,439
comparison between flight mode and

252
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,440
terrestrial transportation modes

253
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:59,279
maybe you can do that but you need the

254
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:02,480
data for that

255
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:05,200
sorry the point i was

256
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,160
thinking about is that in terms of city

257
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,360
planning

258
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:12,079
sometimes we want to see can we

259
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:13,040
create more spaces for certain soft

260
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:16,079
modes

261
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:19,199
uh cycling and ladders and so

262
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:21,359
what is the difference um

263
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:23,200
which would make maybe this project

264
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:26,399
could help visualizing this

265
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:27,279
yeah maybe it can be uh helpful for city

266
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:30,000
planning but

267
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:30,480
uh we don't have any data set and it's

268
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,800
not

269
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:38,079
all um subject to but maybe you can

270
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,719
contact us and try to work with us it

271
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:41,040
might be

272
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:52,240
interesting yeah thank you thank you

273
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:52,240
very much
