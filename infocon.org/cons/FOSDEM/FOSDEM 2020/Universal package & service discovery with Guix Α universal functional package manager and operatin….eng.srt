00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:10,000
hello everyone

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,719
today i'll talk about the question of

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,559
searching

4
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:16,640
and discovering software in general

5
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:18,000
in the world of computing and more

6
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:21,359
specifically when it comes to

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,759
the geeks package manager so

8
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:25,439
um actually a couple of years ago so

9
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,160
there was this guy he invented the world

10
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:31,519
wide web

11
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:33,360
in 1989 and uh 20 years later

12
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:34,800
he gave this ted talk which i think is

13
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:38,079
quite amazing i really recommend it

14
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:42,319
uh in the next web and um

15
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:44,000
asking about um the linking of data so

16
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,840
it's a good thing to put data there on

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,120
the internet but how do we find it

18
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,079
and how do we correlate data with each

19
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,199
other

20
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:52,719
uh that's a very good question i mean

21
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:54,320
it's a very general question and i think

22
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:56,960
it really applies to

23
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:59,359
software as well how we find packages

24
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:01,840
and how packages relate to each other

25
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:04,480
um and not just packages i'm talking

26
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,480
about this system

27
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,680
um so

28
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,200
so i think what it implies here yeah is

29
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,439
that today we have this uh package

30
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,600
representatives there's the app stores

31
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:18,880
and if you already know what you're

32
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,640
looking for uh

33
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,960
you know this amazing software called

34
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,520
vlc so you look it up you install it and

35
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,559
it works

36
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:29,119
but what if you're looking for a concept

37
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,000
so how to backup my data if you don't

38
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:33,200
have the name i mean

39
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,680
this is very tribal knowledge we like

40
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:38,400
a lot of those programs will be

41
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,400
basically uh

42
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,520
based on the popularity um

43
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:46,720
but what about the rest i mean what

44
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:48,640
about those more exotic features so

45
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:50,720
new fields or things we simply don't

46
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:54,560
know so we like to

47
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:57,039
to be able to discover more efficiently

48
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,680
now there is something else as well um

49
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,320
so

50
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,320
i like um

51
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,000
have you ever heard of dot files so

52
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,279
those little configuration files you put

53
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,840
in your home folder

54
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,479
to configure your text editor your web

55
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,599
browser

56
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:13,840
or anything so it's not a program

57
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:15,119
and typically those file configuration

58
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,040
files are stored in what we call this

59
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:20,000
dot file repository

60
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,040
uh uh quick show hands uh how many

61
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,760
people here have

62
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:26,319
ever written some configuration file on

63
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,319
a computer

64
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,920
okay it works yeah a little bit stressed

65
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,040
about this because

66
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:34,238
no one raised their hand would have been

67
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:37,599
in a big file so um

68
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:38,239
the i actually did uh try this query on

69
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:41,280
github

70
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:44,319
and it returned some 130k

71
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:46,000
130 000.5 repository on github

72
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:47,440
uh i think it's insane i don't know what

73
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,120
you think about it but

74
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:51,440
if i don't if we say there's an average

75
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,519
of a thousand lines per repository

76
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,800
that's some millions of lines of code

77
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:57,840
that are

78
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:00,480
um well used by

79
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,440
individual people but not really put to

80
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,200
the common goods

81
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,800
out there to be to be reused and to be

82
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,958
shared so essentially don't find

83
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:10,000
something personal

84
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:12,640
they are not really um those are general

85
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
you know they don't take this very

86
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:17,119
general approach to these

87
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:20,159
programs so

88
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,640
um i had this situation that maybe we

89
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:24,798
can

90
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:27,040
um start putting into this craziness and

91
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:29,840
start being a bit more general

92
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,760
and by this i mean that essentially what

93
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:35,760
the dot fair is that it implements

94
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:38,239
a particular workflow that you have

95
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:40,159
for instance if you think of a backup

96
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:42,799
you maybe write this backup script

97
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:44,798
that we'll call some ssh vpn connection

98
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:46,319
whatever and use all things to transfer

99
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:48,400
the data

100
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:49,679
and really i think we can be more

101
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,000
general than that so if you have this

102
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:54,080
framework for services

103
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,680
uh so just like system services but

104
00:03:54,080 --> 00:04:00,000
maybe also user services

105
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:01,680
so essentially those little declarative

106
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,480
snippets that tell you what you want to

107
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,400
do and once you've gotten it set up

108
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,079
you can really really share it with

109
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,760
everyone else i mean this

110
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,680
becomes very trivial and much less

111
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:14,879
personal

112
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:16,400
i'll give you an example so in using

113
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:20,560
some x expressions

114
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:22,400
we could declare uh at the global level

115
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,000
so for everyone we could declare this a

116
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:27,359
backup service type

117
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,639
and then program it so it takes

118
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,520
different fields

119
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:33,120
it holds the port for the server and

120
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,560
what's uh what would be very interesting

121
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,800
here is that you get

122
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,960
those two fields um all sync plus vpn

123
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:41,759
could be the way you want to do it

124
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,080
and this is where you can specialize and

125
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:44,000
this

126
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,840
is where very obviously your own folders

127
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,280
so that's also where you specialize

128
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,198
but what's really cool about this is

129
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,000
that the specialized part is only three

130
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:52,960
lines

131
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,160
so you don't need a huge script or

132
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,880
multiple scripts actually

133
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,080
to bundle together to get your features

134
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,919
running

135
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:02,560
you can do we can be more generally

136
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:05,280
distributed so that we save everyone

137
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,280
working time

138
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,080
so how do we how do we do this um i

139
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,600
think there's another talk

140
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,520
happening later about systemd and home

141
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,600
day it's very similar

142
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,639
uh so we already have this um listing

143
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,520
that's working

144
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:21,280
or um well since with this room why not

145
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,960
new gigs and new shepard

146
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,719
and what's i find great about this is

147
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,960
that you can install new geeks

148
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:29,199
with shepard on any system like new

149
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:31,840
linux distribution

150
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:33,520
and um well it just works so it's quite

151
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,440
universal everyone can use it so it's

152
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:38,719
very easy to share

153
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:39,280
and what's also particularly interesting

154
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,919
about

155
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:43,119
shepherd and geeks is that they can be

156
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:45,039
tied together

157
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:48,080
in a way that when you declare a service

158
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:50,639
in shepherd you will automatically

159
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:52,400
drank the required dependencies so with

160
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:55,280
my previous

161
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,280
um no

162
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:00,560
a previous example here uh from my user

163
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:02,479
uh dot files i can just put this service

164
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:05,680
there i don't have to install

165
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:07,599
a vpn program or rsync

166
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,800
it will do it for me automatically so i

167
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,600
don't have to care anymore about the

168
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,759
implementation

169
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,039
implementation details which are the

170
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:14,319
underlying programs

171
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:16,560
i don't care about this i want to get

172
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:17,280
the job done i want to i want to do the

173
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,880
backup

174
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:21,840
that's really what i care the rest of

175
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,840
your details

176
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:28,080
um so back to

177
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:30,880
uh let's leave the services aside for a

178
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:34,159
moment and back to the packages

179
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:35,520
um next next to us um it's a boring

180
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,240
distribution these things

181
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,840
has some 40 000 plus packages um it's

182
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:43,280
pretty huge right

183
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:46,638
uh gex is getting there um very slowly

184
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:49,758
so with some 12 000 packages so

185
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:51,520
imagine i mean um do you really know

186
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:53,520
this package i mean have you ever

187
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,198
brought us through the list

188
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,560
uh it's really hard to find your way

189
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:58,479
around i mean you probably

190
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,639
you can probably browse at least by the

191
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:03,120
programs that you already know

192
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:04,880
like vlc and so on but what if you have

193
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,880
to discover something there i mean

194
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,319
we need a good search system we need we

195
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:12,000
need to link the data

196
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:14,000
so that we can uh explore more

197
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,360
humanly more efficiently so it speaks to

198
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,400
us we're not machines where we cannot

199
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,759
browse

200
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:22,799
40 000 packages so

201
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:22,800
with some problems here

202
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:34,000
um uh if you've um

203
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:35,758
so a lot of package managers have

204
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,880
support for searching fires

205
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:42,840
uh within packages for instance um

206
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:45,599
if you know down mercurial

207
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:47,758
vcs a version control system uh the

208
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:50,400
executive one is actually called hg

209
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:52,240
so if you're looking for hd you might

210
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,719
not find mercurial or vice versa

211
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,479
so you need a system that supports both

212
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,360
uh a lot of package managers actually

213
00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:01,199
support it

214
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:03,280
geeks doesn't and but not all of them

215
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:05,120
are smart enough to have this uh search

216
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:07,599
system that will

217
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,199
uh they'll actually look it up both in

218
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:11,759
files and in the description on the

219
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:14,879
package name and all those things

220
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:16,720
in general you you do the fast search

221
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:18,879
separately from the package search i

222
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:21,840
think we could blend those too

223
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:23,360
so i think and since this is missing

224
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:26,239
from geeks i think we can implement this

225
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:30,720
this way that would be pretty cool

226
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:33,360
another problem is that of um well the

227
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,919
uh so-called gen 2 used flags if you use

228
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,479
gen 2

229
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:38,000
or on next thing is called the the

230
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:40,640
package overrides

231
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,399
so we may have different features within

232
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:45,360
a package itself

233
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:46,480
so for instance you may build um a

234
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,120
browser with

235
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,640
different types of backends or maybe gtk

236
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,640
or cute

237
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:54,080
and then you don't really get the same

238
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,680
package in here i mean you have one

239
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,040
build with some features another one i

240
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,079
mean the same package built with other

241
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,360
features

242
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:02,080
and then we have a different type of

243
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:04,480
granularity we want to

244
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,440
uh also know about the features that are

245
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,959
at this level

246
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:11,600
at this granular level then um

247
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:13,119
and one let's uh complex topic actually

248
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,959
but it would be nice to be able to

249
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:19,120
just like for fries to be able to search

250
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:19,119
for features within programs as well

251
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:25,360
um so i was talking about search before

252
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,760
and that means that um we need good

253
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,839
search

254
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,200
um i think a lot of package managers

255
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:31,440
don't have good search

256
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:33,440
and maybe it's easier to just find to

257
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,720
just do an internet query to actually

258
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,000
find what you're looking for

259
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,959
and that's a problem we should be able

260
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:42,320
to do it from the distribution itself

261
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:43,680
so i think we need a good tooling a good

262
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,839
user interface

263
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,800
in particular a good way um i mean we

264
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:48,480
want to

265
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:52,319
to make this very accessible to all of

266
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,320
us not just common line gurus

267
00:09:54,800 --> 00:10:01,040
then um so going back to link data

268
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,720
how does it work what is linked data

269
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,319
when it comes to packages

270
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,760
because they don't necessarily have they

271
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,120
don't the package itself doesn't know

272
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,279
about a relation with another

273
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:12,720
except for the dependencies but what if

274
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:15,760
uh the two video players are mpv and vlc

275
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:17,600
well maybe they're not related well

276
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,959
on the software level but are related in

277
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,120
the meaning

278
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:22,079
in their purpose right they're both

279
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,640
video players

280
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:25,439
so here we need a system to have some

281
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:28,640
human input

282
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:30,640
that says um okay this is how we

283
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,760
categorize things and they belong to the

284
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:35,439
same category

285
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:38,720
so you can start um adding this um

286
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:39,680
humanization of the search domain among

287
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,640
packages

288
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:44,399
then well of then those are very typical

289
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:47,519
features that you get from

290
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:49,600
app stores etc you get the number of

291
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:52,240
downloads the ratings all those things

292
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,600
uh why does it matter i think it

293
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,839
actually matters because it

294
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,440
gives us additional data about how much

295
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:59,600
a program is used

296
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,560
so for instance the number of donors or

297
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,279
ratings

298
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:04,880
uh maybe we should focus a little bit on

299
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:06,240
the most popular package because we want

300
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,920
to make sure that they work

301
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,519
but actually more interestingly we want

302
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,319
to focus on the least popular package

303
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:13,440
because

304
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:16,240
if we have it and only a few people

305
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:18,079
care about it and it breaks well chances

306
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,399
are that no one is going to fix it

307
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:21,920
so with that kind of data we have a

308
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:24,160
better perspective on

309
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:26,160
what should be what should get special

310
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:29,519
attention

311
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:32,480
um the last uh the last entry here tanks

312
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:33,120
uh put with a question mark because um

313
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,640
uh we

314
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:37,200
would tend to think that maybe tanks

315
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,160
should belong to the package metadata

316
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,160
human input

317
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:42,959
you would say like um vsc should have

318
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:45,120
the hashtag video tag

319
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:47,359
um but maybe not actually the problem

320
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:51,279
with tags is that they're essentially

321
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:52,880
very subjective they um

322
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:54,399
they they go over they go with time with

323
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,399
them with a different

324
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:58,560
fashion so maybe today we'll talk about

325
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:00,079
clouds uh maybe this term go out of

326
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,359
fashion you know in five years

327
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:03,199
and talk about something else so the

328
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,000
word cloud will not be meaningful

329
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,160
anymore

330
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,440
so in that sense i think tags uh should

331
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:11,839
be very dynamic um

332
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,839
very volatile

333
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:16,959
so um so what does it mean to be

334
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,959
searching um

335
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:22,560
i think so this is basically um

336
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:25,279
combining everything i said so far

337
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:26,959
into one single interface so don't have

338
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:28,720
don't separate the search

339
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:30,239
for different components we don't want

340
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:33,279
to have a separate search for files

341
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:35,600
for features for the community data

342
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:36,480
we want to just write my package manager

343
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:40,079
search

344
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:43,120
or even from a nice guy

345
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:45,519
um and right uh well

346
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,160
you query i mean now i want to back up

347
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:48,160
my data

348
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:49,680
and it should return the relevant stuff

349
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,120
and that's that would be really amazing

350
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:53,839
right you don't have to care much more

351
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,839
about it

352
00:12:54,240 --> 00:13:00,240
so um for um

353
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:02,560
so for the for with regard to the detail

354
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:06,240
implementation details

355
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:08,800
um so wikidata do you know wikideo

356
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,800
show hands

357
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:15,279
okay so it's surprisingly not so popular

358
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:16,880
but well right here i guess we have a

359
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:19,600
select audience

360
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:20,399
um wicked anna has this amazing project

361
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:24,000
where

362
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:25,440
it's a wiki by the wikimedia nation

363
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,120
where everything every object every

364
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:30,160
entity every concept on the planet

365
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:34,560
is indexed and has two properties so

366
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:38,240
typically you have the webs here

367
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:41,920
um yeah if i do this yesterday up here

368
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:45,040
so this is a wiki data entry and

369
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:48,319
um so it shows uh it chose the languages

370
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:50,000
um different terms the kind of instance

371
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,720
it is if it's software library video

372
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,399
player

373
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,000
you get the logo you get all those

374
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:57,600
different things the

375
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,440
inception date so

376
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,959
what's really cool with uh wikidata i

377
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,279
said well it's a wiki so even if it's

378
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,839
too

379
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:04,720
free to edit it and you can put all

380
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:08,079
those

381
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:11,600
human uh inputs in there so that could

382
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:11,599
be a very nice interface that we could

383
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:18,320
exploit to actually make use of this

384
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:20,639
community driven data

385
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,639
sorry

386
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:30,000
next um well that's uh i know to myself

387
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:32,399
some sort of um so how do you how do you

388
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,480
make this search engine uh practically

389
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:35,600
like package manager search anything and

390
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,880
it finds what you want

391
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,720
i think you need something really smart

392
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:41,600
here zapkin is a

393
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:43,199
nice implementation that uses a lot of

394
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:46,560
those um

395
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:48,639
um it links between the 10 words and so

396
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:50,399
on so it allows you to actually

397
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:52,320
uh support just the meaning of what

398
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:54,079
you're trying to to search and and

399
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,600
return the most relevant results it's

400
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:56,560
pretty amazing uh if you don't know they

401
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,000
can check it out

402
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:00,638
and if you do something better please

403
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,639
reach out to me

404
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:15,279
okay so um the good news is that i'm

405
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:16,639
actually working on it

406
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:19,519
uh i've received a grant from the

407
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:20,240
internet foundation and i would like to

408
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,600
address

409
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:24,480
more or less all the points i mentioned

410
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:25,760
today and i would like to do it on geeks

411
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,079
because i believe that

412
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:29,839
it's a very good package manager and

413
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:31,839
well as i mentioned before it's

414
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:34,480
universal anyone can use it so

415
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:35,519
i'm not doing the work for just a subset

416
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:40,720
of the distributions

417
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:44,959
that could actually apply to everyone

418
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:46,880
yeah sorry so

419
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:48,399
uh that would be this is basically to

420
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:50,720
sum up um

421
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:54,399
the five different steps that would be

422
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:57,120
to implement all this

423
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:58,240
and um here if you're interested it's a

424
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,240
little bit of a

425
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,839
side comment but finished interested by

426
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,040
the nnf foundation the

427
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:05,279
if you're working on free software

428
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:07,439
project check them out there they have

429
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:08,800
quite a lot of money so that would you

430
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:11,519
would be more than welcome to

431
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,519
to protect them

432
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,680
and last but not least if you want to

433
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:16,720
follow up on geeks development it'll be

434
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,719
there and

435
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:21,199
this is my personal website my blog i

436
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:24,240
will be posting there my progress

437
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:25,300
and i hope that we be successful

438
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:29,650
thank you very much

439
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:29,650
[Applause]

440
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:35,440
questions and please repeat the question

441
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:38,479
so it comes on video

442
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:41,600
yes have you think uh

443
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:44,480
how you you prefer to

444
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:46,399
do the the publishing of this how for

445
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:48,480
example i develop a tool

446
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:52,160
for doing a special task and i say to

447
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:54,160
you okay i want to publish it

448
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:55,519
how you you are thinking about it having

449
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:58,240
a central repository

450
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:59,600
i have to submit the request or just put

451
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:02,079
it somewhere on it

452
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:04,559
that's a very good question um i don't

453
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:05,359
know and i think that's okay this is not

454
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:08,480
part of my work

455
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:10,719
oh my word project nah

456
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,959
i think this is you know a central

457
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:15,199
question how do we

458
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:17,439
uh publish programs on internet because

459
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:19,839
yeah we can set up a repository but

460
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:21,439
well in the end uh if no one knows about

461
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:24,000
it how do we find it

462
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:27,360
yeah that's a good question um i don't

463
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,359
i'm sorry i don't have a good answer to

464
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:35,199
this

465
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:36,699
so here would it be an idea you know to

466
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:39,600
take the results of uh

467
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:42,160
[Music]

468
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,280
um to actually feed the results into

469
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:45,039
wiki data rather than

470
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,399
just usually key data yeah that would be

471
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:49,840
really good as well yeah

472
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:53,039
so maybe have some uh

473
00:17:49,840 --> 00:18:01,840
bi-directional yeah definitely

474
00:17:53,039 --> 00:18:01,840
all right thank you very much

475
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,360
you
