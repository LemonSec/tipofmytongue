1
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:09,440
we are

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:10,160
a bit behind schedule but um now we come

3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:13,440
to our

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:17,840
last lightning talk for today it's omar

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:21,759
akram and he will talk about desk on the

6
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:25,759
secure cross-platform ipc on the network

7
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,760
please welcome omar aquam

8
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,080
hi

9
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:36,000
okay so i'll quickly quickly

10
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,840
start and make it quick and make sure

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,480
that we end on time

12
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:42,840
uh my name is omar kram i come from

13
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:45,839
pakistan

14
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,840
and

15
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,640
well i come from pakistan and i have

16
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:54,160
been part of the

17
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:58,320
a core developer team at crossbar io

18
00:00:54,160 --> 00:01:00,160
it's a german company that that kind of

19
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,239
sponsors the development of autobahn

20
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:04,158
websocket and ramp libraries we also

21
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:07,920
developed the crossbar

22
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:09,680
vamp router um recently we are actually

23
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,799
working on developing a

24
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:15,360
data market that is distributed so that

25
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:16,640
no single entity controls the data

26
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,640
so we are working with different

27
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:22,479
companies uh

28
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:24,840
as part of that project which obviously

29
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:26,320
should show something in in the next few

30
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,840
months

31
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:30,000
um i've been part of the ubuntu

32
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,640
community for more than 10 years

33
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,200
and maybe the next month would actually

34
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,520
be

35
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,960
a the 10th year where i become where

36
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,320
when i became the ubuntu community

37
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,520
member officially

38
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:44,639
and ubuntu kind of sponsored my

39
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:46,399
trip here as well and uh and finally i

40
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,320
was a q engineer at canonical before the

41
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:52,079
famous layoff that happened

42
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:54,798
uh so uh i'll quickly talk about the

43
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:55,439
wamp protocol itself vamp was initially

44
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:58,479
defined

45
00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:01,360
as a sub protocol for web sockets

46
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:03,200
uh the proposition was that because

47
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:05,200
websocket itself was

48
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:08,000
end to end and then you have a you have

49
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:10,239
a server and you have a client

50
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,160
so something that was missing was if if

51
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:12,879
someone wanted to do remote procedure

52
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,760
calls

53
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:17,280
or if someone wanted to route that

54
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,879
traffic to other computers they would

55
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,239
have to develop those semantics

56
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:22,959
themselves

57
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:23,680
what the vam protocol does is it

58
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:26,000
introduces

59
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:28,319
remote procedure calls and publish

60
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:32,239
subscribe on top of websockets

61
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:34,160
and it kind of allows you to be able to

62
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:38,640
write responsive websites with

63
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:38,640
decoupled services um

64
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,239
so with feedback from implementers we

65
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,280
actually

66
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:46,959
changed the protocol uh like

67
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,360
in such a way that now any

68
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:50,319
bi-directional reliable transport could

69
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,200
be used so

70
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:54,879
it's not really tied to websocket now uh

71
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,238
any other transport could be used maybe

72
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:59,120
we will be doing

73
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:02,239
uh transport based on top of quick that

74
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:05,519
someone was talking today as well

75
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:06,720
so and all obviously zeroconf is a

76
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:09,680
technology

77
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,720
that's uh uh that's used for service

78
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,200
discovery and

79
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,959
name resolution on the local network uh

80
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,040
and seems like someone disabled

81
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,000
multicast on this wi-fi network so i had

82
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,079
to

83
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,280
create a hotspot on my own device to be

84
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,400
able to do stuff

85
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,200
uh i'm assuming that's due to making

86
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,080
sure that

87
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,280
the traffic doesn't go crazy and the

88
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,480
routers

89
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,480
are able to sustain that

90
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:37,680
so i the main thing is this this is the

91
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:39,840
project that i wanted to talk about this

92
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:42,080
is called desk on it's your connection

93
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,920
to your uh it's your computer's

94
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,239
connection to different things

95
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:48,559
uh your computer could be a raspberry pi

96
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:52,560
it could be your desktop itself

97
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:54,799
uh in in some cases uh it could be your

98
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,319
mobile phone which is right now for

99
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:57,599
example my mobile phone is connected to

100
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,560
my computer and it's actually

101
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:00,480
controlling

102
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,159
uh these slides i'm obviously not

103
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:05,280
pressing keyboard buttons

104
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:09,040
there but i'm doing these

105
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:11,120
rpc calls that are like these procedures

106
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:13,120
are exposed by my computer and i'm just

107
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,959
pushing them from here

108
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,040
this is not something like a

109
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,320
groundbreaking or this software is not

110
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,759
groundbreaking obviously

111
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:22,240
many people have done that in the past

112
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:24,479
as well uh but i just hacked this around

113
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,440
last night so i could do something for

114
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:28,000
this

115
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:30,160
um how it started well as most of the

116
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,960
open source projects start it started as

117
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:35,040
something that i was trying to scratch

118
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,599
my itch like i had some use cases at my

119
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,080
home

120
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,919
i wanted to control the gpio pins

121
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,639
running on an ubuntu core device on my

122
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:42,320
home

123
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:44,000
i have this home automation project

124
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:46,800
which kind of

125
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,320
balances load on in my home uh using

126
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,360
solar power for example

127
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:54,240
in in the time of 10 am to

128
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,199
4 pm i want to be able to run as much as

129
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,320
load on that

130
00:04:55,199 --> 00:05:01,520
as possible and so

131
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:03,280
i wrote this thing to be able to control

132
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,240
these gpio pins from a mobile phone or

133
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:07,359
my computer

134
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:09,600
for that sense and obviously at a later

135
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,000
stage i wanted i worked in a co-working

136
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,400
space

137
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,600
and one of the a problem that came up

138
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,359
for me was

139
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,039
in some cases you forget to dock your

140
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,039
desktop screen and you move away

141
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:21,440
and you have this constant fear that

142
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:24,320
someone might poke into your computer so

143
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:26,320
what i implemented was i wrote i exposed

144
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:29,360
an interface from my computer and

145
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:30,880
hooked it to that diamond and ultimately

146
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:33,199
it was controlled by my

147
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:35,120
mobile phone so whenever i stepped away

148
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:36,000
from my desktop i could actually check

149
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,880
my phone

150
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,600
and that if i forgot to lock it and i

151
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,600
could

152
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,720
actually lock the desktop screen uh

153
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,880
obviously this was

154
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,960
working on most linux distributions i

155
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:51,199
tested the kubuntu

156
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:53,520
uh ubuntu and a few others well light dm

157
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:54,720
was working gdm and a few other display

158
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:58,400
managers were working quite

159
00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:02,400
fine um and then this thing

160
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:04,159
um so i think most mostly we know that

161
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,840
if you watch netflix on your mobile

162
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,360
phone when you go to full screen it

163
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,400
automatically raises the brightness of

164
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,080
the device

165
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:12,318
this is something that was missing for

166
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:14,000
desktops so i wrote a chrome extension

167
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:15,759
to be able to do that

168
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,360
a chrome extension would send a request

169
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:18,960
to the demon running on my desktop it

170
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,199
would raise the brightness

171
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,638
uh well while talking well not talking

172
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:23,520
direct well it would actually write

173
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:26,639
those

174
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:27,919
values to the backlight driver on my

175
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:30,800
linux based system

176
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:31,599
so these were some of the use cases that

177
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,720
called me

178
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:36,160
to write that thing initially it was all

179
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:39,039
coupled together but

180
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,639
with time given the use cases i kind of

181
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:42,000
broke it down into different components

182
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,720
so that it could be

183
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,560
reused by different people trying to

184
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,800
implement different use cases or

185
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,759
any scenarios that may come up from them

186
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,440
so

187
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:53,599
at the core of this technology is a

188
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:56,240
router it's called crossbar right now

189
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:58,560
i'm using that router

190
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,400
you could implement something for

191
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:03,120
discovery obviously i use this python

192
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:04,880
library python xerocon for discovery so

193
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,440
whenever this server starts on a local

194
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,719
network

195
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:11,120
it's discoverable by other devices and

196
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,880
you could hook in different clients one

197
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,080
client obviously in this case is my

198
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:17,199
mobile phone

199
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:19,120
the other uh could be a raspberry pi or

200
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:20,479
it could also be my desktop well there

201
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,120
is a client running on my desktop as

202
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:24,240
well

203
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:26,080
the cli used to do the pairing you run a

204
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,000
command on your desktop to

205
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:29,599
generate a key code that then you put in

206
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,199
your mobile phone which actually allows

207
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:33,599
you to create these devices for security

208
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:33,599
reasons

209
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,680
and obviously it's cross-platform the

210
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:41,280
technology that's

211
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:44,560
being used here pretty much

212
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:47,198
runs on all platforms uh it works

213
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,879
on windows on linux on mac uh the core

214
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,520
thing the thing that's doing all the

215
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:51,199
routing

216
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:53,280
and all the remote procedure calls and

217
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:54,879
the security layer uh that is cross

218
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,400
platform and then the multicast dns

219
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:58,000
which i already said

220
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,719
isn't working on this environment but

221
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,800
obviously uh it's pretty mature enough

222
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,000
that apple itself uses its in most of

223
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:07,039
its devices and

224
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,680
uh many uh many

225
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:11,840
amazon tablets are also using that uh

226
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,599
well in on linux we have awahe but i'm

227
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:15,679
not sure if we are using it that much

228
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:19,919
apart from the printing stack but

229
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:22,800
uh that is how it is

230
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:23,758
and okay so i came up with this little

231
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,639
piece of code that i

232
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:26,879
wrote last night for the most part this

233
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:29,759
is

234
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,800
what's exposing the functionality on my

235
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:34,320
desktop this is

236
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:36,560
talking to you input to

237
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,719
send key events so these are four key

238
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:40,718
events that i

239
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:42,399
assigned to different room procedure

240
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:44,959
rpcs uh

241
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:45,680
so which i'm calling from here right now

242
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:47,920
obviously

243
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,599
uh that there is one for stopping and

244
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,240
starting and then there is next and

245
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,399
previous

246
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,320
this is being controlled this is for the

247
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:56,399
most part sending key events then

248
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,440
the right arrow key the left arrow key

249
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:59,839
well actually

250
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:01,680
and the f5 and another key i don't know

251
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:04,240
which one is that i don't remember it

252
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,800
right now that's page down page up

253
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:08,560
escape

254
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:10,479
and uh f5 key okay so this is the

255
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,599
simplest code that that is running on my

256
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,200
computer which is exposing this

257
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,360
functionality

258
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,120
and here is the overall picture of this

259
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,360
thing uh i wanted to do

260
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:21,279
like this architect of this thing the

261
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:24,000
diamond itself which is running

262
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:24,880
uh which is the router is running on my

263
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,160
desktop

264
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,959
i've called it tescon b inspired by lexd

265
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:32,160
and systemd

266
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:34,160
the naming obviously um then

267
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:36,000
there is an android client there is a

268
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:39,680
chrome extension which is called

269
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:43,440
bright flicks uh which tries

270
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:45,599
uh to like race which obviously monitors

271
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,440
netflix.com and whenever it goes full

272
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:50,000
screen it sends a signal to the

273
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,839
diamond which forwards that signal to

274
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,560
the other component that's running on my

275
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:55,440
desktop and

276
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,560
that raises the screen brightness and

277
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,200
for my home

278
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:01,279
use case i already told about the picon

279
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:03,760
that is also another project that's

280
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:05,120
sub project of this umbrella project

281
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:08,160
pycon is your

282
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:11,360
raspberry pi's connection to things and

283
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:13,519
right now that component is only

284
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,800
being used to control the gpio pins on

285
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:17,519
that thing and

286
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:18,079
which is producing quite a lot of saving

287
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:21,600
for me

288
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:23,359
as as it comes to uh using that solar

289
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:26,880
system in my home

290
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:30,000
and so this is

291
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:32,720
snaps obviously since i mostly use

292
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,880
linux-based systems on my computer so

293
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:37,440
much of this is being shipped as snaps

294
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:38,399
and they are the first their first class

295
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:42,320
citizens here

296
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:45,279
obviously they they simplify application

297
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,720
delivery story very much and due to the

298
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:48,560
fact that snaps are

299
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,240
uh you can use snapcraft to build

300
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:53,359
different packages remotely on

301
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,800
on canonical provided servers uh you get

302
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:57,680
free rbhf

303
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:59,040
bills that that are very essential for

304
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:01,040
me to be able to run those

305
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,719
my software and on the raspberry pi

306
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,519
because trying to build something on the

307
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,079
raspberry pi

308
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:07,519
is a is a resource killer and it also

309
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:10,560
takes quite a few

310
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:12,640
hours in some cases to do that so

311
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,959
this service obviously kind of helps me

312
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:17,040
do that and obviously they are secured

313
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:20,160
because

314
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:21,439
you input in itself is very dangerous to

315
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,519
expose to anyone

316
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,360
uh right now i've been talking to the

317
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:28,480
ubuntu guys to be

318
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:30,880
able to allow that they haven't allowed

319
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,640
there isn't an interface for you input

320
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:35,279
to be accessed in a

321
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:36,399
confined snap because you are talking

322
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:39,040
directly

323
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:39,760
uh to slash flash u input which which is

324
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:43,519
very

325
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:47,279
a let's say open for

326
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:49,920
a key in key event

327
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:51,600
and we cannot afford that because a bad

328
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,719
actor could do lots of different things

329
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,120
that

330
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,760
most of the people wouldn't really want

331
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,880
things

332
00:11:55,760 --> 00:12:01,040
to be and what's next

333
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:02,639
i the project obviously is hosted on

334
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,079
github i've been doing

335
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:05,680
active development of this thing for the

336
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:09,199
last few months uh

337
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:10,800
well i was quite busy for the last two

338
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:13,200
three months so the development pace

339
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:16,880
isn't that fast as it used to be

340
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:19,519
a while back ago but uh now that uh

341
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:20,880
i do uh plan to do most of the changes

nobody okay then thanks again

363
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:28,399
oh there is one there is

364
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:29,519
the router where um where does the

365
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:32,720
router run on

366
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:33,760
on my pc yes on your pc because that's

367
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,880
where

368
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:38,959
these apis get exposed

369
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,920
so your route as soon as the router runs

370
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:42,399
on your pc

371
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,959
uh it sends its name on the local

372
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:45,279
network

373
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:46,479
using multicast dns so that other

374
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:49,600
computers on the network

375
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,240
are able to discover that so that

376
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,079
enables

377
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,440
easy access okay it's for the local

378
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:55,120
network yes it's

379
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:57,120
totally around the local network in

380
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,240
future there will be support for remote

381
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,760
access as well like

382
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:02,079
the router running on your computer will

383
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:04,079
be able to connect to a remote router

384
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:06,560
provided by me maybe or you would

385
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:07,120
also be able to host that and then you

386
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,199
could

387
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,240
do all these calls over the internet as

388
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:11,920
well there

389
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:14,880
the technology is there it's just a

390
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,880
matter of doing it

391
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:30,480
so another one yeah

392
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:32,560

393
