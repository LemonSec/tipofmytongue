1
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:08,320
so this

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:09,840
uh talk was actually submitted by my

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:11,920
colleague sudhir but he couldn't make it

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,440
unfortunately so

5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,960
he told me to present it i actually

6
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:17,920
don't work on this project

7
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,920
so i'll try my best

8
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:25,038
[Applause]

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,240
so so what i understand is this is a ds

10
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:28,640
code extension

11
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,240
with which you can connect to your

12
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:33,440
openshift cluster and uh

13
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:36,079
you can create your projects or pods

14
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:37,280
uh your deployments of right from the

15
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:41,760
ide

16
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:42,640
and uh so so the vs code intel is an

17
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,120
eclipse

18
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:47,039
i i think the all of them uses the same

19
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,599
core so the id is supported in all the

20
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:51,039
three

21
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:54,239
ids the extension

22
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:57,360
and uh here is an overview

23
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:59,839
so it it provides the

24
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,199
developer a way to create deploy and

25
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,440
debug these applications

26
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:05,519
directly from the id so that's that's

27
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:07,679
what the group in red hat does

28
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,640
we make in the developer tools or we

29
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,640
make tools

30
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,240
to make the developers life easier so

31
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,760
that yeah they don't have to jump

32
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,880
between windows and all

33
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:19,119
yeah and

34
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,240
the architecture the extension on the

35
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:24,320
backend it uses

36
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:26,320
audio openshift do and the oc cli tool

37
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:29,199
to actually talk to the cluster and uh

38
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:32,000
make those changes on the cluster

39
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,920
and the and the concepts that the

40
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,680
extension exports to the ide

41
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,439
other concepts from audio like a

42
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:41,040
component and app

43
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:44,158
i mean the from the demo we can see that

44
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:47,280
so uh this is the workflow

45
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:49,520
like if you install the install the

46
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,280
add-on in your id in your vs code id

47
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,280
this is what you would

48
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,200
actually follow you will code your

49
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,240
application in the ide

50
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,320
and and you'll push the code to debug or

51
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:02,798
deploy on the openshift cluster

52
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,320
and you can have a watch option so that

53
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:06,479
when you make changes to the code it

54
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:09,840
automatically deploys on the cluster and

55
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:09,840
yeah you get you see the results

56
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:17,200
um okay so this is uh like the basic

57
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:19,280
open shift

58
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,280
open shift things you can have a you can

59
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,680
build in the cluster from a base image

60
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:27,840
from a git repo from source code using

61
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,840
source to image building tools

62
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:35,280
okay the demo so i

63
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,000
tried the demo but yeah you can see the

64
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,239
error message

65
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,239
here

66
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:43,519
so so the so how do you get the

67
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:45,280
extension so to get the extension you go

68
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:49,120
to vs code marketplace

69
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:51,840
and search for open shift connector yeah

70
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,879
this one and we can install it and after

71
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,400
that we have this

72
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:59,840
open shift tab here and now uh so

73
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:04,000
the project that i work on is crc it's a

74
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:07,360
way to run local openshift cluster 4.4.x

75
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,360
cluster where is my terminal

76
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:13,519
ah yeah so so for the extent

77
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,680
extensive talk to something you need

78
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:18,159
actually a cluster so here i'm using a

79
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,760
local opencv photonex cluster which is

80
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:23,440
being

81
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,440
brought up by crc so

82
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:28,959
um it's i hope it's running it's running

83
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:36,959
and now i'm logged into the that cluster

84
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,080
and uh so these are the projects that

85
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,319
cluster has right now

86
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,080
on the developer name space and we can

87
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:46,000
verify that by

88
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:47,519
oc get projects yeah

89
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,799
yeah so these are the two projects so

90
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,840
you can see the same thing here on the

91
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:52,000
id

92
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:54,159
and on this namespace now i'm try i'll

93
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,159
try to create a new component

94
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:58,560
and this uh new component thing comes

95
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:59,599
from audio which is the id is using the

96
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:03,760
background

97
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:07,920
and i need to give a name just

98
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:12,560
demo first them

99
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:15,599
and i want it from a git repository

100
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,798
so and uh we need to give the context

101
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:18,320
folder this is where the

102
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:21,758
code will be copied and you'll make

103
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,759
changes locally on that folder

104
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,680
let's go to extra

105
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:34,080
okay and

106
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:43,840
so we have our node.js application

107
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:43,840
which we usually use for demos

108
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:56,719
yeah i had it in the clipboard

109
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:59,840
and let's use the head

110
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:01,120
and then you give a component name so if

111
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:06,239
need this

112
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:10,639
component tell what component is

113
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:12,960
using the version of the node.js and

114
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:13,919
so it created but it's it's not there in

115
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,880
the cluster yet

116
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:17,680
so so you have to push these changes to

117
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:21,199
the cluster

118
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,199
and which is actually not working

119
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:26,479
yeah so this is like

120
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,400
basic audio push command so you can do

121
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:32,000
these things using the cli tool

122
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:33,919
or audio and oc but to for developers to

123
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,280
make their life easier we have this

124
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:38,880
extension and you can do it right from

125
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:41,280
the id

126
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,880
and there are other things you can do

127
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,400
like in the in the command palette there

128
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,400
are other commands like

129
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,400
you can create uh com openshift

130
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,840
components directly from eml files that

131
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:52,479
you can push in

132
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:54,960
but yeah i i haven't really used those

133
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:54,960
things so

134
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:07,840
no it's not going to work

135
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,080
yes it does work so if you have a

136
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:34,080
cluster in your aws or something you can

137
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:37,520
connect this to that cluster

138
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:40,800
overweight is crc open source yes

139
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:41,758
okay and what um hypervisor are you

140
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:46,080
using on the map

141
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:46,080
uh hyperkit hyperkey

142
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:52,720
i mean you still need a red hat

143
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:55,719
developer account to pull the images

144
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:57,120
because four dot x okay d is not yet out

145
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:58,960
so once

146
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:02,960
okay yeah finish and everything like

147
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:05,758
that will be effectively

148
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:09,280
yeah okay so that's the thing yeah yeah

149
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,280
i'm happy to answer crc questions

150
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:18,479
so yeah it's

151
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:20,720
it's it's just it's not working for me

152
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,719
today

153
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,719
i mean that was the extension maybe

154
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,680
sudhir would have explained it

155
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,840
better but yeah this is what i could

156
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:44,720
manage

157
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:44,719
sorry thank you
