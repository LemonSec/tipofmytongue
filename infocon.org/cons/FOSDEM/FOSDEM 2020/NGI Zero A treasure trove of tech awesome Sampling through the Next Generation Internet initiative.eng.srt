00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:15,599
our next speaker is

2
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:16,400
michiel linov and he will be talking

3
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:19,439
about

4
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:20,320
ngi zero a treasure trove of tech

5
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:24,320
awesome

6
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,320
please welcome michelle linas

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,160
so hi folks um i'm very happy that you

8
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:32,320
uh

9
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,600
are going to spend your last hour on

10
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,160
foster in a room

11
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,040
with a guy talking about other people's

12
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:40,398
stuff

13
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:41,760
uh so uh just to give a very short intro

14
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:43,120
where i come from our first small

15
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,640
foundation called nlnet

16
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,800
and now that dates back to the beginning

17
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,960
of the internet in europe

18
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,959
and

19
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,160
basically what we try to do is fund

20
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:57,360
people that

21
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:59,199
make the internet a better place and we

22
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,600
do so always with open standards and

23
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:02,800
open

24
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,359
open source and open hardware so these

25
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,280
are

26
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,360
uh just just as reference things we

27
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:12,080
funded throughout the ages

28
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:13,920
um but uh for us it's important to

29
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,119
continue to keep in our mind that the

30
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,520
internet isn't finished

31
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:18,799
it's it's still quite a young technology

32
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,960
it's half a decade old

33
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:23,759
a half a half a century old but we are

34
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:26,960
still rewriting its history every day

35
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:29,600
and actually know uh since

36
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:31,839
at least in since snowden that we're in

37
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:35,039
quite a problematic internet as well

38
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:36,720
and and meanwhile we've seen

39
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,880
more than just whistleblowers we we've

40
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,640
seen that actually the whole ecosystem

41
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:43,119
as as it has developed

42
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,399
uh it has become quite toxic so so tim

43
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:45,119
bernsley for instance the guy who

44
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:47,360
invented the web

45
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:49,600
says we have demonstrated that the web

46
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:52,159
has failed instead of served humanity

47
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,880
he says the the the web has become a

48
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:56,079
large-scale

49
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:57,039
emergent anti-human phenomenon i mean

50
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:59,360
those are

51
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,079
if you know what an optimist that man is

52
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:03,280
then those are

53
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:04,320
really really strong words uh and it's

54
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,240
not just

55
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:09,119
the people that made it and the people

56
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,239
that uh that saw it from underneath but

57
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:11,360
it's actually also something that's

58
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:13,920
politically

59
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,040
uh getting some traction and this

60
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,879
sparked something called the next

61
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:19,200
generation internet and

62
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:20,079
uh um we've been involved with that

63
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,799
actually from the from

64
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,400
really early start on we we helped write

65
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,160
the vision for it which we presented two

66
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:29,040
years ago

67
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,040
and um

68
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,560
of course any vision is simplifying what

69
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,040
needs to be done

70
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,239
but the the three pillars that that it

71
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,359
is working towards is to make the

72
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,920
internet something that

73
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,280
is resilient and doesn't break something

74
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,000
that's trustworthy so that you don't

75
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,280
have to

76
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,280
depend on any party uh or

77
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,480
any commercial entity or any government

78
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,680
to do the right thing because the

79
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,840
technology does it

80
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,280
by itself and of course it has to be

81
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,720
sustainably

82
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:58,400
sustainable in terms of ecology but also

83
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,239
sustainable in terms of economy so the

84
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,000
extractive practices are not

85
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:03,440
part of the future that we see for the

86
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,599
internet

87
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,560
now after we wrote that vision we got a

88
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:09,920
lot of awesome

89
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:13,440
organizations together and we uh

90
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:15,440
we started giving out money to projects

91
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:18,720
and in fact a lot of them so currently

92
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,120
we have over 150 projects and and these

93
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,480
range

94
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,760
actually across all these different

95
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:27,518
layers

96
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:29,120
so um from trustworthy hardware

97
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:30,640
all the way up to to service and

98
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,799
applications from

99
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:35,040
data and artificial intelligence all the

100
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:35,440
way back to operating systems for mobile

101
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,120
and

102
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:40,799
and servers uh for middleware and

103
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,440
identity projects for software

104
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:46,159
engineering

105
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:47,680
fundamental protocol improvements i know

106
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:50,079
it's a crazy

107
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:53,200
idea to attempt to to summarize 150

108
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:55,439
projects in one go but i wanted to rush

109
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,640
through this uh because there are so

110
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:59,760
many awesome things and

111
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:02,159
and uh literally at an event like this

112
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:03,599
it would be impossible to to for each of

113
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,640
them to give a talk it's just so many

114
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:06,480
good stuff

115
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:08,159
so instead i'm just going to give you

116
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,640
some pointers to projects

117
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:11,599
and if you go to the the link of the

118
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,439
presentation

119
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:15,359
afterwards all of them are hyperlinks so

120
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:17,519
you can just easily click there

121
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,400
and the second thing is and you're

122
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,560
sitting here

123
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:22,239
meanwhile we also have a drink with the

124
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,560
project that we're currently funding and

125
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,759
all the other buddies which is upstairs

126
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,479
you're very welcome to join us

127
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:30,720
afterwards and the idea is that if you

128
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:32,560
have an idea that we aren't funding yet

129
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,840
maybe you should tell us because maybe

130
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,960
we want to fund it

131
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:39,679
we have a quite a a thorough vetting

132
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,880
but if you make it the benefits easily

133
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,240
are worth the

134
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,320
the effort because it's quite a

135
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:47,040
lightweight procedure so

136
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:49,120
and of course there were 25 talks over

137
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:52,800
25 talks during fostering this year

138
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:54,639
that are related to us uh so uh uh

139
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,000
again if you follow the link you'll find

140
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:57,600
a list of them and you can see

141
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,880
all the recording of all these wonderful

142
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,880
talks so

143
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:08,720
i'm just gonna snap and zap through the

144
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,600
these projects activity pub i guess many

145
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,639
people know

146
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:14,720
what it is so we we all think

147
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:15,759
uh that social media have become too

148
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,360
important

149
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,199
and too dominant that the companies

150
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,360
behind it so what do you do then you you

151
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:23,039
commoditize it you turn into protocols

152
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,919
and activity pub is

153
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:26,479
is the big candidate for that uh it was

154
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:30,080
it's a

155
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:31,599
w3c standard and so we're funding

156
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,120
actually quite a significant amount of

157
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:36,080
projects already so pixel fed

158
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:38,710
is uh well i guess for most people

159
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:41,440
something equivalent to uh

160
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:45,280
[Music]

161
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:46,880
instagram uh funk whale is a personal

162
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,320
music server that you connect

163
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,639
that connects to all of these other

164
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,639
applications spritely is distributed

165
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:55,280
social network xwiki

166
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:56,479
is one of the best known european wikis

167
00:05:55,280 --> 00:06:00,080
that we have

168
00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:02,800
and it'll allow to ingest and put out

169
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:04,240
a similar way so we are integrating way

170
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,639
more than what the social networks are

171
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,919
doing

172
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:07,680
we're trying to integrate everything and

173
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:09,840
that's the way we can overpower these

174
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:12,000
these huge companies by collaborating

175
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:15,280
making everything work together

176
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,280
uh opening adina is

177
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:19,198
i don't know if people know the ingadine

178
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:21,039
but it's it's a region

179
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,720
that is known for in switzerland that is

180
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:25,440
known for its small villages

181
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:27,120
as beautiful small villages and in order

182
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,759
for people to be able to connect to each

183
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,560
other in these

184
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:32,639
in this scattered around scenery you

185
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,880
actually need technology you can't say

186
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:36,560
let's meet up on meetup.com or let's go

187
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,080
to this and this website

188
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,400
or let's put everything on facebook that

189
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,880
won't work so uh they're they're trying

190
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,080
to add

191
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:47,360
basically semantic web features to uh

192
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:49,758
uh to to the whole ecosystem

193
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,720
and build infrastructures and networks

194
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:52,319
among these

195
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,080
different communities so from your local

196
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:56,160
music chapel to your

197
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,120
bed and breakfast and make everything

198
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,000
work together in

199
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,960
a consistent way this course i guess

200
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,479
many people

201
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,080
here will know it or use it because it's

202
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:08,159
one of the the best known

203
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:10,639
uh open source uh discussion platforms

204
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,280
that is going to get activity papays if

205
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:13,840
if that

206
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,880
becomes a verb at one point in time uh

207
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,719
librecast

208
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,319
is trying to get streaming video

209
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:21,039
streaming uh

210
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:21,360
in into this day and age without having

211
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:24,719
to

212
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:28,319
to to to go through a big company that

213
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:30,400
has a cdn uh and a big network to do it

214
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:32,160
but instead being able to do this from

215
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:35,359
well the laptop

216
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:38,639
uh here here in front of me

217
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:40,960
and then um what i really really like

218
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:42,479
is what build and collide is doing

219
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,080
building light is one of the largest

220
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:46,960
media collections in europe

221
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:48,080
so it's sound and vision uh image and

222
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,479
and sound

223
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:52,000
it's the it's a dutch media archive so

224
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:53,440
they have all of the archives

225
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,599
dating back to the very first sound

226
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:57,440
recordings uh uh

227
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:58,878
and they're going to put everything on

228
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:01,120
peertube

229
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:03,520
and they will make make all the content

230
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:06,080
searchable by enhancing the peers of pro

231
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:07,039
appeartube protocols to to allow for a

232
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,960
good search

233
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:11,199
so that you can actually put up millions

234
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,479
of hours of video on there and and see

235
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,639
if it scales and this is

236
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:16,400
this is not a smallest this is the

237
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:17,599
biggest media institute

238
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:20,080
in the netherlands and one of the

239
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:22,400
biggest in europe so

240
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:24,000
it's really awesome to for to see them

241
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,679
adopt the standard

242
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,240
and to to contribute to the open source

243
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:31,039
community around it

244
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,399
forcefedge a forged fed is is a new pro

245
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:33,838
uh project that wants to

246
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:35,919
do the same thing for software

247
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:37,919
repositories we're all

248
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:40,000
uh using different software repositories

249
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:41,120
these days so how do we make stuff work

250
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,240
together we can't

251
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,760
depend on everybody understanding or

252
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,519
building reputation

253
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:49,439
you cannot build reputation on a github

254
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:50,640
website because github steals your

255
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,200
reputation

256
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:55,040
if if that is a if you understand what i

257
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,120
mean if you if you have a project

258
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,719
and the first thing that people end up

259
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,200
with is not your

260
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,720
uh developer website but it is a website

261
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:06,240
from a company that

262
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:08,959
hosts your software just that but it

263
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:11,200
it instantly takes over your uh your

264
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:14,079
your search rankings because it's so big

265
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,519
so why not let people build reputation

266
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,080
with their with their messages with

267
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:18,000
their

268
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,360
with their uh documentation with

269
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,880
everything with their wikis

270
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,600
and build reputation on top of the

271
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:25,760
activity pub standard

272
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,200
and fetiverse space is a project that

273
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,279
that wants to

274
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:31,760
map out all of the vetivers so you can

275
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:35,279
understand where to go

276
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:36,240
now in the search space we have a lot of

277
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:37,439
projects because

278
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,040
one of the two topics that we're

279
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,480
focusing on is search discovery and

280
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:43,920
discoverability

281
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:46,959
so um search itself the circs project

282
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:48,319
uh is is a major and a wonderful open

283
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:51,359
source project

284
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,800
that actually is now being loaded with a

285
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,399
lot of different projects that build on

286
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:57,199
top of that meta search

287
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:58,880
uh capabilities so for instance they're

288
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,000
building a private search so you have a

289
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:03,040
search engine that you

290
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,480
can allow into your own email or your

291
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:07,519
own intranet

292
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:08,959
and not have to open it up to the to so

293
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:10,720
you have a single search bar

294
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:12,000
but you still find all the stuff that is

295
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:15,120
private to you

296
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:18,959
uh mailpile is a well-known mail server

297
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:21,279
uh client a hybrid client

298
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:23,040
and that'll actually integrate into that

299
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:26,320
private facility

300
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:29,920
uh next cloud will do the very same

301
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:32,079
web x-ray is a is a tool uh that you can

302
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,360
imagine you're surfing on the web and

303
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:35,839
you get uh

304
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,360
you you are going to a search engine you

305
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:41,360
you search for some term

306
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:43,519
and you get a nice stack of results

307
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,800
the search engine knows that there's

308
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:47,839
behind every link

309
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:48,560
there may be 25 maybe 100 maybe 600

310
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:50,240
trackers

311
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,839
that will track every click that you

312
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,800
have on that webpage

313
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:55,839
why is it not telling you well uh with

314
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,319
webxray

315
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:59,839
your your search engine will tell you

316
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,440
what it finds and you can actually say

317
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:02,959
don't show me that crazy company that

318
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,360
has trackers from

319
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:07,518
from the cayman islands or don't show me

320
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:09,920
that company that has bad behavior

321
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:11,600
or show me which other sites that i've

322
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:15,519
visited that this company

323
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:16,399
is tracking are i've already looked at

324
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:18,399
so that you can

325
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:19,440
get an awareness of of who is looking at

326
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,959
you on the internet

327
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,399
and that's the power of search it's it's

328
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:23,760
actually search engines are

329
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:25,200
recommendation engines

330
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:27,519
and there but they're also a knowledge

331
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:29,440
base that we need to tap into

332
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:31,120
in a far better way we we currently

333
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:34,320
don't do that but within the ngi

334
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:36,480
xero program we have a lot of uh uh

335
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,600
extra knowledge for instance on green

336
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,000
hosting

337
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:42,720
if a website is hosted in a in a data

338
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,560
center that is using carbon offsetting

339
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,839
then you can favor that website so

340
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,599
people will get

341
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:49,519
search results from ethical companies

342
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,519
before they get so there's 16 million

343
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:55,040
results for a given search term

344
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:56,880
i can afford to get number 44

345
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,160
instead of just number one to 10 on the

346
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:00,720
first page

347
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,680
if i say i like green hosted websites

348
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,240
then i can just

349
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,120
make people understand that i care about

350
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,760
it by

351
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:11,839
by actually favoring projects that that

352
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:11,839
do green hosting

353
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:16,000
oh i see i have three minutes left uh in

354
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,440
search there's a lot of new stuff so

355
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,800
ipfs

356
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:22,560
that so there's projects that we have

357
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,639
both under that protocol and on search

358
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:26,399
engines within that

359
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:28,160
there's browsers that are implementing

360
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:29,600
these these new standards inside the

361
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,680
browser itself so you don't need to

362
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,360
download a separate browser

363
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:35,040
and you get a programmable browser that

364
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:37,839
can manage all this new

365
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:39,360
information in a better way than a cust

366
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:43,040
than a normal regular

367
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:44,639
browser engine does um

368
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,560
i'll skip through the search stuff

369
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:48,160
because we also have some

370
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,839
some some really cool applications silk

371
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:52,480
server is a conference server that is

372
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:56,880
stripe protocol so it unites sip xmpp

373
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:59,600
and webrtc etasync is a protocol

374
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:00,480
for you to have synchronize all kinds of

375
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,920
things

376
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,920
with other people and with your other

377
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,560
devices without the server actually

378
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,880
knowing

379
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:08,719
so imagine like a really sensitive use

380
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:11,760
case i'm telling a server

381
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:13,519
or i'm telling my kid has a phone and

382
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:15,360
if he uses the phone i turn on this

383
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:16,639
feature that tracks his location because

384
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,800
i want to know where he is

385
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:20,560
but why does say a mobile operating

386
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,959
system creator notice that

387
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:24,239
no know where my kid is it's it's in

388
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:25,359
another country why should you be

389
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,880
tracking this well

390
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,560
there's ways to do this and the async

391
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:31,360
protocol is actually trying to

392
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:33,518
to to uh it's actually delivering this

393
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:36,079
capability of doing encrypted

394
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:37,040
data for everything that you need to

395
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:38,560
sync with others

396
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:40,480
and encrypting everything on the client

397
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:44,560
side cryptpad

398
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:46,839
is a is a a well-known project meanwhile

399
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:48,000
that delivers a collaborative editor for

400
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:49,600
documents

401
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,519
again with multiple people and again the

402
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,639
server is as stupid as hell it doesn't

403
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:54,639
know anything

404
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:56,079
that's a really attractive feature so it

405
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:56,720
allows you to host something for some

406
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:58,959
people

407
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:00,959
without you being able to look into

408
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:04,399
their private discussions

409
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:04,959
or host it for yourself the fear of palp

410
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:06,639
project

411
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:08,319
is another one of those crazy

412
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:09,360
fundamental things it's trying to make

413
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,120
protocol proofs

414
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:13,120
very simple for normal people to

415
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:15,600
understand and to actually create them

416
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:17,839
yourself because historically we've

417
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:20,720
pumped lots of protocol into the world

418
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:22,880
and yet we don't uh verify if the

419
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,920
protocols are good we just rely on human

420
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:27,279
engineers to uh

421
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:28,479
to to do that and the fair pal project

422
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:31,519
is able to uh

423
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:33,760
to to to make people design those

424
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:36,480
protocol booths themselves

425
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:38,240
let me quickly because we so we're on

426
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:40,880
mobile operating system we fund

427
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:42,959
uh hard open hardware projects and

428
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:45,040
there's a lot more i see i have 52

429
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:46,479
seconds so i'll rush a little bit

430
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:48,240
you can find all of these projects and

431
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:51,600
there's 150 of them and they're

432
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,000
uh they're all amazing uh you can go to

433
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,320
these

434
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,959
these urls in ellnot.net discovery and

435
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:58,959
ll.net

436
00:14:55,959 --> 00:14:59,920
pet um and we just want to thank the

437
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:02,638
european commission

438
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:04,000
who are fueling us to do this projects

439
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:05,920
um

440
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,600
and more importantly to urge you if you

441
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:09,120
have a good idea if it's not funded and

442
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,760
if it's anything remotely

443
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,480
uh interesting just approach us and see

444
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,240
it's it's it's

445
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,079
it's it's you can you can do an

446
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:18,480
application in half an hour and if you

447
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:20,079
uh uh if you don't get money you spend

448
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,639
half an hour and if you do get money

449
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:23,599
you can work on your passion for a for a

450
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:25,920
long uh

451
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:28,480
for a long time so okay that's that's

452
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,479
basically it

453
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:36,979
[Applause]

454
00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:41,279
thanks
