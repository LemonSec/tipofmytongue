gonna talk a little bit about

31
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,799
virtual reality a little bit about

32
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:20,320
augmented reality very little bit

33
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:23,680
also a little bit about ipfs so

34
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:25,039
without further ado uh who am i so the

35
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,280
ego slide

36
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,920
so uh i'm a student at uh rice

37
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:33,280
university uh i'm doing my phd there

38
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:36,079
and uh i have also worked with

39
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:38,000
mozilla as a intern and also a volunteer

40
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:40,960
i'm also a muslic speaker

41
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,079
i've also worked in ibm in little bit in

42
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:45,199
blockchain uh

43
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:47,199
part of my internships i

44
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,439
am also a google developer expert in web

45
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,520
technologies so that's uh kind of in a

46
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:54,880
nutshell who am i

47
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:58,798
and let's delve into what is

48
00:01:54,880 --> 00:02:01,360
ar vr or mr or internally xr

49
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,799
how many of you have at least tried one

50
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:06,159
form of these technologies

51
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:06,159
maybe in mobile or

52
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:11,920
awesome so as you can see this is

53
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:14,000
a pretty old picture that's even

54
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:16,480
sutherland uh that was what

55
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,680
he envisioned vr was that's like whole

56
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,000
room setup

57
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,599
and from there we have uh progress to

58
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,800
something like this

59
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:24,799
and this

60
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:33,518
so how can we create content in vr

61
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:35,599
how can we actually bring this in web

62
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:36,319
browser and how can you create content

63
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:38,160
in that

64
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:40,319
i'm going to briefly touch over how can

65
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:42,319
you create them and then we'll go

66
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:45,040
to understand how these can be

67
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:46,640
decentralized

68
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,720
so first the things we are going to talk

69
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,879
about is the frameworks

70
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,080
and how you can create them as i can see

71
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,959
most of you have at least

72
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,920
played with it uh so the two things i

73
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:59,040
will talk about is

74
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:00,559
a frame and uh how you can use a frame

75
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,840
to create wave vr

76
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,800
any of you have tried playing with wave

77
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:08,000
vr

78
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:09,200
or a frame okay so that gives me a

79
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,879
chance to actually show

80
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,879
how you can actually create vr content

81
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:17,680
so before you start what are the devices

82
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:20,879
right now that supports webvr

83
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,519
or webxr so these are the devices kind

84
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:24,159
of the

85
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:24,720
your into uh uh how where you consume

86
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:28,159
the

87
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:30,080
content so you see there's a like

88
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:32,079
range of device here from like three

89
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,799
dollar google cardboard which you can

90
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:36,000
also print

91
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:37,680
or build at home uh two very uh

92
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,720
expensive oculus quest

93
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:43,120
or htc vive and all these things

94
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,560
now the experience in all of them are

95
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,000
not exactly similar

96
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,080
so when you are building content you

97
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,200
also have to take into account where you

98
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:52,159
are building it or

99
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,159
who are your audience

100
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:59,120
now why web why not builds in something

101
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,879
like unity or like any gaming engine

102
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:04,000
which supports uh with

103
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:07,200
which supports vr so the primary

104
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,400
uh logic here is that web is open it's

105
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,560
instant

106
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,959
if i create something today right now in

107
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,959
the stage and i share a url with you

108
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:16,959
you can just tweet it or share with your

109
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,160
friends that okay see this is like a

110
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:20,720
nice cool example

111
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,639
and they can just open their mobile open

112
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,560
it in their browser and if it supports

113
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:26,960
and will see hit support or not

114
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,560
and they can immediately get into that

115
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,239
content they don't have to download

116
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,080
anything from any play store or app

117
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,800
store they don't have to wait for the

118
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:38,800
content to load

119
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:41,440
now where is it supported right now

120
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,080
so these are the devices where you can

121
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:45,440
play

122
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:48,719
with vr uh right now today so

123
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:51,040
firefox uh microsoft edge chromium uh

124
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:53,040
chrome for android uh oculus cameras

125
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,479
oculus browser samsung internet and

126
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,240
something is not here which is the

127
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:58,479
firefox reality browser

128
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,280
which right now is running here all

129
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:02,800
these support

130
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:03,599
uh we are out of the box now one of the

131
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:07,120
questions

132
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:09,280
is laguardia safari safari support right

133
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,479
now is not completely there we have a

134
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:13,520
mobile polyfill

135
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:15,840
which kind of makes uh it work

136
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:17,198
but the performance is not yet uh

137
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:20,080
comparable to the uh

138
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:21,840
native performance of these uh browsers

139
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,599
but apple is on board so

140
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:26,159
you you eventually will get support for

141
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,160
safari

142
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:37,199
now what is a frame how many of you have

143
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,199
at least heard and outlet with 3js

144
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:42,479
quite a few so 3gs is kind of like

145
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,960
graphics library where you can build

146
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:45,680
uh cool graphics demos or anything

147
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:49,758
animation

148
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,560
with that a frame is on built on 3gs so

149
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:52,639
it makes

150
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,840
building those things much easier for a

151
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:57,440
freer perspective

152
00:05:53,840 --> 00:06:00,239
how easy so

153
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:01,440
for our first hello world example in vr

154
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,759
uh these are like

155
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:05,120
all the lines hopefully you can read it

156
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:08,400
these are all the lines you need

157
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:10,800
to create a basic vr scene

158
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:13,198
let me show you what i mean by basic we

159
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,199
are seeing

160
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,720
so this is in codepen this is the exact

161
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,960
same

162
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,960
code

163
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:30,240
so what i have here is

164
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,440
something called ac and inside that i

165
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,759
have

166
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,719
four five elements which is a sphere

167
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:37,600
cube

168
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,000
cylinder and a sky element and this is

169
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,319
closed

170
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,520
there is nothing else here what it

171
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:45,360
produces for me

172
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:45,359
is something like this

173
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,800
so this is a vr scene right now running

174
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,719
from the browser

175
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,840
if i press on this and if my browser

176
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,880
supports

177
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:59,359
a vr scene then uh

178
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:02,080
it will just transport me to the device

179
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:04,160
so if i had oculus uh

180
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,919
go the portable one or the normal

181
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,240
circular quest i would have plugged into

182
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:08,719
my

183
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,599
uh laptop and i would have been into

184
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,599
this scene

185
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:12,800
to make this scene all i needed was this

186
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:15,520
five lines of code

187
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,840
now let's see what happens if i since

188
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,080
this

189
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,080
web

190
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:31,840
let's make it way bigger

191
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:45,840
okay where did it go

192
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:58,800
okay so it was so big it covered the

193
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,878
whole scene

194
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,800
so uh this is how you can build like

195
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:05,199
very simple vr scenes

196
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,879
uh there is a big uh uh like very good

197
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:08,639
documentation in a frame website i'm not

198
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:09,759
gonna go into that i just wanted to show

199
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:12,720
you how easy uh

200
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:15,120
it is to build vr scenes using a frame

201
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,960
now since this is a web page and this is

202
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,360
essentially a static web page

203
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:22,799
uh you can use uh your regular tools

204
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:24,960
like firefox jeff tools or chrome

205
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:28,000
inspect tools to actually inspect and

206
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,000
also edit these

207
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,120
right from the browser and it will work

208
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:35,679
so this is

209
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,679
essentially

210
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,399
the whole scene so this is the scene

211
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,640
this is a sphere

212
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:45,599
and if i change something here that just

213
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,598
like any web page

214
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,479
so that's how easy it is to create a vr

215
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:55,279
scene

216
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:57,040
now since this is essentially a website

217
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:58,720
this works very well with all of the web

218
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,000
technologies you have already been

219
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,720
playing around so

220
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,399
d3js which is react angular everything

221
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,880
works with it pretty well

222
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:09,120
uh that what that gives you that gives

223
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,720
you something to build

224
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,640
that gives you something where you can

225
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:15,839
have a d3 chart

226
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:16,880
load it in a frame uh get a json data

227
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:19,120
from somewhere

228
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:21,360
load it inside and just play around with

229
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:24,160
it i think i have time to at least show

230
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,360
how it looks like so there's a huge

231
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,600
community

232
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,959
in airframe you just just go to the blog

233
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,519
and you can see a lot of

234
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:32,719
cool interesting demos and it's very

235
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:35,519
good documented so

236
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,000
uh i'm not gonna go too deep into this

237
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:37,920
but

238
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,440
i'm gonna show you what you can do with

239
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:44,000
it so these are a few demos which

240
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:46,080
various communities and mozilla team and

241
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,279
also google has a website and google

242
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,839
experiments where

243
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:50,320
they have created so this is a painting

244
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:52,160
uh

245
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,760
application in html where you can just

246
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:56,880
paint something and

247
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:58,959
uh you can share the url and anybody can

248
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:01,439
actually go inside so if you have

249
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:04,319
play play google till brush uh this is

250
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:08,240
kind of the html version of that

251
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:10,800
you can use 360 degree videos or what

252
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:14,560
you can do with d3

253
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:16,479
now what i want to talk today mostly

254
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,119
about how you can use this technology

255
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,320
for social

256
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:23,360
interaction so this is a project called

257
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:25,279
mozilla hubs the social hub

258
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,560
what it gives you is that you have a

259
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:30,320
shared space

260
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:32,000
connected by webrtc where all of you can

261
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:35,200
go inside and talk with each other you

262
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:38,640
can literally use it for uh meetings

263
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:40,240
with that i'm gonna try a demo uh

264
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:47,839
can you try to open this in your mobile

265
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:47,839
right now

266
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,839
okay

267
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,720
so when you open it it should give you

268
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:35,040
something like

269
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,040
this

270
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:43,839
and if it loads

271
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:43,839
eventually

272
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:49,040
precisely for this reason i have

273
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,040
recorded demos

274
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:52,000
but why

275
00:11:54,880 --> 00:12:02,000
one last try it is loading

276
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,000
hopefully

277
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,160
well the beauty of this is that you

278
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:07,680
don't need me if more than one of you

279
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,680
have joined the room you literally

280
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:12,560
should be able to see others avatars

281
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:14,079
moving around in your mobiles

282
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:16,719
i could have shown it better if it

283
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:16,719
included here

284
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:23,519
meanwhile i'll go on

285
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:25,440
show what it should look like so this is

286
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:27,760
kind of a recorded demo so

287
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:29,279
this is how it should look like inside

288
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,920
the scene you can play around with the

289
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:32,399
ducks

290
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:34,639
or you can look around and see each

291
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:34,639
other

292
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:40,160
yeah essentially you can have the same

293
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:43,120
experience

294
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,120
in xr

295
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:48,399
you can have the same experience in xr

296
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:51,519
and

297
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:52,320
you can have these on you and move

298
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:56,320
around

299
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:58,880
and kind of see like this

300
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:01,839
now comes the other part of the talk the

301
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,839
decentralization

302
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:08,639
um before the recorded one i would try

303
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:13,680
to actually

304
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:13,680
do the demo so

305
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,959
okay

306
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,839
where did that go

307
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:54,079
i have no idea why i cannot reach the

308
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:56,880
top of the screen

309
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:56,880
which i need to

310
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:03,839
for those who never

311
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,839
let me try it once more

312
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,599
yes so what i am now trying to do is

313
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,560
that

314
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,959
can we have this same experience in ipfs

315
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:30,638
uh

316
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:33,119
how many of you have heard about ipfs

317
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:34,160
awesome awesome so what i'm trying to do

318
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,160
is that ipfs

319
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:37,199
is a interplanetary file system so

320
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:40,399
essentially

321
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:41,519
uh your data is not going uh not coming

322
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:43,760
from any server

323
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:45,279
it is coming from my machine and also

324
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:48,000
when i publish it in

325
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:48,480
ipfs and others see it it also comes

326
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,880
from

327
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,880
some of their machines in basic sense so

328
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:54,320
it is decentralized it's not coming from

329
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:57,519
any server

330
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:58,000
when i publish any static file so when i

331
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:00,560
was showing

332
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,440
you the demo for hubs it is essentially

333
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:04,239
an html

334
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,440
uh the client side it's a node.js uh

335
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:07,519
application

336
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,720
and it's connecting to each other using

337
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:11,920
webrtc

338
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:13,920
so now i have a very simple demo uh

339
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:16,639
using a frame shared component

340
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:17,839
that is using the same technology webrtc

341
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:21,279
to connect to a

342
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:24,000
vr scenes and can we use this web rtc

343
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:26,240
in ipfs so this is a demo this is

344
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:30,480
running inside ipfs

345
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:32,560
as you can see i have the code

346
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,759
you will see the code at the end of the

347
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:37,758
talk so

348
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:41,839
can we use this and communicate

349
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:41,839
so what i am doing is that

350
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:46,240
this and this is gonna try to

351
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:51,600
communicate with

352
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:51,600
each other using webrtc from ipfs

353
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:57,040
if it fails i can have the recording

354
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:01,120
yes it did not fail

355
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,639
now can you see it

356
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:11,680
so i sent something and

357
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:14,820
here i have the hello world

358
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,819
[Music]

359
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:23,839
and if i say something here

360
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:31,120
so as you can see we can communicate

361
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:34,399
with two ipfs

362
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:37,600
static sites in uh using webrtc

363
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:38,959
and uh can we integrate this with

364
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:42,560
something in a frame

365
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:46,319
and that has to be a static side so

366
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:51,839
what i essentially will try to do

367
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:51,839
is use

368
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:57,439
a fm component called a fm shared

369
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:01,599
component

370
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:03,519
so what this component

371
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:06,319
gives you like immediately out of the

372
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:08,559
box is something like

373
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:08,559
this

374
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:17,280
so this is a share though so this whole

375
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:19,039
component when you just add it and

376
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,959
initialize it it gives you a chatting

377
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:23,359
room using webrtc

378
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:26,400
where you can if you move to other room

379
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:28,240
and somebody connects with this

380
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,320
url you should be able to communicate

381
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:32,720
with us using voice

382
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:34,399
this is running in glitch and it doesn't

383
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:37,840
have any surface component

384
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:41,360
and the code

385
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:44,480
is essentially so the only thing you

386
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:49,600
need the minimal setup is this template

387
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:52,799
and the script so which essentially is

388
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:56,559
this so this is the room setup and

389
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:59,360
these are all building up the

390
00:17:56,559 --> 00:18:00,000
models inside the scene and then if you

391
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:02,959
use it

392
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,600
uh in published in ipfs and use uh what

393
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,240
i showed

394
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:07,840
you can actually make it using ips uh

395
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,840
and it is decentralized

396
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:15,840
and it's not coming from any server like

397
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:15,840
right now it's coming from glitch

398
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:30,880
also what you can do

399
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,640
so this was the recorded demo uh also

400
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,400
the some other things you can do is that

401
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,160
since uh if you don't have a server

402
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:39,120
component and you are just

403
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:39,919
creating static files for example like

404
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:42,639
this

405
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:43,760
so this is the painting in real world uh

406
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:46,720
kind of the

407
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:47,440
a-frame sorry the a-painter you have xr

408
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,080
painter

409
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:51,679
uh you can go to the muslin hacks uh

410
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,159
website and you have very good write-up

411
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:54,640
how

412
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:56,000
you can use this so you can also publish

413
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:59,840
publish these in

414
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,840
any ipfs site and it will work

415
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:07,760
so web is the ideal platform for making

416
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,480
air and vr component and today i'm gonna

417
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,240
argue that

418
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:12,960
not only web you can actually use these

419
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:16,480
components in a decentralized way

420
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:17,760
so if you want to learn more about these

421
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,520
and all the resources

422
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:21,039
this is the slide you should take

423
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:23,600
picture of

424
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:25,600
all the codes i have shown are in github

425
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:28,480
and this slide is also in github

426
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:29,360
and everything you can try it at your

427
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:32,559
home

428
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:34,080
if you have any queries or questions or

429
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:37,280
anything later to talk about

430
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:38,240
you can bring me in twitter or in my

431
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:40,240
email address

432
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:42,240
the stock will also be the talk is

433
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,760
available right now in this link that is

434
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:46,240
essentially a github page

435
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:47,679
and thanks to everyone in mozilla

436
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:50,480
reality

437
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:52,000
team and a lot of other people whose

438
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:54,640
demos i have used for

439
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,840
this uh talk today thank you and if you

440
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:58,960
have any question

441
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:59,840
reach out to me and do come to the demos

442
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,360
this is awesome

443
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:03,039
demo you will be able to see which i

444
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:07,199
cannot cover in 25 minutes

445
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:10,960
thank you

446
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:12,880
so um you will be able to chat with the

447
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,600
ramen bar right after but if you already

448
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,039
have questions

449
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:17,360
i know you have questions because it's

450
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:19,120
kind of based on how many hands were

451
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,799
raised and not raised on trying vr and

452
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:23,918
3gs you do have questions

453
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:24,799
so who is the first and a question ends

454
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:28,159
with a question mark

455
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:29,679
not an opinion that's we're after so

456
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:35,840
because i'll have silly questions if you

457
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:35,840
don't have

458
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:46,158
uh thank you for the presentation um

459
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:54,799
how will the um the speed

460
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:54,799
um of um

461
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:00,879
how will the performance be um down the

462
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:03,360
line with

463
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:05,440
especially with um web browsers now

464
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:08,959
taking more and more ram

465
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:12,240
um how do you see that scale with

466
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:15,280
um yeah

467
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:17,280
ar and uh yeah augmented

468
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:18,320
so the question is uh how is the

469
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:20,720
performance and

470
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:22,320
uh with uh large components and

471
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,880
everything running in mobile browser or

472
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,480
maybe

473
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,320
desktop browser uh like what are the

474
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,200
performance caveats i think that's the

475
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:30,240
question

476
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:31,440
uh so right now uh if you are running it

477
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,679
in text shop

478
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:35,120
uh the only performance caveat is you

479
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:38,080
need a good machine to run

480
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:39,120
it in the oculus browser uh so sorry the

481
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:41,678
oculus quest

482
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:43,439
so the requirement is from graphics

483
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:45,840
perspective not that much into

484
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,640
uh the browser perspective right now we

485
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:49,918
have reached a

486
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:51,600
uh like a position where you can run it

487
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:54,400
comfortably in mobile phones

488
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:55,760
so this the demo i showed which is

489
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,480
essentially this one

490
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:58,879
uh this is running in a like pixel xl uh

491
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,720
that

492
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:02,720
is a pixel phone like a three years old

493
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,400
phone and it's running in a browser

494
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,840
and in an experimental browser that

495
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,679
crashes all the time

496
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:09,840
but even then you can see it's pretty

497
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:12,559
fluid so you can just see it

498
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:13,760
and it works pretty well so uh you can

499
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:16,799
definitely build uh

500
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:19,520
on excel performance on that and uh

501
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:20,720
vr performance you can like it's already

502
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:24,639
people are building industry

503
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:28,000
applications on that thank you

504
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:29,600
next question uh

505
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,280
quick quick remark while you're thinking

506
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,799
about the next question a lot of the

507
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:35,520
performance is actually

508
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:36,320
not really executing in the browser but

509
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,400
how

510
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:40,399
dedicated software like unity and unreal

511
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:43,120
are packaging the assets for example

512
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,320
a lot of it like in terms of optimizing

513
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:46,559
texture

514
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:48,158
mipmaps all this is done before it's

515
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:50,320
actually shipped to the browser so don't

516
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:53,440
compare directly let's say unity app

517
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:55,120
to a webxr app and think it's

518
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,880
not as performant because there is a lot

519
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:59,918
of pre-processing basically happening

520
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:01,440
up front so next question i don't see

521
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:09,840
any hand

522
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:09,840
maybe i'm just tired

523
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:19,039
um do you think uh the web will migrate

524
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:20,559
uh i mean we'll have a future with the

525
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:23,679
vr will be

526
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:25,678
the regular platform for the whip uh

527
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:27,280
uh so the question is uh do i think the

528
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:29,760
web will be like a good fit for

529
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:31,280
this scenario will it be like regular uh

530
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,879
will can it be used in regular uh

531
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:36,000
performance uh things

532
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:40,640
i think it is like great platform and

533
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,640
let me go back and show why

534
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:46,399
so this is like a real example

535
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:48,080
uh this is a webpage where you can just

536
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:51,360
load a 360 degree video

537
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:53,439
inside the page and imagine uh um

538
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:55,120
going to a bbc's page or amnesty

539
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:57,120
international and you hear about the

540
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:59,279
bombing or hear about something

541
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:01,439
uh in your desktop browser or maybe

542
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:02,799
mobile you just click on the link and if

543
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:05,520
you have a browser you just

544
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:07,679
get into immersive experience so that's

545
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:09,679
exactly what google has been um

546
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:10,720
experimenting with in the search where

547
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:13,760
you search

548
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:15,360
by some name of animal maybe panda and

549
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:17,039
it will give you an option that

550
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:19,120
you can get the panda right now in the

551
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:20,799
room from mobile browser and

552
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:22,719
like see okay this is the animal i'm

553
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:25,360
searching for so i think this is like

554
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,360
great example

555
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:29,360
okay last question and after that we'll

556
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:31,919
have to defrag

557
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:33,360
because you guys are not together and we

558
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:35,760
have a lot of people waiting so last

559
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,760
question

560
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:42,320
otherwise it would be after but it's

561
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:44,840
probably a nice question that anybody

562
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:47,840
else want to hear

563
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:47,840
so
