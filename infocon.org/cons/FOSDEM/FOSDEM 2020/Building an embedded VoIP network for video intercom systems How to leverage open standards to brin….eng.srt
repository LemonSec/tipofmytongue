1
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:12,320
good morning everybody

2
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:16,079
my name is uh jean-marie

3
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:18,480
i'm a software engineer since 1999 and

4
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:19,839
i'm mainly involved in uh in the lean

5
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:24,080
phone project

6
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:26,560
since 2010 so in a few words um the

7
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:30,479
lymphoma project is a voiceover ip

8
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:33,680
the phone developed for linux in

9
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,520
in very early 2000s so what i'm going to

10
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,600
talking about is how to use the

11
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,640
voiceover ip technology

12
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:44,000
to build uh

13
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:47,120
an intercom system for for for the

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,719
entry okay

15
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:53,599
so the the presentation will first

16
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:55,600
start to to introduce the use case so

17
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:59,520
what it is about when you

18
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:02,399
want to to build this kind of system

19
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,760
what is the voiceover technology that we

20
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:07,280
suggest to use

21
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:10,880
and how to build a very simple

22
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:14,400
voiceover network using a raspberry pi

23
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:15,439
as an example and with the lymphoma

24
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,960
software

25
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:22,158
and what would be the

26
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:25,199
the next things okay so

27
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:28,159
the simple use case is it's like big so

28
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,040
you have an intercom a doorbell in front

29
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:32,159
of your building

30
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:35,600
and you want to someone to to open

31
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:38,880
um to open the door

32
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:42,000
so in the past

33
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:43,439
so the very simple solution is to have a

34
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,280
camera in

35
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:50,960
in the front of the building and to use

36
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:55,840
a simple quax cable to to link

37
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:55,839
the camera to to the home screen

38
00:01:56,079 --> 00:02:01,600
okay so it's pretty cool but now if you

39
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:04,798
want to have multiple display at

40
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:08,478
atom like the home screen but also

41
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:10,879
why not a mobile device or a pc so

42
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:13,200
we start to be in the multi display use

43
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:13,200
case

44
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:19,760
okay so same thing i have the cracks but

45
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,400
what if i want to to bring the video to

46
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,399
my

47
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:26,319
mobile device for instance so it's

48
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,319
become much more complex

49
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:32,239
and what we can also imagine that

50
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,599
the same kind of use case so you want

51
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:36,800
the video to be displayed

52
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:39,280
at home but also

53
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,319
in the street on your mobile device if

54
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,680
you want to know

55
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:47,119
if something is a ring is happening

56
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,120
in front of your home

57
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,679
so the good thing is that we can

58
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,120
leverage on digital infrastructure to do

59
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:56,879
this kind of thing

60
00:02:53,120 --> 00:03:00,000
so no no more analytic

61
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:04,480
audio or video but we can use high p

62
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,760
to carry audio and video packets from

63
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:08,720
the

64
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,040
the door entry panel to the home screen

65
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,400
or

66
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:16,319
even a mobile device or even a

67
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,319
mobile device connected to the public

68
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:21,760
internet

69
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:25,760
and when it's about ip

70
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:28,480
voiceover ip is a good idea

71
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,359
and especially two protocols which are

72
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,879
sip

73
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:35,760
sip and rtp for real-time

74
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,760
transport protocol

75
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:45,040
so voiceover technology that

76
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:48,560
i'm going to to use for this

77
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:49,679
presentation are based on two main ietf

78
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,159
standards

79
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,680
the first one is sip session initiation

80
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:55,920
protocol

81
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:58,480
and the second one is real time

82
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,480
transport

83
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,840
product

84
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:09,760
so ship in a few words it's a

85
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:12,840
text-based protocol there is inspired

86
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:16,000
from http standardized in

87
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:19,600
2000 there are two main components

88
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:23,600
in a sip network the sip user agent and

89
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:26,840
c proxy which uh which are about

90
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:29,840
writing messages between different

91
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,840
clients

92
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:38,479
and rtp in short basically

93
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:41,120
the idea is to send

94
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:41,758
audio and video in a package packet eyes

95
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,320
way over

96
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:44,320
internet

97
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:53,919
okay so now we want to use ip

98
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:55,840
we will use steep and rtp so what we

99
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:59,280
need

100
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:59,919
a sip user agent located in a down tree

101
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:05,758
camera

102
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:05,758
and a cpuser agent in the home screen

103
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:14,880
for the software for the hardware

104
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:17,359
uh at the door entry camera level

105
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,080
what we need is to be able to capture

106
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,520
audio

107
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:25,440
video and for the home screen we need

108
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:27,359
just to be able to display video and

109
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,479
capture the audio because most of the

110
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:32,160
time there is no screen

111
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:32,159
in the front door

112
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:41,919
so for the software what we need is a

113
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:42,639
what we propose is to use info which is

114
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:46,639
a sip

115
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:49,360
user agent with rtp capabilities

116
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:53,199
and for the home screen so we can do

117
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:56,560
exactly the same

118
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:59,759
okay so now

119
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:02,960
we have the hardware can be

120
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:06,479
a raspberry pi or any uh any uh

121
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:10,239
small hardware running arm or any other

122
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:13,599
processor a display

123
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:16,960
a cable

124
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:19,440
and on the software base we can use

125
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:21,120
the raspbian distribution of the

126
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:25,120
raspberry pi with linux

127
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:25,120
with lynn phone on both parties

128
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,960
okay so at the door on three camera

129
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:34,719
level

130
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:37,840
what we can use his

131
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:40,720
command line is lynphone demon daemon

132
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:41,359
which is a command line interface for

133
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:45,600
being

134
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:48,720
able to place or receive call with

135
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:51,759
early media feature i'm going to explain

136
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:55,039
what it is about so

137
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:58,960
early media is a specific

138
00:06:55,039 --> 00:07:02,880
way of initiating course

139
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:04,880
for regular call you

140
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,319
wait for the call to be established

141
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,960
before

142
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:10,080
exchanging media between the two end

143
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:13,520
points

144
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:16,000
in the case of early media the idea is

145
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:19,120
to be able to send the video

146
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:22,880
before answering the call because

147
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:24,639
when someone is in front of the door you

148
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,800
want to be able to see

149
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:28,160
this video it's a kind of preview but

150
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:32,800
not

151
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:32,800
necessarily accepting the call

152
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,560
so linfon demon it's an open source a

153
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:43,599
project derivative from lynn phone

154
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,599
it's available on

155
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:48,879
on our public git repository and

156
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,639
also something interesting for the

157
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:54,000
embedded case

158
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:57,120
we provide some yocto receipt to um

159
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:00,639
to integrate uh informed demand

160
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,639
within the octo distribution

161
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:10,400
okay so how it will work

162
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:13,039
just a button connected to the gpio

163
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:14,000
i just start in front demand uh in the

164
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:17,199
background

165
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,919
uh with a unix pipe and

166
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:21,759
with a couple of lines of python it's

167
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:26,080
pretty easy to

168
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:29,800
handle the on the the button

169
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:32,000
and just to open the socket

170
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:33,680
communicating with the lynn from daemon

171
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:40,000
and to

172
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:43,120
initiate a call that's it

173
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,360
on the display on the display side

174
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,640
it's almost the same you can just start

175
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,600
inform demand

176
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:52,399
in auto answer mode and it will

177
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:55,680
automatically display the

178
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:59,040
the video

179
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,839
so it's for the very simple use case so

180
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,839
now

181
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:03,040
if you want something a little bit more

182
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:04,959
complex

183
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,640
you want to be able to distribute the

184
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:09,279
video not only

185
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:11,199
to the on screen but 2d on screen and to

186
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:15,279
another equipment which can

187
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:18,320
which can be for instance to

188
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:18,320
a mobile application

189
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,880
you need to add another equipment in the

190
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:26,800
sip world which is the c

191
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:29,519
proxy the

192
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,479
the the purpose of the sip proxy will be

193
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:33,680
to wrap

194
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:35,839
the cord on both the cpu

195
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:37,199
the agent which is in the home screen

196
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:41,200
and

197
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:43,839
on another

198
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:47,040
user agent which can be a mobile

199
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:47,040
application for instance

200
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:51,600
so now we we suggest to use another

201
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,800
equipment which is

202
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:57,519
uh which is called flexicip uh c

203
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:59,839
proxy as i said in in the beginning it's

204
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:03,040
the matter of fact proxies to rot

205
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:05,200
the the cars and uh

206
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:07,199
with a special feature which is the

207
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,279
early media called because

208
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,040
as i said uh at the beginning of the

209
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:14,079
presentation what we would like

210
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:15,519
is to have the video uh coming from the

211
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:19,120
doran 3 system

212
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:22,720
to the home screen or to the

213
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:23,519
mobile application before establishment

214
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:27,600
of the call

215
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:31,040
so we need a c proxy which is able to

216
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:32,000
to duplicate the audio stream in order

217
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:35,680
to be displayed

218
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,680
on both devices

219
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:41,599
it's the it's what is called your ali

220
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,720
media

221
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,839
call working standing video previous pk

222
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:49,200
from the co-initiator

223
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:49,200
to all-ringing devices

224
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:57,440
okay so flexicip it's a simple

225
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:59,279
process running on linux with a very

226
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,720
small configuration file so

227
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:03,360
just a couple of sections to

228
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:08,000
authenticate

229
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:11,040
i need to to set the domain of my

230
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:14,320
my house and a smaller

231
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:15,760
configuration file with the

232
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:19,360
with the password in order to

233
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:19,360
authenticate the the user

234
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,600
if we want to go in deep into the c

235
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,800
protocol

236
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,200
so i have the smartphone and app which

237
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,800
was

238
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:37,839
registered to the on screen the 2d

239
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:39,920
on screen c proxy the on screen panel

240
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:42,880
which was resistor as well

241
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:43,360
and when the dual entry camera want to

242
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:46,560
invite

243
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:47,440
call the invite goes to the proxy which

244
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,439
fork

245
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:52,240
the invite to both the smartphone

246
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:55,360
application and to the home screen

247
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:56,079
and the rtp with the video can be

248
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:00,320
displayed

249
00:11:56,079 --> 00:12:00,319
on both device at the same time

250
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:07,839
okay so now if we go

251
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:09,199
a little bit in deep in in the

252
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:12,079
complexity

253
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:13,839
i want the the video of my daughter

254
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:17,439
entry system to be seen

255
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:19,600
on my own but also if i'm outside

256
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,760
it would be cool if i could be able to

257
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:24,560
see who is

258
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:27,279
pressing the button in front of my house

259
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:30,319
so now what we need is two cascade

260
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:33,360
two c proxy one at home and

261
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:36,160
another which can be located anywhere

262
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,160
on internet

263
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,719
so we can do we can do it with a flexi

264
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:45,200
sip

265
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:48,720
the same way so we had

266
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:53,279
um a small configuration

267
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:56,399
file which explain which which state

268
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:59,040
where to fork the call uh

269
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:59,839
on the public internet so as you can see

270
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:03,439
we have um

271
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:04,480
a first sip address which is everyone at

272
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:07,600
my house

273
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:11,200
which is forked to home screen and to

274
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:13,519
bob at sib.tinfont.org which is

275
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:16,000
an ip address available from the public

276
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:16,000
internet

277
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:25,519
okay so more or less it's the same

278
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:28,639
just the end is different the c proxy

279
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:29,839
from the from the home screen is

280
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:32,959
forwarding

281
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:36,320
um the invite to the public internet

282
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:39,439
proxy and at the end the video is

283
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:42,480
can be seen on the local network

284
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:45,360
and on the device connected to the

285
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,360
public internet

286
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:52,020
security consideration so

287
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:55,120
it's very sensitive data which is

288
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:58,079
[Music]

289
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:59,519
coming from from your apartment and from

290
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:02,719
the doorbell so

291
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:04,399
make sure to use cls and srtp

292
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,760
everywhere to to secure the

293
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:09,760
communication

294
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:13,439
and also if you put some password

295
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:15,680
in the in the

296
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,959
in the local network it's it's still

297
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:21,120
better to

298
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:21,119
to hash the password

299
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,760
okay so it was for the further the

300
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:28,839
presentation of

301
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:34,160
of the replay network for the

302
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:34,160
video intercon system what next

303
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,800
we we can also imagine to do the

304
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:42,320
opposite

305
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:45,199
i mean to call the door entry

306
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,480
panel from a smartphone it's also

307
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:49,599
something which can be

308
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:54,079
doable it's also

309
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:58,800
possible to to add action to the

310
00:14:54,079 --> 00:15:00,560
to the to the

311
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:02,399
to the system i mean if you want to be

312
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:06,800
able to open the door

313
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:09,839
you can as an example use dtmf to

314
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:13,199
uh to pilot some

315
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:17,680
some switch at the door entry panel

316
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:21,040
level an interesting thing that

317
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:24,959
that you can also use is mdns

318
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:27,599
to able to automatically discover

319
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:29,359
the door entry panel or the home screen

320
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:33,120
without having to

321
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:33,120
configure ip addresses

322
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,560
another interesting topic that that we

323
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:43,040
could discuss is

324
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:46,479
how to in to to use push notification

325
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:49,040
to be able to wake up

326
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,680
mobile application when someone is

327
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:54,160
pressing

328
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:55,839
the home entry button

329
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:57,759
this is something which also is

330
00:15:55,839 --> 00:16:02,399
available from

331
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:02,399
from the flex sip c proxy

332
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:07,440
another interesting point is

333
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:09,758
interworking with existing

334
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:11,120
door entry camera i'm pretty sure that

335
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:14,720
on your building

336
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:17,279
uh there is a door on two panels

337
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,480
and what we what we experience is that

338
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:22,079
most of them

339
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:24,880
are using sip as as the

340
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:25,758
the protocol to to bring the audio and

341
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:29,600
video from

342
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:32,320
the dorm tree panel to an equipment

343
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,959
in the house so if you want to be able

344
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:37,519
to

345
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:40,079
to use existing equipment and just to

346
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:42,240
to to change the display it's something

347
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:46,479
which is uh which is possible

348
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:46,480
as they followed the ship standard

349
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:53,920
and the last thing is uh

350
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:55,519
in my presentation i introduced lynphone

351
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:58,399
demand which is a common line

352
00:16:55,519 --> 00:17:00,160
tool but if you want to have deep deep

353
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:02,240
control of the application

354
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:04,079
you can use the library version of

355
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,120
lynphone demand to do the same it's

356
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:08,399
available

357
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:13,839
on cc plus plus and on many

358
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:13,839
other languages even on python

359
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:22,799
okay thank you i think i'm

360
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:22,799
three minutes ahead thank you

361
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,840
yes

362
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,840
come on

363
00:17:48,480 --> 00:18:02,799
okay any questions ah yes okay

364
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,240
thank you thank you for the presentation

365
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:06,400
so is that a

366
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:08,080
commercial project without your personal

367
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:11,840
hobby project

368
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:15,439
ah in fact there is no

369
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:18,799
real project for this kind of uh of

370
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,799
application yet

371
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,080
i would say that i'm part of the lynfont

372
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,879
team

373
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:26,000
and there is a company backing the the

374
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:29,120
lynfont project

375
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:33,200
which proposed this kind of uh

376
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:36,320
of service but there is no

377
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:37,200
currently there is no project dedicated

378
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:40,559
to

379
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:43,840
uh this kind of application it's more

380
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:47,360
it's more uh a usage of

381
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:50,639
linfo and plexiship for this kind of

382
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:54,559
uh application than a rail project

383
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:56,880
dedicated to um to the entry system

384
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:57,918
was it your question uh the question was

385
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,520
really like

386
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:01,120
you you're talking about having your

387
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:04,559
proxy and then

388
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:07,039
sip on on the stationary

389
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:07,918
you know tablet to display the incoming

390
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:11,039
hole so

391
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:15,280
would you put proxy on the same uh

392
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:18,320
tablet as oh the the proxy which is

393
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:21,200
in the home yeah yes uh

394
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:22,399
the idea is to to use the same hardware

395
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:25,600
for

396
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:29,120
both the home screen and the

397
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:32,480
the c proxy okay so

398
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:35,520
let's say you're streaming the video

399
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:38,080
to proxy and then it goes to the tablet

400
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:41,120
itself and mobile phone

401
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:44,000
how do you deal with video decoding

402
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:44,799
is that hardware supported on both

403
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,320
phones

404
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:50,720
and tablet or can proxy do recording or

405
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:52,879
how do you do this video decoding

406
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:54,000
video decoding is done on software is it

407
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:57,520
hardware

408
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:00,799
decoding uh the proxy is not

409
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:04,158
decoding the video at all it's a it's uh

410
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:06,480
the same rtp stream which is to

411
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:07,520
both the home screen and to the mobile

412
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,440
application

413
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:11,440
and the mobile application is supposed

414
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:14,880
to be able to decode either

415
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:17,280
h264 or vp8 depending on the

416
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,000
on the protocol which is used most of

417
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:20,639
the time

418
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,799
it's h264 because it's possible to

419
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:26,320
leverage on the hardware

420
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:29,280
implementation of this kind of of codec

421
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:31,360
which is available either on raspberry

422
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:34,559
pi or on many other

423
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:37,199
embedded hardware okay cool thank you

424
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:37,200
you're welcome

425
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:53,120
so how this how is a lymphoma

426
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:58,240
compared to other uh voip

427
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:58,239
soft softwares like zebo and elastics

428
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:03,840
the question is is there any

429
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:12,720
i would say that uh we have no

430
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:15,440
experience in this kind of scenario

431
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:17,280
with uh xevo but lymphoid works with

432
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:20,480
gazebo

433
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:21,120
for regular phone calls so as xivo is

434
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,360
based on

435
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:24,239
asterix and asterix is following the sim

436
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:27,600
protocol

437
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:28,799
i don't see any any kind of issue to use

438
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:31,840
the xevo

439
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:31,840
with this kind of

440
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:37,280
deployment of lynn phone within the

441
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:45,840
doorbell

442
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,579
[Music]

443
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:53,919
on the type of hardware that you've been

444
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:55,039
talking about here what sort of latency

445
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:57,440
do you get between

446
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:58,080
somebody actually pressing the doorbell

447
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:00,799
and

448
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:01,600
a mobile phone getting an image and then

449
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:03,440
what's the

450
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,799
quality of communication between the two

451
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,480
ends like in terms of

452
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:08,879
delay between one speaking and the other

453
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:12,559
hearing oh

454
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:14,720
if you are i would say it's a matter of

455
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:15,600
network quality so if the quality is

456
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:18,799
good

457
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:24,320
uh if if it's a wire cable if it's

458
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:27,600
cable where there is almost no delay

459
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:30,720
you have the encoded time at the

460
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:34,240
doorbell the doorbell level

461
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:37,440
but if it's hardware encoding uh

462
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,440
it's it's cued and

463
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:42,320
it's a ping time or more or less there

464
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:46,080
is no i would say

465
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:49,120
50 50 millisecond 100 at

466
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:51,678
maximum but not not more on the local

467
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:52,320
if you are speaking about the the public

468
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:55,360
internet

469
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:59,120
it's a little bit more complex but

470
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:59,120
on local network there is no

471
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:09,840
no problematic latency

472
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:21,600
thank you for the presentation my

473
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:23,760
question is i use a

474
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,959
voice over ip product like a service

475
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:27,679
from a service provider

476
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:28,799
for a few years ago and i have it always

477
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:31,039
connected in my

478
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:33,280
zoipper or something have you considered

479
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:35,679
giving the doorbell

480
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:37,520
for example a connectivity directly to

481
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:38,559
the internet or through some proxy with

482
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:41,120
some general

483
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:42,240
voice over ip telephone number so that i

484
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:44,639
will only set

485
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:46,480
the telephone numbers of me and my

486
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:49,039
family members and it will

487
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:50,000
act as a standard voice over ip video

488
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:53,919
call in their

489
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:56,000
mobile clients why not why not i i don't

490
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:59,120
see any uh

491
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:02,159
issue with that as as i said

492
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:05,678
it's a standard sip so if

493
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:07,120
if you if your network provider or your

494
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:09,919
sip network provider

495
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:11,439
follow the standard you can you can

496
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:14,559
simply

497
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:14,960
configure the the zip address that you

498
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:18,399
have

499
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:21,600
and directly connect the

500
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:23,279
doorbell to um to your public uh

501
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:25,199
so if the provider keeps all the

502
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:26,559
standards and supports dtmf

503
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:33,840
everything would be possible using the

504
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:33,840
standard client okay thank you

505
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:47,840
okay this has all the time we have now

506
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:47,840
so thank you very much

507
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:52,000
you
