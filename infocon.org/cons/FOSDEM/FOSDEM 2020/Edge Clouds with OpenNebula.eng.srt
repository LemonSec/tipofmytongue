1
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:08,800
hello uh

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,760
welcome everybody my name is vlasty

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:13,120
manholer i

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:15,599
work for the open ebola systems and

5
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:17,680
right now we will speak a little about

6
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:18,240
the edge clouds and how we understand

7
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,039
the uh

8
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,359
uh the edge clouds uh in context with

9
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:24,080
the

10
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:24,640
with the opennebra uh i have to say that

11
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,038
i won't do

12
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:29,039
any any like a real demo but i'm

13
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:32,399
starting just uh just to

14
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:33,600
show uh something and i will describe it

15
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:37,040
a little later so

16
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,640
just for for the further reference so uh

17
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,079
about the edge cloud it's uh it's

18
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,399
necessary to say that

19
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,719
uh our work our current work and our

20
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:47,760
future works

21
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:50,960
receives the funding from the european

22
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:55,120
eu union from from

23
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:57,520
from the horizon 2020 research program

24
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,399
this talk is divided into mainly three

25
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,399
parts

26
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:02,079
in general what is open ebola if you

27
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:04,320
don't know uh then

28
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:05,680
how we understand the edge clouds and

29
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:09,039
then what do we do

30
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:11,040
or uh what approach we uh or what tools

31
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,479
we provide to build the edge clouds in

32
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,600
the open envelope

33
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:16,720
so just a quick poll who knows what is

34
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:22,479
open emblem

35
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:22,479
just could and who uses open emblem

36
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:28,320
great so just to just to summarize

37
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:30,158
uh openable is a framework to build

38
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,798
infrastructure as a service cloud

39
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:33,600
mainly we focus on the private cloud uh

40
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,079
we talk about

41
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,280
virtual machines powered by kvm or

42
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:40,559
vcenter

43
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:42,079
and the system containers powered by lxd

44
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,759
we support various cloud deployment

45
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:46,079
architectures but

46
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:46,880
mainly what we focus is on is

47
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:50,158
on-premises

48
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:52,240
private cloud usually it's appreciate

49
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,280
openable is appreciated for being a

50
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,920
light and simple

51
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,880
extensible easily upgradable when

52
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,799
compared to

53
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:03,439
other other other systems it supports

54
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:05,840
various popular linux distributions

55
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:08,318
santos rail ubuntu debian and so on

56
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:10,399
and it's a fully open source on the

57
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:15,440
apache license

58
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:15,440
and it's with us for some time already

59
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,599
this is how it looks like from the

60
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,840
perspective of the graphical

61
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:23,040
control interface a list of virtual

62
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,720
machines at

63
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,560
the top a list of buttons you can

64
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:30,800
control reboot and

65
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,800
power of destroy and this kind of stuff

66
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:37,760
if you want to like see all the features

67
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,440
there is a discover page which lists

68
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:41,359
them uh

69
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:43,120
if you want to try the open envelope

70
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:46,319
there's a really cool tool

71
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,879
uh written in a in a shell called mini

72
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:49,359
one

73
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:50,160
which simply configures all the open

74
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,160
envelope

75
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:54,879
like a front-end part and the hypervisor

76
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:57,280
part on a single selected

77
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:58,959
node simply creates some some kind of

78
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,400
evaluation or testing or maybe

79
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:04,159
development environment

80
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:08,319
so uh it's it's really great and it

81
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:08,319
takes just uh five minutes or something

82
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:13,680
if even interested more uh let me invite

83
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,839
you to the openable conference which is

84
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,120
like every year this year it's in in

85
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:21,200
brussels so

86
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,200
just a few a few months later

87
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:30,879
now let's let's uh let's focus on the on

88
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:34,560
the on the edge cloud

89
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:36,399
what is edge cloud for us for us it's uh

90
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,599
the edge clouds are the micro data

91
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,319
centers which

92
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:41,280
are uh with some kind of cloud-like

93
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:44,319
capabilities

94
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:47,840
and are deployed uh very near

95
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:51,119
to the end end users or and devices they

96
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:53,519
they they need to interact with so the

97
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,480
benefits are uh to provide a lower

98
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:57,360
latencies

99
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,840
uh provide like a new features which

100
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,720
this

101
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,560
this lower latencies allows uh probably

102
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,879
some preprocessing can happen and

103
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,000
in the edge cloud so so the data which

104
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:09,760
are sent to the

105
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,760
central cloud are much much lower or

106
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:14,159
there can be a need for due to some

107
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:17,680
security on privacy reasons

108
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:20,000
but everything is not just just a green

109
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,120
or or good there are some some

110
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
limitations

111
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:26,000
limitations comes with a limited offer

112
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,560
of the hardware or software we can we

113
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,720
can we can use in the edge and

114
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:34,720
there are also some risks potential data

115
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:36,720
loss or maintenance overhead and so on

116
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,880
but uh from the perspective of the

117
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,960
openable edge clouds are

118
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:43,040
very similar or should be should be very

119
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,359
similar to the on-premises cloud which

120
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,479
is

121
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:49,520
only on the left side so the

122
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:50,320
like a main difference is we can expect

123
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:53,359
there will be

124
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:54,320
much more uh such uh such uh smaller

125
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,800
clouds

126
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:58,159
and they will have kind of dynamic

127
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,639
nature they can be

128
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,759
created dynamically uh destroyed and

129
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:04,720
anytime

130
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:06,000
at any time we need so they are kind of

131
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,840
ephemeral

132
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,120
they are also restricted and kind of

133
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:12,159
limited from the implementation

134
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,960
perspective

135
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,960
we talk about the infrastructure edge so

136
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:20,080
that's the part of the edge which is

137
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:23,440
uh which is powerful enough to

138
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:26,159
run like more

139
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,360
more more demanding uh computation and

140
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:31,120
so on

141
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:33,199
uh our our aim is to take the technology

142
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,560
we are using for the on-premises cloud

143
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:38,479
or the kvms

144
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:40,720
lxd vx lens and this

145
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:43,120
all these building parts and just move

146
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:46,479
it to the edge cloud

147
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:49,360
of course with help of some

148
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:50,400
specialized drivers and uh in a form

149
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:54,080
which

150
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:57,198
which is uh which is uh like designed to

151
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:57,199
to run in the edge cloud

152
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:03,360
uh we very much rely on the existence of

153
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:06,560
a bare metal cloud

154
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:08,800
so uh openable are never installed the

155
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,000
physical hosts operating system and and

156
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,960
these kind of things

157
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,400
and it won't do so we expect there is

158
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,479
some service provider

159
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,159
uh which manages the infrastructure and

160
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:21,039
is able to give us

161
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:24,319
or give users the resources which can be

162
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:24,318
used to build the edge cloud

163
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:31,280
the second important part is automation

164
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,400
everything is automated on environmental

165
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,799
cloud we don't

166
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,638
like a card that much it's the it's the

167
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:40,160
provider's

168
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:43,039
duty but on the on the host level

169
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:45,199
everything is automated uh hypervisor is

170
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:48,159
installed operating system is configured

171
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:49,680
to to run as as part of like

172
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:53,280
virtualization cluster

173
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:56,080
and it's good to say that

174
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:57,758
the only thing we do is just take all

175
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:00,240
the great open source

176
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:02,479
open source tools we have distribution

177
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,360
hypervisors and so on and put it

178
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:07,680
together

179
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,680
to build open source edge cloud

180
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:15,599
so to summarize the openable edge clouds

181
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:16,880
are just limited open above

182
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:20,719
virtualization clusters

183
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:23,520
you might be running already on premises

184
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,919
they are deployed on infrastructure of

185
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,880
some

186
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:28,240
third party they are managed fully

187
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:31,199
automatically

188
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:33,120
and i've introduced this this kind of

189
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:36,560
buzzword infrastructure service

190
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,560
in infrastructure service

191
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:42,639
because uh when you are running a

192
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,720
virtualization cluster on premises

193
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:47,120
everything is kind of okay for you

194
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,919
you have hosts under full control you

195
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,919
have storage

196
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:52,400
you have network and choose your

197
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:56,719
addresses so

198
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,719
you don't have any problems but

199
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:00,160
if you have to deploy the similar

200
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:04,000
virtualization cluster

201
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:06,800
uh on some third-party infrastructure

202
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,520
probably hosts are also okay storage as

203
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,919
well

204
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:12,080
but when it comes to networking we can

205
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:15,440
expect there will be some limitations

206
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:16,560
introduced by the provider and regarding

207
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,000
the ip addresses

208
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,720
there definitely will be some

209
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,599
restrictions

210
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,160
so these these two things network things

211
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:26,960
are

212
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,520
kind of challenging changing parts we

213
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,318
have

214
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:31,359
we have experienced from the network

215
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:34,560
perspective

216
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:36,560
it's very environment specific because

217
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:38,880
various providers introduces some

218
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:39,518
various features like a dedicated vlans

219
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,679
for you

220
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:43,200
but also some limitations like a no

221
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:45,760
multicast support

222
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,480
so uh the solution or the approach we

223
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:50,240
have to

224
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:52,880
take is introduce some kind of uh

225
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,480
common virtual network model which is

226
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:58,160
able to work

227
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:59,519
no matter on uh independently on the on

228
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,760
the on the provider

229
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:03,040
so we are using the overlay network with

230
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:05,600
vxlans

231
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:09,839
but we don't rely on the multicast so

232
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,839
it's just for the unicustom environment

233
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,959
the more complicated thing is the ip

234
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:17,599
addressing

235
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:18,319
in case of private addressing maybe we

236
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,800
don't care

237
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:22,720
because we have our overlay network and

238
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,240
we can do anything and nobody cares

239
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,560
except us

240
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,720
in case of public ip addresses the

241
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:31,279
situation is much more complicated

242
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,959
because we just can't take our favorite

243
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:35,360
ipv for others

244
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:36,000
and put it into a virtual machine and

245
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,360
expect

246
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,360
that everything will work

247
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:44,160
usually the ip addresses are kind of

248
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:47,279
agreed with the provider

249
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:50,880
you ask the provider for some pool

250
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:54,959
and they give you

251
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,959
some other feedback so

252
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,519
this like a workflow needs to be

253
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:02,800
automated

254
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:05,519
and in case of

255
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,640
edge clouds is automated through some

256
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:09,600
kind of

257
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,160
ip management id management drivers

258
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,120
which

259
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:14,880
exactly comes to the provider and tells

260
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:18,240
give me some ip addresses

261
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:19,040
so but that's one just one part of the

262
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,680
problem

263
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:23,519
the another part of the problem is that

264
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:27,040
you have some ip addresses

265
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:30,720
but usually you need to notify

266
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:33,120
the provider when you want to

267
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,399
use the ib address on the selected host

268
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:37,760
so that uh

269
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:40,320
he updates the routing or or something

270
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,600
to get the traffic to the uh to the to

271
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,320
the right place

272
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:47,839
so about the ip addresses like okay two

273
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,839
problems there

274
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:53,600
the conclusion from this part is simple

275
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:54,480
if you take some existing infrastructure

276
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,519
as a service

277
00:10:54,480 --> 00:11:01,360
framework and try it around to run it

278
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:04,160
even in different or maybe the same

279
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:06,800
infrastructure as a service

280
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:09,600
you can expect the things to work

281
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,599
without problems

282
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:13,120
now about the provisioning

283
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:17,439
about the provisioning and how do we uh

284
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,560
how do we

285
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:21,839
like build these clouds uh openml comes

286
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:24,079
with a set of

287
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:25,360
specialized tools drivers and

288
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:28,959
configurations

289
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:30,240
which simply talks to the providers and

290
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:32,800
builds all the cloud

291
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,600
just like like like with a single

292
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:37,120
command

293
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,680
command run mainly we target on the edge

294
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,240
clouds

295
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,800
but possibly i hope it doesn't have to

296
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,839
be only

297
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,839
only edge clouds

298
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:50,480
so once again it's a one provision tool

299
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,959
which manages the whole life cycle of

300
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,800
this

301
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:54,160
of this edge cloud it's command line

302
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,479
only then

303
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:58,480
we have some kind of integration drivers

304
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:01,519
it's good to say that

305
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,920
when some like a third party or provider

306
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:03,920
is

307
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:05,599
selected there needs to be two kind of

308
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:08,240
drivers one driver

309
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:10,160
which is able to allocate some hosts

310
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:12,880
from the provider or at least the

311
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,360
release the hostel back and the other

312
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:16,639
thing

313
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:20,320
is mentioned ib management

314
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:22,959
integration driver let's say and

315
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:24,079
of course we have a host with base

316
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:27,518
operating system

317
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:29,599
we have some addresses ip addresses then

318
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:30,560
the missing part is to configure the

319
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,760
hosts so that

320
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:37,518
they can be part of openable cluster

321
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:38,160
so the last part is like a configuration

322
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:42,240
playbooks and

323
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:42,240
roles for reference architectures

324
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:48,160
that's what user or cloud administrator

325
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:52,000
usually gets

326
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:53,680
but he has to do something

327
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,560
he has to write some provision

328
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:59,599
descriptor which exactly specifies

329
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:01,599
uh what provider to choose what are the

330
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:04,639
credentials for the provider

331
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:07,839
what hardware configuration

332
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:09,920
to use for for for for the machines uh

333
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:12,000
what to create in in inside the open

334
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,880
envelope or data stores virtual networks

335
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,720
and so on

336
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,920
and also how to configure the host

337
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,240
insight

338
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,279
this is created by the infrastructure

339
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,279
administrator

340
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:23,519
and the process is the high level

341
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:26,399
process is

342
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:26,720
as simple as displayed here so basically

343
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:29,279
uh

344
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,240
prepare the descriptor pass it to the

345
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:34,639
tool

346
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:36,880
wait 10 15 minutes and you will get an

347
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:39,279
independent virtualization cluster at

348
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,279
the edge

349
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:44,479
management features of this tool are

350
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:46,479
like very simple

351
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:48,800
very limited it can create an edge

352
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,880
cluster and destroy the edge cluster

353
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:52,639
and the other other options are more

354
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:56,639
host host focused power

355
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:59,680
of reboot resume and and so on

356
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:01,839
so to summarize the current state

357
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:03,359
we have an integration i would say a

358
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:04,320
good integration with the packet

359
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,639
provider

360
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,399
and we have some partial integration

361
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:10,399
with the ec2

362
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:12,399
we have a tool i will show it a little

363
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:15,680
later hopefully

364
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:17,440
which can deploy the cloud it's more

365
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:19,279
like an advanced tool there are some

366
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:23,519
missing features like a

367
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:25,519
cluster can be scaled out or scaling

368
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:26,639
and the architecture which is deployed

369
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:29,760
there is very simple

370
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:31,120
like a single single static one the

371
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:33,120
future plans

372
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,320
uh as i mentioned in the beginning we

373
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:38,000
have received some

374
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:41,279
funding from european union

375
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:45,040
the idea is to take what we have and

376
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:45,519
build from that some like uh easy to use

377
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:50,160
uh

378
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:50,160
h cloud solution which which uh

379
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:53,839
which uh incorpora incorporates some

380
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:56,560
catalog for

381
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:59,680
for the edge providers and marketplace

382
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:02,560
for the edge application and so on

383
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:04,880
mainly that mean that we will get new

384
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:06,399
integration drivers for new providers

385
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,920
we will get a new features like a

386
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:11,120
cluster scaling or

387
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:12,639
cluster update the work in progress is a

388
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,639
support for lightweight

389
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:15,839
virtual machine monitors like a

390
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:19,120
firecracker

391
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:23,199
and caching data stores and

392
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:23,199
possibly curse locations networking

393
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:30,599
good uh about the documentation

394
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:32,240
if you go to the opennebra or

395
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:34,160
docs.openable.org

396
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,839
there is a section which is called this

397
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:37,839
aggregated data centers

398
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:40,160
which describes all these things and

399
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:41,360
tooling and how to write the provision

400
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:43,360
descriptor or

401
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:46,480
what configurations you can use and how

402
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,480
to parameterize it

403
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:53,120
also i've mentioned the many one tool

404
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:54,560
at the beginning which usually deploys

405
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:58,240
just kvm

406
00:15:54,560 --> 00:16:00,638
or lxd single host and

407
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:02,320
evaluation environment but it can also

408
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:05,279
deploy the edge

409
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,839
as seen on this screenshot it just needs

410
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:08,399
some

411
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:09,120
some parameters like select the provider

412
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:12,639
and

413
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:16,800
give some token and project and it

414
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:16,800
does everything automatically

415
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:21,920
this is not a something like an

416
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:25,440
artificial artificial

417
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:28,160
thing but we have we did some

418
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,880
use case validation demos the most

419
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,959
important

420
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:32,079
or the most interesting thing is the

421
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:34,800
video gaming

422
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:37,920
when we have used this tool to deploy

423
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:41,758
around the world 17 edge locations

424
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:44,399
uh which were like a small kvm clusters

425
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:46,800
and run on each location one virtual

426
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:50,000
machine which was running inside the

427
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:51,758
wolfenstein enemy territory game server

428
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,600
and then from the office we connected to

429
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:56,720
random one in in sydney

430
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:59,440
and we could play and it worked simply

431
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:00,000
it was as easy as running just just a

432
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,959
tool

433
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,480
and waiting unfortunately 25 minutes

434
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:08,079
because

435
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:11,439
some locations like japan took

436
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:14,399
more time than than some other locations

437
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:14,400
which were much nearer

438
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:20,319
we have this nice data sheet we describe

439
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:23,039
all these

440
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:23,918
all these demos uh we can we can give

441
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:25,520
you if you are

442
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:28,240
if you are interested also we have a

443
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:31,520
stickers if you are openable a user or

444
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:35,440
or just interested come come to us

445
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:38,080
and uh we'll give you uh all like

446
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,880
like a details you would be interested

447
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:42,080
in

448
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:46,960
so uh maybe we have some time for demo

449
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:49,039
uh firstly i will probably show uh

450
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:50,640
how the provision descriptor to build

451
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:52,480
the cloud looks like

452
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,760
it doesn't have to be necessary to

453
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,799
understand all

454
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:58,960
the parts but just the concept of what

455
00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:00,000
what's it what is necessary to specify

456
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:03,039
right

457
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,280
so uh on this page

458
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:06,879
uh the most important part is the

459
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:10,000
playbook exactly the

460
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:11,600
configuration applied on the host

461
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,320
then there are some defaults which are

462
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:15,360
specifying the like a driver and and

463
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:17,918
credentials

464
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,799
we are also choosing the bare metal you

465
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:22,160
know

466
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:25,520
hardware type and centos and so on

467
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:28,240
but on the on in the next part we

468
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,879
just list what host and the number we

469
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:32,240
want to

470
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:34,320
we want to deploy then we specify

471
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,440
data stores which should appear in the

472
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,918
open block

473
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:39,120
and the last part are the networks

474
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:41,280
exactly this is the

475
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:42,959
this is the thing which creates the

476
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:46,240
public ip network

477
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:47,039
with the ipam packet driver and it

478
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:50,320
requests

479
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:52,480
two ip addresses to ipv4 addresses from

480
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:56,399
the provider

481
00:18:52,480 --> 00:19:00,080
and there are some private networks

482
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,080
so basically this is enough

483
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:04,000
and i've started this provision command

484
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:06,160
before i

485
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,400
before i started the presentation and

486
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:12,640
you can see it took

487
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:17,520
20 minutes oh sorry 12 minutes

488
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:21,760
to deploy uh two hosts

489
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:21,760
to deploy three virtual networks

490
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:28,960
and some some data stores uh

491
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:31,919
maybe i can i can try to stop try to

492
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:34,320
start some virtual machine i have to do

493
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:34,320
some

494
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:39,840
some like a workaround

495
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:45,679
to make this working because i have

496
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:48,799
alpine image here

497
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:49,440
locally on my laptop and i just share it

498
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:53,200
to the

499
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:59,039
edge cluster i've right now deployed

500
00:19:53,200 --> 00:20:04,080
and i go to the open envelope

501
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:04,080
i'll make it a little smaller

502
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:11,600
yeah i'm finishing and

503
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:12,480
the thing is that i will run this alpine

504
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,158
linux

505
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:16,400
on the edge cluster i have right now

506
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:19,679
deployed it would run as is the

507
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:22,320
what is the what is the

508
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:23,200
the interesting part is the networking

509
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:26,320
so

510
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:27,919
i will specify a host on a network not

511
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:31,760
to break it

512
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:35,840
and i will give it an alias

513
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:35,840
for the public networking

514
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:52,480
so maybe i can try two virtual machines

515
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:56,000
good and

516
00:20:52,480 --> 00:21:00,159
if we wait for like 20 30

517
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:04,400
seconds it's already deploying

518
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:04,400
we can check what is the host exactly

519
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:08,559
oh okay

520
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:15,919
we can't check but trust me it's a it's

521
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:19,200
a packet hosted

522
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:20,640
machine in in amsterdam yeah maybe i can

523
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:23,200
show the packet dashboard

524
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:25,159
it was updated so you can see this is

525
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:28,000
the fosdem note

526
00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:31,840
7577 which is exactly what is what is

527
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,840
in here

528
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:42,480
yeah the unfortunate thing is that it's

529
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:47,360
copying the image

530
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:50,559
but uh if that happens

531
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:51,120
we should be able to to ping the virtual

532
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:54,480
machine

533
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:57,439
there so and that that that's the goal

534
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:59,600
that's the goal on third provider on

535
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:02,480
third parties infrastructure

536
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:04,799
be able to build a kvm lxd

537
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:07,679
virtualization cluster we are used to

538
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:10,080
and have the most of the features we are

539
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:12,480
used to from the on-prem on premises

540
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:14,639
and also be kind of integrated with the

541
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:18,080
provider have a public network working

542
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:21,600
and so on so

543
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:24,879
yeah let's check the first one just

544
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:27,280
it's booting and i can just try to log

545
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,280
login

546
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:32,559
well i could log in there i can check

547
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:34,879
the

548
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:36,480
i've config and i can see the the

549
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:39,120
private address which is

550
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,720
assigned inside is the very same it's

551
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:43,120
0.3 address

552
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:45,280
and trust me that it's the alpine linux

553
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:50,320
i just deployed i can see this

554
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:50,320
time 0 minutes so that's it

555
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:56,158
the very last thing i will show is that

556
00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:00,320
the way i've created this this

557
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:03,760
virtualization graph cluster in just

558
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:06,720
12 minutes i can destroy this cluster

559
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,720
the very same

560
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:14,479
the very same way i just need to

561
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:14,480
remove the heck i did it previously

562
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,960
i'm trying to list the provisions

563
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:26,320
delete it and it won't work right now

564
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:27,600
because we have running virtual machines

565
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:31,120
there

566
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:32,959
but i can ask it to clean up

567
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:34,879
and it simply terminates the virtual

568
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:38,640
machines

569
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:42,480
both and when it's done

570
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:45,919
it cancels the hosts and releases the ip

571
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,919
addresses back to the provider

572
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:53,360
let's check

573
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:54,240
there are no hosts and we can check the

574
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:56,879
packet

575
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:58,159
that everything was released they are

576
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:01,120
not updating it

577
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:01,120
and here is nothing

578
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:07,600
so as said we have this uh this this

579
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:08,159
datasheet here describing the use cases

580
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:11,120
and

581
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:12,320
and uh and plans you can talk to us if

582
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:19,840
you are interested

583
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:19,840
also with the stickers please come to us

584
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:32,240
thank you
