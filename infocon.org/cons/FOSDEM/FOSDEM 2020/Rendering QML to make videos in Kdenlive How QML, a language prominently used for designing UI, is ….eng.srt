1
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:09,679
let's start

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:11,120
okay so we move on to our next

3
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:12,880
presentation

4
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:15,120
let me remind you that this year we're

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:17,680
trying something new to the questions

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,279
so you can log into onlinequestions.org

7
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:22,320
with the event id 20

8
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:24,400
147 147 in our room number

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,320
and you can ask questions there or vote

10
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:29,038
for your favorite questions

11
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,640
so our netflix alex presenter ikea will

12
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:35,350
introduce qml

13
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:38,549
in the video industry good work on ikea

14
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:38,549
[Applause]

15
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:45,360
thank you morning and hello i'm akel

16
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:48,640
and today i'm here to talk about

17
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:51,680
how in ktm live we're trying to

18
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:54,640
uh create videos out of qml

19
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,960
so let's get started a bit about myself

20
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,160
i

21
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:00,719
am i'm pursuing i'm a student

22
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:03,440
at amrita university uh pursuing my

23
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:05,760
undergrad studies in computer science

24
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,720
and i've been a kitty kitten live

25
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,000
contributor for

26
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,400
more than a year now i i was part of

27
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,200
them

28
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,960
uh last summer as part of the summer of

29
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,320
code program

30
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:20,320
and i'm a part of am foss it's

31
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:22,399
a student community back in my college

32
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:24,720
so it's just a bunch of

33
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,640
students who contribute to a bunch of

34
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:29,119
open source software and

35
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,960
over the years we had a lot of students

36
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:32,320
taking part in various open source

37
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,640
programs

38
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,079
in various organizations through these

39
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,320
student programs

40
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:39,600
and especially if i were to say uh we

41
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:42,000
have a lot of people

42
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,720
in the open media especially in the

43
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,240
media

44
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:48,720
field uh just to name a few mind freeze

45
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,079
krishna here uh yeah we are from the

46
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:54,560
same bunch

47
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:57,199
and yeah uh that's that so let's start

48
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,200
with the why

49
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:06,320
why would you take qml a language

50
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:09,119
a language you would use to create ui

51
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:10,318
ui applications yeah qml is something

52
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:12,800
you would use

53
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:13,440
if you were a cute application uh

54
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,840
developer

55
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:18,160
acute is a cross-platform uh software

56
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,959
development platform using c plus plus

57
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:22,079
so qml is something that you would use

58
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:25,120
to uh

59
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:27,440
that you would use to actually uh design

60
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,800
your application interface uh qml

61
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,280
defines the

62
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,360
behavior and how how your application

63
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:37,440
should look like so if i have a button

64
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:40,560
on my window qml will i can use qml to

65
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:42,239
say where where i can place this button

66
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,400
and how this button will behave and

67
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:49,120
stuff like that that's what qml is

68
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:52,080
used for so uh qml uh does this by

69
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,040
you know order it has a it doesn't it it

70
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,640
orders the

71
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,079
you know the interface elements in a

72
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,879
hierarchical manner

73
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,720
so there's the child parent thing in qml

74
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:03,760
so why would you take qml

75
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:07,440
such a it's like javascript so

76
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:10,480
yeah why would you take qml to create

77
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:12,879
videos so that's that

78
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:15,359
that's that that's the end result what

79
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:17,518
we managed to do in ktm live right now

80
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,040
that's a qml file by the way in the

81
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:22,080
cadillac clip monitor

82
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:25,519
uh that's actually playing and

83
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:28,799
yeah so why do it a

84
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:30,080
passing xml sucks and b qml is actually

85
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:32,239
awesome so

86
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,200
let me tell you where we do this in

87
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:36,239
caden live

88
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:39,440
uh we actually do this in the title tour

89
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,840
so in caden live uh the video editor uh

90
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:43,280
we

91
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:46,080
actually have a title too so what we use

92
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,879
the title tool uh is to create title

93
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,480
clips

94
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:50,239
now what title clips are they are

95
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:53,840
basically clips of

96
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:55,680
which clips which contain text or images

97
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,200
uh which you can later you know uh

98
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,720
composite over

99
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,879
used to composite over your videos

100
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,400
suppose if you want to add subtitles or

101
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:03,679
you want to add the credits

102
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,959
at the end of your video you use the

103
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:09,680
title 2 for that so

104
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,000
how it works currently in kdn live is

105
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,519
you

106
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,200
uh the caden live title clip is

107
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:17,840
basically an xml file

108
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,880
which describe how it should look like

109
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:20,638
and

110
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:23,120
what we do in the back end is we

111
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:24,240
actually pass this xml we pass each of

112
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:27,360
the attributes

113
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:29,840
text image we do that and then we uh

114
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,600
create a queue graphics view to describe

115
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:35,280
this xml and then

116
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:37,919
we render it so that's a hefty process

117
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:40,239
and uh no one uses cube graphics view

118
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:43,280
it's depreciated that's one reason

119
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,520
why this process sucks and second reason

120
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,080
is

121
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:47,520
it's it's a lot of it's a lot of code

122
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:51,198
it's a lot of lines of code

123
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:52,320
and yeah uh that that those two reasons

124
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:55,360
why

125
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:58,479
uh it is not really that

126
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:01,680
nice to do this so the second reason

127
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:04,960
yeah so why use qml because uh

128
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,440
rendering let me tell you how rendering

129
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:10,799
works

130
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:13,280
in qml so uh since security quick two uh

131
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,880
rendering in qml uh makes use of the

132
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:17,840
cute scene graph

133
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,240
now the scene graph is a common term in

134
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,320
the

135
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,680
rendering world it's a data structure

136
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:24,479
which uh

137
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,759
which basically represents how the q qml

138
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:27,919
item scene looks like

139
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:29,759
so as i told you the qml qml is

140
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:32,159
basically you know a child

141
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:35,759
parent thing so uh seeinggraph will

142
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:38,720
actually order this thing and

143
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:39,600
during the rendering process uh so yeah

144
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,880
so that's what the

145
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:44,800
cute scene graph is now as against uh

146
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:47,280
traditional you know imperative

147
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,840
uh painting systems like you painter

148
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,880
this is

149
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:51,758
a much faster way to render stuff

150
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:55,120
because

151
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:58,639
the cute scene graph actually takes uh

152
00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:02,800
lesser state changes to render say

153
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:06,000
if you have uh if you have to render 30

154
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:08,240
background images so instead of 30

155
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,120
imperative painting calls you would just

156
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,280
do

157
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,400
one just take one call on the scene

158
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:15,840
graph

159
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:19,359
so yeah that's how uh that's how qd

160
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:21,919
quick content is actually rendered in uh

161
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,680
in the back end so this is a big

162
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:25,680
advantage because we don't really have

163
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:29,680
to pass stuff

164
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:33,280
and yeah so that's uh qml uh rendering

165
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,759
uh yeah so there's a way to actually

166
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,960
tweak

167
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:39,199
this uh excuse me tweak this process so

168
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:41,198
now i want you to imagine how we would

169
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:44,880
want to take qml

170
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:48,319
and if we want to make a video out of it

171
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:51,599
so the native approach would be to

172
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:55,199
you know load this qml in a quick window

173
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:56,639
and then you know uh then uh call a grab

174
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:59,520
window for each

175
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:00,800
frame so that's the native approach you

176
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:03,039
can just uh

177
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,560
you can just call a grab window for each

178
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:08,560
frame that goes by and

179
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:12,160
uh this one sucks because

180
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:14,319
a uh it takes a lot of time suppose your

181
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:16,800
qml file takes uh

182
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:17,520
five minutes from beginning to end it

183
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,880
would take

184
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,120
five minutes to actually render the

185
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:23,919
whole thing because this thing is like

186
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,639
screen recording it will take each frame

187
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:27,758
and two

188
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:31,759
grab window is expensive as you all know

189
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:33,759
it calls the opengl uh graph pixels so

190
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:35,199
it's expensive and it's time consuming

191
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:37,840
so what we

192
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:39,039
uh how we can tweak this to make it a

193
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:41,758
lot more faster

194
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:42,318
is to make use of this magical class

195
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,599
called

196
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:49,039
quick render control so as the name says

197
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:52,080
render control it allows you to control

198
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:52,400
the the different steps in the in the

199
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:55,758
whole

200
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:59,198
rendering group so now when you use this

201
00:07:55,759 --> 00:08:01,199
uh class you don't actually need that

202
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:02,879
window you can actually just you know

203
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:06,479
tell the renderer to actually

204
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:08,080
uh render your qml onto a frame buffer

205
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:10,639
object which you can you know just

206
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:12,080
uh use it for your image later so that's

207
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:14,160
a quick render control

208
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:15,840
allows you to do so that's what we are

209
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:19,280
trying to do we have tried to

210
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:21,599
uh load a qml file uh you

211
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:23,119
use this class and directly render

212
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:26,719
render this qml

213
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:29,919
onto a frame buffer object and save it

214
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:32,880
so yeah and i'm not going to go uh

215
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:33,279
too much into technical because it might

216
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,958
get

217
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:37,919
bit boring so yeah so when you do this

218
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:40,159
you get

219
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:41,199
getting obviously a lot more freedom to

220
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:44,000
do it but you

221
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,800
you will have to handle the context and

222
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,720
the

223
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:49,279
and the frame buffer object and

224
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:52,839
threading and stuff like that so

225
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:55,600
that's that and yeah

226
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:56,640
oops yeah so the stuff i just talked

227
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,200
about

228
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,880
we got this idea from this blog so you

229
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,240
can just look it up if you are really

230
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:04,720
into technical uh

231
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,440
if you're into the technical details uh

232
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:09,360
by andy

233
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:12,480
on the cute blog so uh it's it's it's

234
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,440
it's it's a great blog uh how uh handy

235
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,519
actually

236
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,519
observed that people were using the cube

237
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:20,240
api in ways that they

238
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,800
that you know they weren't supposed to

239
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,800
and

240
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,839
he just uh sought out to make an example

241
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:27,439
out of that

242
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:28,720
and that's the result so you can find

243
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:31,760
the code uh there

244
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:33,040
it's i think production ready uh that's

245
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:36,560
the qm i call it the

246
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:39,920
qml renderer it's a library it has uh

247
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:43,279
you can actually even uh test it out on

248
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:44,399
uh you can just go qml you go the input

249
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:47,200
file

250
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:48,399
with the uh qml file you tell how many

251
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,760
frames you want

252
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:51,680
and you can just give the output

253
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,480
directory and you will get those many

254
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:55,920
frames

255
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:56,959
and uh by default be jpg or whatever you

256
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,920
want

257
00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:01,040
so you can even uh tell uh which format

258
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:04,640
you want and

259
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:07,199
yeah so what now we have the frames

260
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,680
so most of the heavy lifting is done now

261
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,480
now

262
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:12,479
uh we have taken a qml file we have uh

263
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,880
rendered it we got the frames

264
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:17,440
now we just need to you know combine it

265
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:20,720
together and play it

266
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:24,079
so yeah now mlt so

267
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:27,120
kirin live uses uh

268
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:30,479
as its back end it uses an open source

269
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:33,040
multimedia framework called mlt so mlc

270
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:35,360
was originally uh it's a

271
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,079
it was made for broadcasting services so

272
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,880
it's

273
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:39,519
uh loosely based on the design on the

274
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,880
consumer

275
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:43,519
producer uh design pattern so what we

276
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:46,320
need here

277
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:46,959
is we have cured some qml frames and we

278
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,640
need to

279
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:53,439
you know have a military producer so

280
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:54,160
in order to you know play that qml file

281
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:57,600
so yeah

282
00:10:54,160 --> 00:11:00,319
uh it's not that hard really

283
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,040
i just uh this was done around a month

284
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,800
ago

285
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:06,160
and we right now we have an mlc producer

286
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:09,839
we can which can actually

287
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:13,120
play a qml file so

288
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:15,519
uh yeah so

289
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:17,600
you can find the code there for the mlt

290
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:21,279
producer if you want to

291
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:24,399
uh tweak play with it and uh yeah

292
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:26,720
uh it's the demo yeah so you just

293
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:28,079
if you want to test it out you just go m

294
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:31,920
lt's

295
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:35,439
is the command line interface for uh mlt

296
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:37,920
so uh you go just

297
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,360
you just tell melt which producer to use

298
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:41,920
that's qml

299
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,959
and you tell it the input file so that

300
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:45,680
will uh just

301
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:47,439
you know uh tell you to tell there you

302
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:50,239
go it just plays it there you can

303
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,800
see the you can see the frames changing

304
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:54,399
there

305
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:57,599
so that's uh that's how mlt does it

306
00:11:54,399 --> 00:12:00,720
and uh yeah so

307
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:02,079
uh uh we are done with qml we are done

308
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:05,200
with qml rendering

309
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:08,800
we got the frames now uh we got

310
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:11,760
our uh we are able to play it

311
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,639
and uh the next process the next step

312
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:15,839
yeah

313
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:16,480
uh we have actually tried to we tried to

314
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:19,040
put that

315
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,320
in kdn live uh this work is currently

316
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:23,040
ongoing

317
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:24,000
and uh uh which what we've done here is

318
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,480
just connect the

319
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,600
producer to the clip monitoring kdn live

320
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,920
so that's the

321
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,279
uh clip pointer you get after you you

322
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:34,319
know you after you drag

323
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:35,680
a qml file onto the bin so you can just

324
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:38,800
play the file

325
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:42,160
that thing doesn't move but it's playing

326
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:45,599
so yeah i've got so far

327
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:48,319
uh we have this is still

328
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,279
in process because we are not there yet

329
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,399
uh

330
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:55,920
the cure the mlc producer can't

331
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:58,560
yet uh animate uh

332
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:59,680
animated qml frames just static ones

333
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:02,479
because

334
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:03,599
uh for our initial testing we thought

335
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:07,760
let's start with this

336
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:10,880
and uh it works fine so far

337
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:14,639
and uh yeah uh moving on

338
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:18,079
uh what's next so yeah as i said

339
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:20,079
uh we need animated qml support

340
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:21,599
uh we need uh that's an obvious

341
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:24,479
requirement if we were to

342
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,200
create a new title tool in the future

343
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:29,279
and

344
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:32,639
uh qm uh obviously having animated qml

345
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:34,720
is an uh requirement and yeah we

346
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:36,160
once we have that and once you've

347
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,079
completed the integration of

348
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:39,439
the current producer and we're done with

349
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:42,160
testing uh

350
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,560
it completely with kdnlive because so

351
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:46,240
far

352
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:49,599
uh facing some issues with handling it

353
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:50,880
in the timeline and uh we'll be looking

354
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:54,240
into that soon but

355
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:54,639
uh once that is done i suppose we could

356
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,760
just

357
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:58,880
move on and uh uh move on with the

358
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:02,160
titler tool

359
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:06,240
so uh this is what i did uh for my

360
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:09,839
last summer of course program and uh

361
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:13,120
yeah so uh last summer i worked on

362
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:16,320
uh creating the qml render library

363
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,720
and uh after that the work was to create

364
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,839
the

365
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:22,720
mlt producer and which was done

366
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:23,440
a couple of months ago and right now we

367
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:27,279
are into

368
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:30,560
creating the uh we are into integrating

369
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:33,040
this producer into ktm live and

370
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,599
and yeah once that is done uh we will

371
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,920
actually

372
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:38,480
uh start to think about how we are going

373
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:41,120
to design the new title tool uh about

374
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:42,160
the about the interface about how we're

375
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,720
going to change it

376
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:45,920
about what things we're going to add and

377
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:49,120
uh

378
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:52,240
after that is done we can actually uh

379
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:54,480
possibly uh get it uh done and maybe or

380
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,920
maybe i don't know in some time i can't

381
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:59,279
really say

382
00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:03,199
and uh yeah so

383
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:05,590
i guess i'm i'm really done uh

384
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:08,709
yeah so if you have any questions

385
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:08,710
[Music]

386
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:15,519
we have one question online so on

387
00:15:12,519 --> 00:15:15,519
onlinequestions.org

388
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:19,439
and it says do you think this approach

389
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,480
could be used for 24 7 live playout

390
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:24,000
system

391
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:27,360
well um it really

392
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,600
because you could because you are really

393
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:31,279
creating frames but i'm not sure about

394
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:34,079
the performance

395
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:35,680
you could in theory create an mlt

396
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:38,479
producer to do that

397
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:39,279
or something else which is more feasible

398
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:42,320
but

399
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:44,959
so far what i have noticed is

400
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,560
it's not really that quick the qml

401
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:48,719
renderer

402
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:51,359
but in theory you should be able to do

403
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,360
it because

404
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,639
in the end you are just creating frames

405
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:59,920
and you just need to play them so

406
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:03,199
i'm not sure about the feasibility but

407
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:05,120
maybe next question

408
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:08,240
how do you manage video rendering time

409
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:10,720
on qml side

410
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:12,079
how do we manage our video rendering

411
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:15,680
time on qm also

412
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:19,040
really get that question uh

413
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:21,519
well uh we have suppose

414
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:22,719
if we have a static qml frame where we

415
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:24,720
really don't have

416
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,959
animations you don't need to worry about

417
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:30,079
the time it takes

418
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:33,839
uh rendering time okay all right

419
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:33,839
the time it takes to render i

420
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,319
of this guess of this frame how do you

421
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:41,680
make it

422
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:43,759
oh all right all right okay okay that

423
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:47,439
makes sense

424
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:49,120
oh yeah all right yeah well the approach

425
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:52,160
right now how it works is

426
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:54,000
we just there's an animation driver so

427
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:55,120
we have actually uh we have a custom

428
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,000
animation driver

429
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,880
which we have overridden so if we want a

430
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,959
certain frame

431
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:02,800
at a certain point of time what we do is

432
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:05,678
we just advance to that

433
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:08,720
point of time and we get that frame

434
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:08,720
that's how we do it right now

435
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:14,240
that may not be efficient but we are

436
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:19,120
getting there

437
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:22,640
any other question from the floor

438
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:24,958
oh raise your hand yeah

439
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:26,480
uh aside from like title sequences do

440
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:28,000
you see this potentially as something

441
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,120
suitable for like over-the-shoulder

442
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,080
graphics

443
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:32,399
or like banners you know some that you

444
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:36,399
know

445
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:39,600
more oriented around like real time uh

446
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:42,960
presentations as opposed to

447
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:46,159
content so the question is uh

448
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:47,520
yeah the question is if we can use this

449
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,840
approach to actually

450
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:52,799
uh for more a wider range of

451
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:55,120
applications such as presentations or

452
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:56,320
banners or stuff so yeah the answer is

453
00:17:55,120 --> 00:18:00,239
definitely a yes

454
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:03,918
because you have the entire qml spectrum

455
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:06,160
which you can use to design stuff so uh

456
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:07,760
i don't really i didn't really face a

457
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:10,880
limitation till now

458
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:12,320
because we are rendering using the scene

459
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:15,520
graph so there is no

460
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:19,039
uh limitation per se of what we render

461
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:20,879
so if we can render qml successfully

462
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:22,640
we can actually connect it to anything

463
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:28,080
we want to

464
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:30,400
so yeah sensors yes

465
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,399
question

466
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:43,840
no well thank you ikea thank you

467
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:51,680
[Music]

468
00:18:52,919 --> 00:18:55,919
okay
