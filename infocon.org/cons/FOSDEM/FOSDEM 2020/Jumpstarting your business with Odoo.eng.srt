so here's where you need to make a

8
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:30,480
choice

9
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,000
because this is my introductory slide

10
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,320
about me there are two

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,760
choices oh one choice should i do the

12
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,200
high impact

13
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,599
um presentation of me or should i do a

14
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,879
low

15
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:46,320

it's about me high impact on low impact

18
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:54,640
who's in favor of the low impact

19
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:56,800
okay one two three four who's in favor

20
00:00:54,640 --> 00:01:00,160
of the high impact

21
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:02,559
that's clearly a majority okay so

22
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:05,280
don't blame i didn't warn you right uh

23
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:07,920
there's going to be a high impact

24
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,720
and it's an experiment this is the

25
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,720
second time i

26
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:15,200

27
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:18,000
after this slide i'll ask you if i

28
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:21,439

you know you put yourself out there away

83
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,120

84
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:54,238
subject so

85
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:56,000

88
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:04,480
it's very cool um don't let the fact

89
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,040
that it's been four years since the last

90
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,280
release

91
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,959
scare you off but i had other things to

92
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,319
do as you could see by the introductory

93
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:13,519
slide

94
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:14,720
but last week i was at the notary so

95
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,079
there's now an official liverpool

96
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:19,600
enterprise company

97
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:22,000
and we're really going to reboot it

98
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:25,360
apologies first about my english other

99
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:29,680
people here from the uk

100
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:31,360
okay so i thanks i'll try not to make

101
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,960
really lame jokes about the current

102
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,840
brexit situation

103
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:37,520
but it's i'm pretty spontaneous so i

104
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:40,000
can't really

105
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:41,039
guarantee that i won't but it's not i'm

106
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,479
not trying out

107
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,320
inside it's just making bad jokes you

108
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:47,280
know i'm not trying to insult people

109
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:48,639
um but the the dutch they speak english

110
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:52,000
but they take everything

111
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:54,639
literally and uh this is best

112
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,080
uh shown by by this table i once found

113
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:58,000
somewhere on facebook

114
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,199
if a british guy says with all due

115
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,800
respect

116
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:04,560
he means i think you're wrong and i hear

117
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,320
he's listening to me he's respecting me

118
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:10,080
we've got a nice dialogue going

119
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:13,280
right and there are several

120
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:16,639
things that i don't know by heart so

121
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:18,320
i'm probably mess up um

122
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:19,759
other people from other countries i'll

123
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:22,560
probably mess up too

124
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:23,680
but that's another culture right okay

125
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:27,120
the reason for this

126
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:28,639
talk tell you how i did things that's it

127
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,160
there's no hidden agenda it's just

128
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:33,600
telling you how i

129
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:38,800
did this uh and what is this

130
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:41,840
um well what is who knows about odoo

131
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:43,680
okay so a lot of people don't right who

132
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:46,320
doesn't know about audu

133
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,600
see that's a majority okay so odoo is

134
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,680
python based

135
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:52,320
it's written by a belgian company mainly

136
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,919
but it's got a big open source community

137
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:56,240
it's used all over the world and it's

138
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:57,680
sort of an erp

139
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,960
kind of system you know enterprise

140
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,880
resource planning you can do your

141
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,799
finances you can you do your logistics

142
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,880

143
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,160

all that kind of business processing

147
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,160
stuff

148
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,159
it's all in there they've got a

149
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,440
community edition which is of course

150
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:21,840
free and they've got an enterprise

151
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:21,840
edition which is of course not free

152
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:26,720
like wikipedia says all-in-one business

153
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:28,800

community enterprise edition has also

161
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:43,680

162
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:47,599
are

163
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:50,479
sort of doing their thing in open source

164
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:52,639
connecting to odoo and has a large get

165
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:54,960
up repo with many adults

166
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:56,000
how what does it look like well this is

167
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,560
your main

168
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,199
could be this could be a personalized

169
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,199
main menu

170
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:07,599
and this is where you install one of the

171
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:09,919
standard 360 apps that's on the standard

172
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:13,199
system so you can expand on that

173
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:14,080
and this is just a screen where you see

174
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,319
your crm

175
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:18,240
your customer relations management your

176
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:20,880
sales your opportunities

177
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,560
um that are currently playing you know

178
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,400
there's a potential customer

179
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,240
what's the chance that he will be

180
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,400
interested what do you think

181
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:32,080
he will buy or not what do you think he

182
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:32,080
will spend on your company or not

183
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:36,400
and what's the project go my project

184
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:38,880
goal

185
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:40,638
i have been asked to write a book about

186
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,800
odoo

187
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:44,479
somebody asked me to write a book and my

188
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,919
answer was no

189
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:48,159
because in the netherlands writing a

190
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,159
book

191
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:52,800
is a poor man's job if you write a

192
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,440
bestseller

193
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:58,160
you have to think every copy sold is

194
00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:00,080
about one euro for the author

195
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,520
it doesn't matter what book any book in

196
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:04,719
any bookstore

197
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:07,520
and anywhere in the world is about 1 150

198
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,400
a thick book is maybe 2 euros for the

199
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:11,840
author

200
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:13,359
so if you sell 80 000 copies which is a

201
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:15,119
bestseller in the netherlands

202
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,720
and you do three books a year you've got

203
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,280
a very good salary

204
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:21,599
but if you're into i t and i guess most

205
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:24,000
of us pool slobs are

206
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:24,800
then maybe you sell 600 copies which

207
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,039
means you can

208
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:29,039
go one time for a very fancy dinner but

209
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:30,960
that's it

210
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:32,399
but this guy approached me and said i

211
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,120
want you to write a book about ado and i

212
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:35,200
said no

213
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,959
yeah but i want you to write you've

214
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,839
write you've written before you're into

215
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:41,119
open source

216
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:44,959
you can talk about it pretty well

217
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:46,720
i guess actually i met him

218
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:48,640
when i did a talk in the northern part

219
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:51,120
of spain

220
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:52,720
two dutch guys there and 300 people and

221
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,360
we end up with each other well talking

222
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:57,920
anyway

223
00:08:53,360 --> 00:09:01,040
don't get me wrong and

224
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:01,519
so i said well i've been happily married

225
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,560
for

226
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:06,800
13 years and my wife's just

227
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,239
had just finished a contract management

228
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:11,920
course for her work

229
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,959
she said invite him for dinner and let's

230
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,719
talk about this

231
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:16,079
so he invited him for dinner we talked

232
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,160
about this

233
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,839
and turned out that she said well this

234
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:22,560
is basically a project and the project

235
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:23,040
is just an hourly rate so he said that's

236
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:28,319
fine

237
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:31,760
we agreed on a a modest fee

238
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:33,920
and so this is a project

239
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:35,519
that i'm now standing here i'm not

240
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:38,959
getting paid this is just me

241
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:41,519
returning to share some knowledge

242
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:44,000
after 20 years of gaining knowledge at

243
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:44,000
fosdem

244
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:49,760
and he wants this book targeted at fresh

245
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,080
startups

246
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:53,360
so really low barrier to entry if you

247
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:56,399
want to start a business

248
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:58,560
start with odoo that's what he wants to

249
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:00,320
the message he wants to get across and

250
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,319
he has a vision for that

251
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:05,120
and it's a good vision i think so yeah

252
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:07,040
sure i'll write a book about it

253
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:10,399
how do you can help them grow their

254
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:13,920
business it has to be in british english

255
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:17,120
and i talked earlier about my english

256
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:20,000
so you know but

257
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,880
one of my daughters after finishing high

258
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,920
school

259
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,880
did about a half a year add on trey a

260
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,199
course

261
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:28,399
she paid for all completely herself in

262
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,839
london

263
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:31,519
because she loved the english language

264
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:32,320
and wanted to learn more about it so she

265
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:37,120
really

266
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:39,600
um dove into the subject in london and

267
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,399
i asked her if she could spell check my

268
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,480
book

269
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:43,839
i gave her a red pen and i got a red

270
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:48,160
pages almost

271
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:51,040
all stack of red pages back um

272
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:52,719
anyway it's corrected now and the

273
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:56,480
manuscript is says

274
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:59,040
correctly and i love to do talks

275
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:01,279
so i thought this may be some nice

276
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:03,040
subject and to spread the word to other

277
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:06,880
countries about

278
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:09,040
what we're doing here is also a reason

279
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:12,640
now steps i took in this project

280
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:15,920
i wrote the book the it's very

281
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:18,319
simple i developed a logo and um

282
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:19,279
i register the domain i talk about the

283
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,720
book

284
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:22,399
now let's get into a bit of detail you

285
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:25,600
know let's let's take these steps

286
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:28,000
one slide at a time writing a book

287
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,120
get for version control if you don't

288
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,480
know git

289
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:35,120
i'm not going to explain it to you

290
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,800
the source is an ascii dock or basically

291
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:41,760
as a doctor

292
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:45,199
pdf that's my go-to tool for this book

293
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:46,720
because it creates pdf uh i use a

294
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,880
special build script and that's all

295
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:50,160
always in any project your build script

296
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:52,959
is what you make

297
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:55,040
to combine your source files with ascii

298
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:58,079
doc or ascii doctor dash pdf

299
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,560
to get to a pdf so that's depend on the

300
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:01,040
book

301
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:02,638
your your build script will change and

302
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:05,920
publish it publishing it

303
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:07,360
on lulu.com now this is not a a

304
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:09,839
commercial message but

305
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,959
lulu.com is publishing on demand so you

306
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:14,560
upload a pdf

307
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:17,279
of the content you upload a pdf of the

308
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:19,119
the the cover and then anybody in the

309
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:22,320
world

310
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:24,079
well you could make the url hidden so

311
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,880
only you can order the books

312
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:28,880
or you can make the url public and then

313
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,399
anybody can order the books

314
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:32,240
and as soon as somebody orders the books

315
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:36,839
that's when it's written

316
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:38,800
at a print shop sort of nearish to your

317
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:40,079
location

318
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,319
and the funny thing is about this

319
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:44,638
there's no stock

320
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,360
so after normally if you go to a

321
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:48,240
publisher

322
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:49,760
they they have some 1500 copies printed

323
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,040
and they put it in their warehouse and

324
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:54,720
when it's done

325
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:58,160
it's done sorry books out of

326
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:59,600
out of stock with lulu it's never out of

327
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:01,760
stock

328
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:03,279
and it's very easy to update if somebody

329
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:05,839
says boy

330
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:07,600
there's an error on page whatever i

331
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:08,959
correct the error i run the build script

332
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,600
i upload pdf so

333
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:12,638
15 minutes later i have an up-to-date

334
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:16,240
corrected book

335

for sale in the shop

336
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,279
okay designing a logo i'm

337
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,360
i don't know if i need to tell this but

338
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:28,639
i'm a geek

339
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,519
and geeks are worse in design bad in

340
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:32,880
design

341
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:37,440
i'm bad in design i've now

342
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:40,880
have i've created a few websites

343
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:44,079
the message is correct but it looks

344
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:46,240
like crap right um

345
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:48,239
so i think tech nerds don't do design

346
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:52,079
they shouldn't

347
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:55,760
but then there's fiverr with two r's

348
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:58,399
and fiver is a sort of a

349
00:13:55,760 --> 00:14:00,560
a web shop with designers from all over

350
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:03,199
the world and those are designers

351
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,599
that's their thing that's in their dna

352
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:06,240
where

353
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,440
tech and and nerdy geeky stuff is in my

354
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:11,519
dna

355
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:14,560
designing is in their dna so you can um

356
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:15,199
uh commission look somebody's design

357
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,839
work said

358
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:18,319
will you make a design for me it's it

359
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:22,800
can be

360
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:23,600
very cheap one of those designs i will

361
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:27,680
show you

362
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:29,199
was made by a woman in indonesia 475

363
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:32,399
euros

364
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:35,519
which is in indonesia

365
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:36,399
well it's the daily wage three euros a

366
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:40,000
day

367
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:43,040
so it's enough for

368
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:46,480
three thirty hundred for two months

369
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:49,760
right okay i got at the end of

370
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:52,079
i um i had two great logos

371
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:54,240
and i paid both of them and the result

372
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:58,160
well this was a logo that i loved

373
00:14:54,240 --> 00:15:00,160
you know it's the jump that that

374
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:02,319
i found nice and then there's the other

375
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:05,360
one it's also a jump

376
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,360
a little more funny

377
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:12,399
and it took me a long while to

378
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:13,839
make a decision which one i chose for

379
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:16,959
the book which one would you

380
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:16,959
who would choose this one

381
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:21,760
okay who would choose this one

382
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:27,360
that's a minority let's go back to the

383
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:30,720
fact that i said i can't design

384
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:32,880
because i chose this one okay

385
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,560
clearly i should have chosen this one

386
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:38,000
right that's a clear majority

387
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:40,079
that's good for me to know thanks okay

388
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,120
then there is designing the cover i have

389
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:43,758
my content it's

390
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:45,920
content it's in a pdf i upload it and i

391
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:48,240
have inkscape

392
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:51,439
i'm assuming people know what inkscape

393
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:55,440
is who doesn't know what inkscape is

394
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:57,040
okay inkscape is a do you know what

395
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,279
is

396
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,639
okay so that's pixel-oriented graphics

397
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:03,600
the other type of graphics

398
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:04,720
is vector-oriented graphics like

399
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:08,079
illustrator

400
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:10,399
exactly so that's inkscape um

401
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:11,680
and then when you upload the pdf you get

402
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:14,800
a cover and the cover

403
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:16,239
has a backside then the spine it's

404
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,920
called in english

405
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,920
i learned and then there's the front

406
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:22,479
cover but together that's

407
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:23,199
spread if you if you remove the the

408
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,880
content

409
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:26,880
and you make it flat you get a spread

410
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:29,759
but a spread width

411
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:32,240
depends on the thickness of your content

412
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:35,519
yeah you got you with me so far

413
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:40,000
so after uploading to lulu lulu tells me

414
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:43,839
the spread with should be x

415
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:46,959
now and then you go to inkscape

416
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:51,040
and you design well this is my design

417
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:55,119
effort sorry i know i shouldn't

418
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:56,399
um and clearly i have to replace this

419
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:59,120
logo

420
00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:01,759
um but this is what i came up with and

421
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:04,000
this word cloud i made with a very easy

422
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:05,439
python script script that i found online

423
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,199
because i wanted the word cloud i

424
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:10,400
thought it was fun

425
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:11,039
um oh by the way if you ever read a book

426
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,360
again

427
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:15,599
this page on the back that always says

428
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:19,039
oh this author is brilliant and this is

429
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:21,359
his masterpiece and

430
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:23,839
every author is asked by the publisher

431
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:25,760
to write that text

432
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:27,839
right so there's nothing not somebody

433
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:30,840
else the author himself

434
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:33,840
has to write all this on the

435
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,840
back

436
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:40,320
okay current status i've got 165 pages

437
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:44,000
test print 2 is out version for

438
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:45,678
computers 0.2 alpha right

439
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,080
could estimate the release date

440
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:50,640
somewhere q2 this year

441
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:51,199
and oh that's something else the book

442
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:55,520
looks

443
00:17:51,200 --> 00:18:00,240
like looks like this

444
00:17:55,520 --> 00:18:02,400
so it's got pages and pictures

445
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,760
you know if you make graphs in books you

446
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,000
know what the term is

447
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:09,039
for the for the non-tech people is

448
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,039
management porn

449
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,959
management love graphs it's a management

450
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:16,639
point

451
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:19,120
anyway so and you just order a copy

452
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:20,880
and lulu for the author it lulu tells

453
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:24,000
you

454
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:27,120
it's so many euro to print

455
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:29,840
one copy so you know what their cost is

456
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:31,039
and then you can also say what would you

457
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:34,959
think would be a fair

458
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:36,559
sales price and the difference is yours

459
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:39,039
so you make a lot more money selling

460
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:39,918
these than selling a book fire normal

461
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:42,400
publisher

462
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:44,480
maybe you sell less because now you are

463
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:46,080
in charge of the marketing

464
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,679
that's the downside but you make more

465
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:51,199
money so

466
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:54,840
maybe it evens out but it feels better

467
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:58,240
you know what i mean it feels better um

468
00:18:54,840 --> 00:19:01,360
okay and then there is the scoop

469
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:04,559
i started a hobby project so this slide

470
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:08,719
i just put in this morning

471
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:12,240
and other people who know what this is

472
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:15,919
wow one okay this is the dsky

473
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:18,640
diskey the display and the keyboard

474
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:19,200
and this used to be an apollo space

475
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:22,559

476
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:26,480

477
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:28,720
and um there are several projects online

478
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,840
currently my the 3d printer has been

479
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,960
working for a week

480
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:33,840
to make all the parts for the the

481
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:36,559
outside

482
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:37,760
there is already a project for the pcb

483
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:40,879
but

484
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:43,919
i want something different

485
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:47,039
so i i

486
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:50,559
did do some electronics in in

487
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:52,879
a bachelor level someday in the past

488
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:53,760
way back in the past so now i'm doing a

489
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:57,360
keycat

490
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:57,760
online training course to so i can learn

491
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,240
to

492
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:01,840
to design another pcb so that's my hobby

493
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,520
project

494
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:06,320
i've just registered the domain there's

495
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:09,520
no website there's no email yet working

496
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:13,600
we'll all be done tomorrow i guess

497
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:13,600
okay thanks for your attention any

498
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:21,039
[Applause]

499
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:23,120
guy who approached you in questions so

500
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:24,240
what can you tell more about the guy who

501
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:27,760
approached you in spain

502
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,760
yeah i can is the video off

503
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,799
um he

504
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:40,320
i i think he doesn't like the spotlight

505
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:42,720
once he started a business

506
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:44,080
and in selling a specific kind of

507
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,919
fertilizer

508
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:48,320
and that grew into a company in 30

509
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:50,320
countries and then he sold that

510
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:52,240
making him an instant millionaire maybe

511
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:56,158
build multi i don't know how much but

512
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:58,880
he's in there you know and um and he

513
00:20:56,159 --> 00:21:00,159
knows about open source i don't think he

514
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:03,039
programs but that's

515
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:04,559
that but he's he could be in he isn't

516
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:05,679
he's not here but he could be in the

517
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:08,240
audience you know you wouldn't

518
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:09,200
see the difference he's half nerd half

519
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:12,480
human

520
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,480
um and

521
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:17,840
he wanted uh this book to oh yeah and he

522
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,840
also

523
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:23,679
automated his whole business with odu

524
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,679
community edition

525
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:29,200
and that's why he now feels like okay i

526
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:32,320
want to he wants to

527
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,960
encourage new entrepreneurs to do what

528
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:35,280
he

529
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:37,360
basically what he learned start early

530
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:38,639
using oh do don't start with wordpress

531
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,840
for your website first because you can

532
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,520
also do that in hodo

533
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:45,840
start with your website even your

534
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:45,840
website in odoo and grow from there

535
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:48,720
yes

536
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:01,360
okay so for one it's free which is nice

537
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,400
for a startup

538
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:07,600
it has huge functionality uh

539
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:11,440
that's really at a professional level so

540
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:12,000
your income taxes uh your your invoicing

541
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:16,960
it's all

542
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:19,520
in there um you can expand on it and if

543
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,960
your business grows at some point

544
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:23,120
probably you will shift to the

545
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:26,720
enterprise edition when you have

546
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:29,840
100 or 200 people working for you but

547
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:32,240
it's with innovation and startups not

548
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:36,000
everybody will grow to that level

549
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:37,760
so you need to encourage as many people

550
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,039
as possible to start a business with a

551
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:42,080
good idea

552
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:45,280
and and a cheap piece of good software

553
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:47,840
and and see if that can grow into

554
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,840
a big business

555
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:55,440
you have to set up for next accident can

556
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:59,199
i do one okay

557
00:22:55,440 --> 00:23:01,760
uh the book content is not open source

558
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:03,120
then back to the top we can ask all the

559
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:05,360
related questions

560
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:06,320
uh for example i know i'm aware of the

561
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,918
community and the

562
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:09,840
enterprise version and for example i

563
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:11,679
start with the community version and

564
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:13,439
let's say i need one application

565
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:14,960
like the barcode scanner which is the

566
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:16,720
enterprise version

567
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,559
the enterprise versions offers

568
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:21,039
self-hosted support but they

569
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:22,000
charge for all the apps per user which

570
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:23,600
you are using

571
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,200
is there a possibility to use a

572
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:27,439
combination of

573
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:29,360
community based for most of the

574
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:31,039
application and just use the barcode

575
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:34,399
scanner from the enterprise version

576
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:36,000
it works differently so the ocad audio

577
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:38,320
community association

578
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,799
has a github repository with a huge

579
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:42,879
amount of open source add-ons

580
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:44,400
so you just have to find the correct

581
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:46,559
add-on in github

582
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,600
incorporate that into the community

583
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:49,360
edition

584
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:51,199
and then it's it's it's completely

585
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:52,080
integrated and because it's a large

586
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,240
community

587
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:55,840
okay uh do you have any comparison with

588
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:58,480
other open source free

589
00:23:55,840 --> 00:24:00,158
erp software like dollybarn xtrp or

590
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:03,360
admtr

591
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:05,600
uh being java based of course this is

592
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:08,000
python

593
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:11,199
but no i'm not a business specialist i'm

594
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,200
not a specialist at the way

595
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:19,840
okay thank you so much

596
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,600
you
