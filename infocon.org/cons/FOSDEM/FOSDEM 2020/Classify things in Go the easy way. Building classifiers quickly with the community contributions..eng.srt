00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:11,840
[Applause]

2
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,759
it's okay

3
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:19,198
okay hi i'm just

4
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:19,199
okay who i am

5
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:27,519
my name is a kinda different name and

6
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:31,119
that gif show how to

7
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:31,979
speak my name must just a low so close

8
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:35,920
it's shamey

9
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:38,960
[Laughter]

10
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:42,079
uh i'm from brazil and

11
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:45,680
nowadays i work with ai

12
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:49,600
things uh at a company

13
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:52,160
called novio and me and my team

14
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,680
use a lot of go program language to

15
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:57,839
broke up

16
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:58,480
to build things and yes i book a lot of

17
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,399
software

18
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:05,840
things and codes and we give

19
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:09,439
uh we built the software and then

20
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:11,040
we give some arch cell intelligence to

21
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:15,039
the to the hardware

22
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:18,479
we have harder to new harders

23
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:21,920
like i don't know if i can

24
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:25,439
tell about it but imagine i opting

25
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:28,880
iot new things

26
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:32,720
this is our schedule today uh

27
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:35,920
uh i you talk about introduction to

28
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:38,240
cv classifiers a challenge

29
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:40,560
for you for you and modules from

30
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:43,839
community tensorflow hub and

31
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:47,200
other open libraries why use gold cv

32
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:49,439
and not python for example and go first

33
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,439
but

34
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,040
so what does computer vision i think i

35
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,240
don't know

36
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:00,640
if she any if she everybody

37
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:02,079
knows what it is uh it's basically the

38
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,960
field inside of their

39
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:05,520
cell intelligence that trains computer

40
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,560
uh

41
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:11,920
to like computer

42
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:15,599
has have a eyes and brain like

43
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:18,000
us and can see uh so that way

44
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:18,720
the computer can see our or the human

45
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,080
world

46
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:25,359
and then uh so if we have lucky

47
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:28,879
and then then they can react

48
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:32,000
to the to the what to what

49
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:32,000
the machines see

50
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:37,280
this is my challenge a scenario uh iot

51
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,000
company

52
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,640
it's not my company i promised i

53
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,120
received

54
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:44,000
received a proposal for new clients who

55
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,640
asked for

56
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,200
10 distinct images classifiers for

57
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,000
different

58
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,480
products some classifiers will be rapid

59
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
into

60
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:56,879
api and put and connecting a kafka

61
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,720
skewer and other will grow independent

62
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:04,079
they they want 10 classifiers

63
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:07,680
you need to do a puck to show

64
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:10,800
to your company if it's viable to do it

65
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:15,200
in the terms and the time that

66
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:15,200
was proposed how you do it

67
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,840
anybody

68
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:25,680
you're the imaginary classifier from the

69
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:29,680
scratch

70
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:33,519
no wrong answer because

71
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:37,200
i imagine it you don't you don't

72
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:40,959
throw money away and i'm i'm correct

73
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:44,480
because it's hard you need to

74
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:48,080
knows math knows

75
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:52,079
how to do models

76
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:52,080
and know basically

77
00:03:54,799 --> 00:04:00,000
basically some language and it's it's

78
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:03,200
need a huge attempt to

79
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,640
do it and

80
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:09,679
how they say time is money

81
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:12,000
is the other is

82
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,720
through the community and open source

83
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,560
things like

84
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:20,000
go cv we can use

85
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:23,759
the the thing the other

86
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:26,960
people just built before

87
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:31,600
like tensorflow hub it's a source cafe

88
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:31,599
it's another source and go cv

89
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:38,240
basically the

90
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:41,759
the the tensorflow hub

91
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,400
is a library open library you can

92
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:46,720
imagine

93
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:50,159
a lot of pieces of lego blocks

94
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:53,360
uh and that that pieces are

95
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:56,000
uh trained models you and you can

96
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,199
just download that and use that and then

97
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:02,160
you can do

98
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:02,160
uh what i did is uh

99
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:10,720
a minimal modifications in the in the

100
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:15,280
files in the pb files and the text files

101
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:15,280
and like finding turning

102
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:24,080
and why go cv and

103
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:27,919
don't and why why use go cv

104
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,919
cv gives to the golfers

105
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,320
assets to the open civic computer vision

106
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,440
library because of the packages supports

107
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:36,479
the last release

108
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:38,240
of goal and obsid versus the last

109
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:42,400
version is for

110
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:45,600
on linux mac ox and windows

111
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:48,638
why is that about windows

112
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:52,400
because i i bring

113
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:56,160
a computer with windows because

114
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:59,679
i want to show uh i improve that makes

115
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:03,759
go cv and computer vision

116
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:07,360
it's accessible for everyone if you

117
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:10,960
uh if you

118
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:14,240
if you are a software engineer

119
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:15,599
or not and go see visual parts the intel

120
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,880
open window toolkit too

121
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,880
it's a very nice thing

122
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:24,400
okay shame you don't show me the code

123
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,400
because blah blah blah

124
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,080
i just

125
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:37,119
just a second are you

126
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,600
okay

127
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:49,840
how i mirrored that

128
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:17,840
and then you select oh

129
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,199
yay

130
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:34,960
this is my sheeting so

131
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:34,960
uh first start

132
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:43,520
i will run a program the

133
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:47,919
that how code we can found on the

134
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:51,198
go cv platform

135
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:54,560
and in the my last slide i put

136
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:57,680
all the the material

137
00:07:54,560 --> 00:08:01,199
so just i

138
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:04,400
just we will try

139
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:04,400
to run and

140
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,440
yeah that that that that you that that

141
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,440
um

142
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:22,719
air uh it's because windows

143
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,720
but uh how

144
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:30,000
how how it works

145
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:33,039
it's just just shoot just to

146
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:41,839
show that i can open a window

147
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:41,838
and communicate my code

148
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:58,959
that's weird

149
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:58,959
i blame the windows

150
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:08,079
there you go better yeah i blame your

151
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:11,040
windows for just

152
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,040
try i try but

153
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:25,200
so let me it's my camera

154
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:25,200
i think it might be no it's something

155
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:37,839
again okay hello

156
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:53,519
okay don't get close i i

157
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,920
how i show my code if i don't can't

158
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:02,080
touch

159
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:02,079
my notebook but it's literally like

160
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:06,959
the problem but it's the computer is

161
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,519
muted

162
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:09,518
it's foamy

163
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:19,839
sorry

164
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:35,440
thank you microsoft

165
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:35,440
uh kill it

166
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,920
okay so

167
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:49,279
i try but i i know in those hands

168
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,279
some problems like that

169
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:56,640
i i i but

170
00:10:53,040 --> 00:11:00,640
you you you saw that works works

171
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:03,439
we feel a little problem that works now

172
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:04,880
i will do very quickly the the rest of

173
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:08,160
my presentation

174
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:10,880
uh just this is this program i run

if anyone can do uh here with me

195
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:41,279

goffers there are i can i

197

wow i hope

201
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,519

202
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:19,359
works

203
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:22,800

what i told you told you before

207
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:37,200
i just uh entering

208
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:40,880
like are you sure

209
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:45,680
before in that site the tensorflow

210
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:45,680
rub you can

211
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:52,720
search here for for models

212
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:55,760
then i download that model and then i do

213
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:59,040
a fine and funny tuning and

214
00:13:55,760 --> 00:14:02,639
uh to to to the

215
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:07,760
new new classifier can require

216
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:17,839
recognize the the gopher and

217
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:17,839
we will see if it works

218
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:22,160
okay this is the

219
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:28,479
this is the the what the program

220
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,480
uh

221
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,199
i think think they see

222
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:47,360
and now you can do

223
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,359
ping pong

224
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:52,479
go for blush yay

225
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:57,279
we we need to try another another color

226
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,839
of

227
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,839
gopher

228
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:15,760
because it's pink

229
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:20,160
but i can

230
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:20,160
i can i can do

231
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:27,839
it

232
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:41,839
i lolly

233
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:45,589
[Applause]

234
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:52,440
[Music]

235
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:55,839
blushes

236
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,959
and of course that uh that that question

237
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:09,839
i

238
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:09,839
recognize on other things like water

239
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:39,680
other things like books

240
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:52,240
oh no

241
00:16:50,840 --> 00:17:05,839
[Music]

242
00:16:52,240 --> 00:17:05,839
let's try another thing

243
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:27,439
and this is the view

244
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:27,439
this is that barrier okay

245
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:36,959
this is what

246
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:38,880
we can do with the models the

247
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:43,039
pre-building modules

248
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:46,080
i obvious obvious obviously obviously

249
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:50,400
i just

250
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:53,520
download the model the model uh just

251
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:56,559
have the classification for the water

252
00:17:53,520 --> 00:18:00,160
the kaffma and i put

253
00:17:56,559 --> 00:18:02,799
another another layer

254
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:03,440
another two layers indeed the gopher

255
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:06,400
plushie

256
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,400
and they got her but

257
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:10,960
so why

258
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:15,840
back to my presentation

259
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:19,840
for who wants to learn more

260
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:29,600
go cv dot io

261
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:33,200
it's the platform we can

262
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:33,918
learn everything so about the goal cv

263
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:37,600
there

264
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:41,360
and there is a link to the github

265
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:42,559
repo tensorflow europe it's the library

266
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:46,320
i thought before

267
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:47,039
cafe it's the framework uh from computer

268
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:49,280
vision

269
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:50,240
uh it's open source too and my

270
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:54,000
presentation

271
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:54,640
are in this care code and it's just a

272
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,840
variable

273
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,840
to you can

274
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,559

team and

281
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:25,919
some some water you can do there there

282
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:29,120
is another version it's a

283
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:32,080
golfer but to uh just do it and

284

native language i try to

291
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:56,080
pass the idea here if anyone anyone can

292
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:59,840
uh build a computer vision

293
00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:04,399
softwares and models and use uh

294
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:07,520
in your in your your

295
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:12,000
academic life or

296
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:15,360
your job for fun uh

297
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:18,559
i you can download for example

298
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:21,678
uh in my my in my job we download

299
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:24,960
the the model of google to

300
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:26,559
identify sheets blank sheets and sheets

301
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:30,159
with some texts

302
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:34,320
and we we did the

303
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:39,280
final turning about it and now you use

304
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:42,080
it in my job it's another example

305
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:43,120
of course it's a burning thing so i

306
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:46,399
prefer

307
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:49,760
uh bring gophers

308
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:53,919
because show the blank sheets

309
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:54,480
and that's it uh there is a lot of

310
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:57,600
models

311
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:58,880
of car models uh pet models you can

312
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:04,158
identify

313
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:07,919
uh a lot of type of cats for example

314
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:11,679
cars counting cars it's it's it's insane

315
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:15,280
the the how much

316
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:18,159
uh how much things you can do with with

317
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:18,720
the pre-building modules it's it's like

318
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:23,120
a

319
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:25,679
lego blocks you can con build everything

320
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,678
that's it

321
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:31,840
thank you

322
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,918
