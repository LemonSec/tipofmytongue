1
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,519
um

2
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:10,719
so um yeah my name is chisco fowley i

3
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:14,080
work for tdf

4
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:16,720
i partly work for tdf part time

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:18,880
i've been in tdf for the last three

6
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:22,080
years and i do

7
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,080
mostly qa

8
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,160
it's gonna be a short talk because uh

9
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,960
when i

10
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,080
submitted it i did it as a lighting talk

11
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,800
but then

12
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:33,440
they gave me half an hour so yeah i

13
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,640
don't have

14
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:40,559
enough things to say so yeah

15
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:44,000
whatever yeah so

16
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:49,599
i want to talk about how

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,600
we try to prioritize bugs in baxilla

18
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:55,199
and in libreoffice project and

19
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:56,840
the reason i want to talk about it it's

20
00:00:55,199 --> 00:01:00,879
behi because in

21
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:03,120
baxilla well in our back tracker

22
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:04,000
this is a screenshot i i took the other

23
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,200
day

24
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,400
so you can uh put in content

25
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:13,040
uh uh how many bags

26
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,400
we deal with every day so right now we

27
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,600
have uh

28
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:20,000
72 000 bucks and

29
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:22,509
well right now some are still

30
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,840
unconfirmed needs to be triaged

31
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:28,400
[Music]

32
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:31,360
1300 thirteen thousand are new

33
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,920
and then uh fifty more than fifty

34
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:36,000
thousand

35
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:37,759
are resolved so i've used this

36
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,079
uh screenshot before in other

37
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:43,439
presentations and then when i was

38
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:46,158
working on this presentation i

39
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:46,960
thought okay let's compare it with a

40
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:52,640
previous one

41
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:55,360
so this one is uh from september 2018

42
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,399
obviously the numbers the total numbers

43
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:59,680
were less

44
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:03,040
but what surprised me was that well

45
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:05,119
uh comparing um

46
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,479
let's say one year and a half more or

47
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:09,520
less ago and

48
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:12,640
now we see that the number of

49
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:16,640
new bugs uh has increased only by

50
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:19,359
six percent but then it's um

51
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,319
interesting to see that uh well the

52
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:23,520
number of

53
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:25,040
resolve bugs increased by 16 percent and

54
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:28,400
then the verified

55
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:32,000
uh 68 and then the total

56
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:35,120
16 which is in line with the number of

57
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,319
resolve backs so yeah it was interesting

58
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,360
to me to see

59
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:41,760
um how the new bugs are not

60
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:44,000
increasing that much but yeah back to

61
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,959
the back to the topic of uh prioritizing

62
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,319
bugs

63
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:52,560
um so

64
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:57,359
oh there's a wait

65
00:02:52,560 --> 00:03:02,000
um i think this is not the sorry

66
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:02,000
i'm using that sorry

67
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:07,040
i think i'm using the wrong

68
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:19,840
sorry for that

69
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,879
um

70
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:36,239
oh yeah sorry i was using the the wrong

71
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,920
file

72
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:43,519
so um in baxilla we have

73
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:47,518
this uh five categories of uh

74
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:50,560
or levels of priorities in

75
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:53,760
in bugs so

76
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:58,080
high guest or p0 could be

77
00:03:53,760 --> 00:04:01,200
crash loss data inability to install

78
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:04,159
and what is important to me is that uh

79
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,119
well it affects all or nearly all users

80
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:08,239
and documents

81
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:11,439
therefore um we also have high

82
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:13,200
uh high severity high priority category

83
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:15,280
and it's

84
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,639
it's not as important as highest but

85
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,358
then as with

86
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:20,639
serious problems and with open certain

87
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:23,758
documents and then

88
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:25,520
tedious is slow and affects many uses

89
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:27,600
and then we also have these three

90
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:30,719
categories normally when

91
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:33,040
a bug is reported in general it just

92
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:35,680
goes to medium and then

93
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:37,199
in a few cases it just goes to low or

94
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:41,440
lowest

95
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:45,120
yeah so this is from or

96
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:48,160
wiki page and

97
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:51,759
this is uh the usual

98
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:55,600
uh flow uh when someone

99
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:59,440
it's a triage in a bug

100
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:02,560
normally we try to follow this

101
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:05,199
so i don't know if you can read it but

102
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:07,280
uh let's say you are triaging a bug

103
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:07,919
first thing you have to ask yourself is

104
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,320
uh

105
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:11,919
it's a crash it's losing the data

106
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:17,120
inability to install

107
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:20,000
then if it's yes then you should um

108
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:22,240
well you should ask these questions like

109
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:27,360
it's a

110
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:31,360
i can read it wait i can

111
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:34,800
yeah so basically

112
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:38,560
you can uh you can ask you

113
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:41,199
you can ask yourself does this back a

114
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:43,280
happened very frequently does this bug

115
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:45,440
involve major components

116
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:47,198
or does it affect components that affect

117
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:50,160
many users

118
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:51,360
so basically this is the the way you

119
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:55,280
video is not working

120
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:57,039
it seems it's not even recording

121
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,638
um i don't know but people on the

122
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:01,520
internet said that it's not

123
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:03,039
uh maybe it's recording but not uh

124
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,719
broadcasting

125
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:06,639
i don't know about that but that's it

126
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:09,120
says recording there

127
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:10,000
it's flashing and that's on your screen

128
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,840
isn't it

129
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,639
i think it's all right i don't know

130
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:18,880
about broadcasting why i don't know

131
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:18,880
let me check it has a green light

132
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,479
yeah yeah but you can see it's coming

133
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,800
down here

134
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:25,919
yeah because this feeds into the pods

135
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,639
anything but the custom

136
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:29,440
box has the flashing red recording light

137
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:34,400
so

138
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:38,479
i think it's fine okay people say so

139
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:42,080
yeah so this is uh

140
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:45,120
basically the float uh the workflow

141
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:48,880
we have been using in qa

142
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:53,039
since the other the project started

143
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:56,159
um so then i wanted to

144
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:59,120
analyze like how the progress of

145
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,680
highest priority issues went in the last

146
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,639
years

147
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,599
so this is from the last five years and

148
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:07,120
then

149
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:07,599
back in the time it was it was around 80

150
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,960
and

151
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:14,159
yeah 80 highest priority issues

152
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:17,359
in baxilla so then we found

153
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:21,280
we found out that uh people

154
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:23,840
uh normal users they were increasing the

155
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,880
priority of of those bugs and then we

156
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:28,000
had really

157
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:31,599
high high number of uh priority bugs so

158
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:34,800
at this point we decided to create a

159
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:38,159
contributor group a contributor group a

160
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:39,039
group sorry and then we see that from

161
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:43,199
there

162
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:46,639
the number of uh highest ability back

163
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:50,080
went down so at this time uh

164
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:53,280
right now it's around 20 so the trend

165
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:56,318
it's uh going well so it should be

166
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:57,520
ideally to be zero but at least the

167
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:01,440
trend shows that

168
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:04,878
um yeah it's going down so sometimes

169
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:07,520
uh when um

170
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:09,120
when we are triaging bugs it's easy to

171
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:12,318
find that it's a crush

172
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,039
or it's a data loss but we don't really

173
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:15,680
know

174
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:17,599
or we didn't know how many users were

175
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:21,520
affected by this bug

176
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:24,000
so we here we have an example

177
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:25,120
in the ese meeting uh easy meeting is a

178
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,639
meeting we do

179
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:32,479
weekly developers uxqa

180
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:32,479
documentation everyone in the project is

181
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,799
participating in this meeting so we have

182
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:39,919
a section for

183
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:41,519
qa and then we just say okay these are

184
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:45,279
these are the most pressing back

185
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:48,399
or highest priority bugs so

186
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:52,399
sometimes we found for instance

187
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:55,600
this issue here which at first glance

188
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:58,880
doesn't look like a crash or

189
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:00,720
it doesn't look like uh data loss or

190
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:03,760
it's not affected installation

191
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:08,320
but that then we found that many users

192
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:12,319
were affected by this issue so if

193
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:15,040
i open it in in vaxilla

194
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,040
i see that

195
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:21,120
we have many people in cc

196
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,319
which means they are kind of interested

197
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,920
in this issue

198
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:29,680
and also we we had many

199
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:32,079
duplicates for this issue so

200
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,959
that means that we got many reports in

201
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,720
baxilla

202
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:36,880
complaining about this issue this this

203
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:40,720
was for 6.3

204
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:40,720
release a half a year and ago

205
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,719
so yeah as i said uh when you look at

206
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:47,760
this

207
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,320
at this back you think it's not at fair

208
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,120
glance

209
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,680
do you think it's not a higher stability

210
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,920
back or

211
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:55,199
highest priority back but then

212
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,760
considering the number of

213
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,880
uh duplicates and the number of people

214
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:02,160
in cc

215
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:06,240
uh yeah we decided to to put it in

216
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:09,279
as a high gas ability back

217
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:13,600
so um recently

218
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:16,720
we are also using this uh apart from the

219
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:18,000
flow flow chart i saw you before we are

220
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:22,160
also using this kind of

221
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:25,040
uh rules so uh basically we can have

222
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:26,160
two kind of issues or two kind of

223
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,880
tickets in baxilla

224
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:30,160
uh either they are bugs or they are uh

225
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:33,439
enhancements

226
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:36,800
so if we check if it's a bug

227
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,200
then we see if there are more than uh 20

228
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,800
people

229
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:43,680
in the cc list or we have more than five

230
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:45,199
duplicates and then if it's a regression

231
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:47,439
that we say okay this is a

232
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:49,040
high gas stability bug and if it's not a

233
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:51,200
regression then we say it's a

234
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,319
high it's a very good debug and then for

235
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,600
enhancements

236
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:57,440
uh we say that if there are more than uh

237
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:00,000
20 people in cc and more than five

238
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:03,440
duplicates then it's a high severity

239
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:06,560
enhancement when i was doing

240
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:09,040
uh well i started to use this uh

241
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:10,239
these rules recently and then i found

242
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:14,000
that many

243
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:16,720
enhancements were put to highest

244
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,640
and yeah in my opinion it doesn't make

245
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:21,440
sense because

246
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,920
yeah it's true that an enhancement can

247
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,279
be

248
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:27,760
reported many times and

249
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:28,560
yeah some people or many people would

250
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,640
many of

251
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:33,359
our users would like to have it but it

252
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:35,120
doesn't mean it's really urgent to be

253
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,880
fixed that's why it doesn't make sense

254
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:40,160
to have a high gas priority

255
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:44,079
enhancement so um after

256
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:47,760
digging this cleanup we found that

257
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:51,359
uh well we we were around 16

258
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:54,639
and then we have we found some old

259
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:57,839
bugs that weren't uh

260
00:11:54,639 --> 00:12:01,600
tucked as high as priority back so now

261
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:04,000
they are kind of more important and

262
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,800
they need they have more priority uh to

263
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,079
be fixed in

264
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:10,399
in in the list of issues

265
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:11,599
and then in the easy meeting we started

266
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:14,320
to

267
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,200
track the high priority issues as well

268
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:19,279
so now

269
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:23,680
every week we see which issues are

270
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:26,720
turned into high stability back as well

271
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:27,359
so yeah this way what we can do what we

272
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,079
see

273
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:31,920
is that uh we are having the same trend

274
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:35,040
with a high stability box or

275
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:36,079
high priority bugs so then uh in five

276
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:39,120
years ago

277
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:41,760
it went up to uh 600

278
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,519
now it's going at this point it was

279
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,760
around

280
00:12:42,519 --> 00:12:48,720
460 then here is when i did the

281
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:49,760
this all clean up and now it's around

282
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,880
400

283
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:54,079
so yeah the trend is showing that we are

284
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:57,200
going in the

285
00:12:54,079 --> 00:13:01,279
right direction there is still a long

286
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:05,600
uh way to go but uh yeah it seems that

287
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:08,800
we are getting there it's a long process

288
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:10,000
uh so this is uh from last two months

289
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,959
more or less

290
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,680
so we see that here when we did this

291
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:17,000
cleanup

292
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:21,120
it went from 460 to

293
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:23,519
380 and now it's around 400

294
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:25,920
and now this is the current status uh

295
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:30,320
highest priority box it's a 22

296
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:34,319
and a high priority box 398.

297
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:37,360
and yeah we have also this

298
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:40,160
wiki page which might

299
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:41,199
be interesting to track this kind of

300
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:44,560
issues

301
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:48,639
so we have a page in bachelor for a

302
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:53,920
stats and here we can see

303
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:56,480
for instance delay the list of uh

304
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,760
regressions by number of people in cc

305
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:00,240
and here

306
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:01,680
the list of regressions uh by number of

307
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:05,519
duplicates

308
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:09,120
so for instance we see

309
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:12,320
that right now

310
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:14,800
the open regression which is

311
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,440
interesting or it's affecting more

312
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,000
people

313
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,800
based on people on number of people in

314
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,040
cc

315
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:26,079
is the funds getting blur

316
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:29,360
in macos and then same for

317
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:31,599
number of duplicates we have the same

318
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:36,160
problem

319
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:39,199
mac os both regarding phones

320
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:42,800
those are right now the most

321
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:45,839
well based on what users report

322
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:48,000
and what users are interested in

323
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:49,519
right now these are the two most

324
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,639
pressing bugs

325
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:54,720
that should be fixed and as soon as

326
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:58,639
possible

327
00:14:54,720 --> 00:15:02,000
problem is that it's not that trivial or

328
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:02,560
no one it's really interested to fix it

329
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,600
so

330
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:10,160
i hope that tdf

331
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:14,079
contender these problems to be fixed

332
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:17,680
this year so that's my hope and i'm

333
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:20,959
putting some pressure there and yeah

334
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:27,839
that's uh basically it so thank you

335
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:27,839
and do you have any questions

336
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:41,839
you mean number of visits and

337
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:49,120
i've never used it

338
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:54,639
so i have no idea maybe

339
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:57,600
maybe if we don't have it we can

340
00:15:54,639 --> 00:16:01,920
integrate it and then have more

341
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:04,560
uh input in there but i don't know

342
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:05,279
if we haven't if you don't know i do

343
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:08,560
mean that

344
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:09,759
so it could be an interesting source as

345
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:13,439
well

346
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:23,199
yeah to see what people look for and

347
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:25,680
uh-huh okay yeah

348
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:27,279
developers who write features or is

349
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:30,479
there a specific group of

350
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:34,000
developers fixing blocks so

351
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:37,680
tdf per se doesn't have developers

352
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:40,720
or paid developers so we are based on

353
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:44,800
contributors or affiliated

354
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:44,800
companies cib

355
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,720
collabora or others or needs from

356
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:52,880
hungary

357
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:55,839
hungarian government and others so

358
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:56,720
basically the way it works in my

359
00:16:55,839 --> 00:17:00,480
experience

360
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:04,640
is that if an issue or

361
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:05,599
a bug it's a regression then we normally

362
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,400
bisect this

363
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:09,280
regression we find the commit where the

364
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:12,319
regression was

365
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:15,839
introduced and then

366
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:19,520
qa like i do that and

367
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:21,359
a qa team do that so

368
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:22,799
if we have a regression and we have a

369
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:25,599
commit

370
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:26,559
showing where the problem get got

371
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:29,918
introduced

372
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:33,120
then uh well it's we kindly ask

373
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:36,960
the developer to fix it and

374
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:39,520
in most of the cases they fix it

375
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:41,200
so once we have that commit then

376
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:45,200
everything gets uh

377
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:48,960
um speed up and yeah gets fixed

378
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:53,440
quite soon if the

379
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:55,919
issue is not fixed or it's let's say a

380
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,559
long-standing issue that no one is

381
00:17:55,919 --> 00:18:00,080
really

382
00:17:56,559 --> 00:18:03,600
taking care of then uh well for

383
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:06,639
this kind of issues like this mac uh

384
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:08,320
problem we have with with funds the

385
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,160
problem here is that it's not a

386
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,120
regression in libreoffice but it's a

387
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:14,799
regression

388
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:15,439
in xcode that where now the rendering is

389
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:18,240
different

390
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,880
so we have to let's say change the code

391
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,919
to

392
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:25,120
work uh properly with this

393
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:28,640
version of his code so in that case

394
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:31,760
uh well if no one is fixing that

395
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:34,799
we should find other alternative and

396
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:40,000
right now one alternative is to

397
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:44,960
propose tdf to tender that that fix

398
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,960
or find someone to to fix it but

399
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:57,840
so that's it okay

400
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:57,840
thank you thank you

401
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,439
you
