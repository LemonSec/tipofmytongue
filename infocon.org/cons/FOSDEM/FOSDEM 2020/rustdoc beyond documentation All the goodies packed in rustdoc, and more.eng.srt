1
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:07,680
so as said

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:09,599
you will have to use a lot of your

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,920
imagination and when i say things just

4
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:11,920
uh

5
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:13,040
well try to have it in your mind or

6
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,559
something

7
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,239
so it will be a result beyond

8
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:19,359
documentation you can

9
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:21,919
enjoy it so

10
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:24,320
first why am i here so i'm the rest dog

11
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:26,160
team leader since uh recently

12
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,760
i'm also part of the documentation team

13
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,119
the docs doterra's team and the dev

14
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,920
tools team so you

15
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:33,440
kind of see some kind of pattern i think

16
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,640
i think

17
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:39,920
so we started working on rest in

18
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,960
2015 i think so since then a lot of

19
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,320
things that happened

20
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:46,960
so and uh my main focus currently

21
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,239
is resdock and more globally

22
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,960
documentation so

23
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:51,519
i have to work on docs.rs and a bit

24
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,320
everything

25
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:57,360
that's related so i tried to show how we

26
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:59,760
were able to provide documentation

27
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:02,000
and most things that we have which are

28
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:05,438
pretty nice now

29
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,560
so first what is a razak so rose dock

30
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:09,119
is a tool provided alongside the

31
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,600
compiler

32
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:13,040
and cargo which is used to generate a

33
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:16,559
documentation as you may

34
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:20,159
guess you can

35
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:23,600
do a bit more but we'll go back to that

36
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:25,980
later on i think

37
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:30,419
it's kind of almost

38
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:30,420
[Laughter]

39
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:35,520
yeah as you can you really have to mind

40
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,199
it but you have

41
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,039
you can use it a multiple way like

42
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,159
directly throughout dock and you give it

43
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,320
a file and it

44
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:43,439
works but when you start having

45
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,439
dependencies

46
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:47,199
it's getting a bit tricky and the

47
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:52,079
command line is getting

48
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:52,079
quite long so welcome back to make file

49
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,840
era

50
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:09,840
it's blinking blinking

51
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:20,080
okay

52
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:21,760
[Applause]

53
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,800
yeah so now you can stop having in your

54
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:26,799
mind just read so like i was saying

55
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:29,120
you can use it directly through the

56
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,640
command line or you can use cargo dock

57
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,040
which

58
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,160
is making things much simpler so you

59
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,599
don't have to mind

60
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,440
about all the dependencies and

61
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:39,599
everything you just cargo dock and the

62
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,440
everything is done uh in the background

63
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:44,480
and it's pretty nice

64
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,879
and you can even have your web browser

65
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,959
open

66
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:48,000
and going to your page to your

67
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:50,879
documentation just

68
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,440
add the dash open and that's pretty much

69
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,720
it

70
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,720
it's very convenient

71
00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:02,640
so yeah fun fact that's something we

72
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:06,080
use the for some who don't know it

73
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:07,760
we have error indexes and you can uh

74
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,440
well we needed to have something to

75
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:12,079
generate a magnum page

76
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:13,280
so resdock can actually render and

77
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:16,319
convert

78
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,840
magdon from two html so if

79
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:20,799
at some point you need a converter it

80
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,800
works pretty well

81
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,920
so documenting we tried to focus on

82
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:29,679
having documentation done

83
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:31,599
as much inside the

84
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,840
the code as possible because in most

85
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:34,959
languages the documentation and the code

86
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,680
is generally

87
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:39,920
splitted and you have to rely on two

88
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:42,879
users that are not official

89
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,518
unless we had the look that some people

90
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:46,480
came in

91
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:47,440
pretty early just took the compiler ast

92
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,640
and converted it

93
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:53,680
into a html so to do so

94
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,238
you can have the document the documents

95
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:58,480
like that

96
00:03:54,239 --> 00:04:01,519
so slash dash no not dash

97
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:04,640
bang exactly action

98
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:07,760
exclamation mark mark sorry is

99
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:11,119
to document the current module and

100
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:13,679
if you just put a slash it's to document

101
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,560
the following item so in here it will be

102
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,560
the function

103
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,079
and the previous one will be for the

104
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,000
current module and

105
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:23,680
consider daring as we are at the top

106
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:26,960
level it will be the crater itself

107
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:29,360
and that is actually syntax

108
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,960
syntactic sugar so normally you have to

109
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:34,160
write this

110
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:37,680
which is the same but a lot less sexy

111
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:39,520
let's say it like that but

112
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,320
if you want to do treating things with

113
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:44,240
the documents you will have to use it

114
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:46,800
so most people don't really care about

115
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:50,160
that and it's fine

116
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:53,120
so yeah actually resdock is

117
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,639
very nice too to discover things that

118
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,880
are implemented on your types

119
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:58,800
through your dependencies it's notably

120
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,759
the blanket implementations so when you

121
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,919
have

122
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:03,280
you implement the trait on a generic

123
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:06,400
type so for instance

124
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:09,440
you implement a full trait on

125
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:11,599
every type implementing debug then

126
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:13,759
obviously all the types you will declare

127
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:16,400
that implement debug will have it but

128
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:18,000
unless you actually know that in your

129
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,000
dependencies you have one

130
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,120
doing that you won't be able to see it

131
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,240
and rest docs

132
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:26,880
come in and provide this those blanket

133
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,639
implementations it was actually added

134
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:31,199
very recently because

135
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,840
we had to target directly uh the

136
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:34,960
internal

137
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:36,239
compiler virtual machine which was it

138
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:39,359
was crazy time

139
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:41,840
and that works pretty well now and

140
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,479
we have also the auto trades so for

141
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:46,560
instance

142
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:48,880
send and sync the a few more but let's

143
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,639
remain on those two so if you have a

144
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:54,479
primitive types

145
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:56,240
there will be uh at least a sinkhole

146
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:57,520
one of them will be implemented and you

147
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,000
will see it directly

148
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:02,318
in the documentation you don't have to

149
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,639
go through your code and just testing

150
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:05,440
you can see it which is again very

151
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:09,840
convenient

152
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:13,039
and you it allows you to prevent a

153
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:15,758
time loss so

154
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:16,639
again to help you on your documentation

155
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:19,360
uh rosdoc

156
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:20,800
added the same lint systems that roster

157
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:24,319
has so now you can

158
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:27,199
use directly links in rest dock

159
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:27,919
and by default they are just warnings

160
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:30,960
but

161
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:34,000
you can adjust deny everything in case

162
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:37,758
you want to to provide a framework it's

163
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:40,000
actually very useful and

164
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:41,199
the first one is in case you have an

165
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,440
item module

166
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:44,479
function structure everything that is

167
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:47,280
lacking a

168
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:47,680
documentation and the second one is in

169
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,080
case

170
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,520
you like a cod example inside your doc

171
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,359
comment which is

172
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,680
something that i'm trying to enforce

173
00:06:53,360 --> 00:07:00,000
through all the documentation

174
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:00,000
so far not so good we'll see later

175
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:06,000
yeah so now beyond documentation so

176
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:08,800
actually when you provide and write a

177
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,880
code example inside your documentation

178
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:13,360
they are tested when they when you run a

179
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:17,280
rest doc so for instance in here

180
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:19,520
if you run cargo test cargo again

181
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:21,599
all the docker the code example the

182
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:24,479
inside will be run so in here

183
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:25,759
you will have a you're called failing in

184
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:28,800
case you run it but

185
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:31,599
since you have the no run

186
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,639
tag on your code example it will be not

187
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:36,479
not one just

188
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:39,280
tested as does it compile but

189
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:41,280
it's tested thanks to that you can

190
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:44,960
actually have a lot less

191
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:47,280
of all the how to say

192
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,400
api test to be sure that uh everything

193
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,159
is up to date

194
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,440
and at the same time you can provide

195
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:55,120
documentation so

196
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:57,919
it's a big time you earn a lot of time

197
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:59,680
once again very convenient and that's

198
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:03,120
something that we worked

199
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:04,000
on a lot lately you have a lot more

200
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,560
comments

201
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,240
and tags that you can use on the code

202
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,479
example so i will come back to this a

203
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,720
bit later

204
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:14,400
so like i said when you want to run dog

205
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,800
test if you want to run

206
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,840
specifically the doctors you just cargo

207
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,639
test dash dash

208
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:22,400
dock and only the dock test will be run

209
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:24,800
if you run cargo test it will be

210
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,159
also the all the test actually

211
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:30,639
everything marked as a

212
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:30,639
shebang parent and a test

213
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:37,679
so like i said we you have more tags

214
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:39,039
so you can in case you have you are

215
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:41,279
currently writing

216
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:42,240
the code your code their api isn't

217
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:45,519
stable yet

218
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:48,800
you can use the autofill which

219
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:50,080
allow you to fail obviously if you want

220
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,319
to be

221
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,120
if you are writing a proc macro or micro

222
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,920
you can use

223
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,959
file to check that some some code is

224
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,439
specifically

225
00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:00,560
failing which once again is very

226
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,959
convenient in case

227
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,399
you wanted to provide some nice errors

228
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:07,199
to the users

229
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:07,760
and well with the rising as the rest

230
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:11,120
additions

231
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:12,240
we had to handle that as well in the

232
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,560
rest so

233
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,720
you can specify i don't want to support

234
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,199
the i don't want it to be tested into

235
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,320
the

236
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:23,360
last edition so put it into the 2015.

237
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:25,040
that's fine you can ignore because you

238
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,959
don't want it to be tested or anything

239
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:29,120
you just want to have it

240
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:31,199
and to be noted that actually compile

241
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,399
fail and ignore are marked into the

242
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,560
documentation as such

243
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:35,440
so the compile file is marked with a big

244
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,760
red running

245
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,880
like it's supposed to fail and ignore

246
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:41,279
it's just like

247
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,399
it's not rain so and it takes you know

248
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:44,720
whatever

249
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:46,080
so norway doesn't ruin the test but it

250
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,399
compiles it

251
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:50,000
it's very convenient when you have io

252
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:53,600
for instance

253
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,640
uh the rest one actually isn't mandatory

254
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,680
at all but

255
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:59,839
it's always nice to specify that uh

256
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,719
it's a rest code block but like i said

257
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:04,480
by default

258
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:07,440
if not specified it will be rest so it's

259
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:08,160
not very useful in itself and the shoot

260
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,120
panic is

261
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:12,399
actually in case you run you want it to

262
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:15,519
panic

263
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:18,000
if you don't panic it's a failure

264
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:20,240
and everything else like for instance if

265
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,200
you have a blocker with a markdown text

266
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,600
or everything

267
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,399
it will be interpreted as another

268
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,720
language uh

269
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:27,920
string so if your language is called the

270
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:31,360
should panic

271
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:34,079
will have an issue besides besides that

272
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,079
it will be fine

273
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:41,839
but uh that's not uh all right so

274
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:44,320
we i worked a lot on making a

275
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:46,399
rest docker work with uh no javascript

276
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:49,040
so if you don't have javascript

277
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:50,000
you will have a very not so good looking

278
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,760
page

279
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,920
rendering but you will have it

280
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:56,959
everything will be available

281
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,439
it will work the search so you can

282
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:59,920
search

283
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,959
through the rest documentation of your

284
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,560
crate

285
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:04,319
it doesn't require an internet

286
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:07,439
connection it works

287
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,079
locally it's a javascript the downside

288
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,760
is that we

289
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:14,560
have a pretty big search index

290
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,279
but at least it works without internet

291
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,839
so if you

292
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:19,839
don't have javascript enabled it won't

293
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:21,839
work obviously

294
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:23,200
like i said you don't need the internet

295
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:28,000
connection

296
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:30,079
which is something i'm really strongly

297
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,040
enforcing because a lot of people would

298
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:33,680
like to

299
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:35,120
have for instance external search with

300
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:38,719
the pro and cons

301
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:42,000
everything and some more javascript

302
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,800
bigger like ember frameworks it's a

303
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,240
debater

304
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:49,040
in going you have a source code viewer

305
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:50,560
and i will go back a bit on this one

306
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,800
later

307
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,680
for now it's pretty simple i'm starting

308
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:57,279
to make it

309
00:11:53,680 --> 00:12:01,120
more nice and user friendly

310
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:03,680
and the goal here is mostly to

311
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:05,600
allow people to have a direct mapping on

312
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:08,079
the ucl function you can click on

313
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,360
src you will go to the definition and

314
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:10,560
you can see how it's actually

315
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:14,160
implemented

316
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:17,119
uh now you act also have the whole

317
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:19,120
file uh tree and everything so you can

318
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,480
go through the files and everything so

319
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,160
what i was thinking about the source

320
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,079
code viewer was that

321
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:26,000
currently it's very simple you just have

322
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:28,319
a syntax highlighting

323
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,040
and it'd be nice to be able for instance

324
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,959
when you hover

325
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,560
type to be able to see where it's used

326
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:35,040
and where it's defined

327
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:36,800
uh it remains to be done and we have a

328
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:38,160
lot of debates on how it should look

329
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:41,120
like and

330
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:42,240
a lot of things have to be still

331
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,240
determined

332
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,680
we're not so sure yet how it will be

333
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:48,320
looked like but

334
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:49,680
a lot of things are going uh there in uh

335
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,160
not so long

336
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:53,839
and so i say i was saying the settings

337
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:56,719
too

338
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:58,000
the settings allow you to have a more

339
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,880
precise

340
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,519
exp browsing experience so for instance

341
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,480
some people

342
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:05,680
asked for the first element when you

343
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:08,880
have a search with only

344
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:10,000
one result they wanted to go it was

345
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,720
called

346
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,399
get lucky or something and if you have

347
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,959
only one result it will go to this

348
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:17,760
result

349
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:19,359
without any search page rendering and

350
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:21,839
editing

351
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,720
again they earn time like that i'm not

352
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:26,000
so sure

353
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,880
but whatever a lot of people were

354
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,160
complaining that

355
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:33,200
the types definition when it's available

356
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:35,439
was collapsed by default we

357
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:38,240
now allow people to pick exactly which

358
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:42,320
type they want it to be collapsed or not

359
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:45,120
and a lot of other settings are there

360
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:47,519
and mostly the settings the settings

361
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:51,440
appear when we have a huge debate

362
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:53,920
with not so much people taking

363
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:55,920
one side's precisely when we don't know

364
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,959
really if people want it by default or

365
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,560
not so we just

366
00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:00,560
make a new setting and that's pretty

367
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:02,239
much it

368
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,760
something i was pushing for a long time

369
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:06,880
the sims

370
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:08,959
were married a few a few years ago and

371
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:13,519
now you can actually add your own theme

372
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:16,638
which is pretty convenient and

373
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:18,880
you have some rules to follow like

374
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:20,480
you have to implement all the css rules

375
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:22,880
as they have

376
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,760
otherwise you won't be able to add it

377
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:26,639
and it will be

378
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:28,800
just an error at the compile item but

379
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:32,240
you can under your own things it's

380
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:33,439
pretty simple and as most feature at

381
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:36,240
some point i should write the

382
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:39,199
documentation on how to actually do it

383
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,680
but that's it and customizable actually

384
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:42,079
you can

385
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:44,160
pretty much change everything through

386
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:44,880
the command line adding your own style

387
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:48,399
files on

388
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:51,519
css javascript html even if you want

389
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:54,959
and i don't know if people know the

390
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:56,560
ponies create on docs.terrace but

391
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:58,079
at some point you should take a look

392
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:01,920
it's interesting

393
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:05,760
let's say that and the goal of this

394
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:07,760
was as the origin to be able

395
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:09,040
to allow to have more specific

396
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:11,519
experience

397
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:12,079
everything that users might want for

398
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:13,760
instance

399
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:17,120
if you wanted your documentation to look

400
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:19,519
more like a book than the documentation

401
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:20,480
we didn't see much people actually use

402
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:22,639
it

403
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,839
except of course as a standard library

404
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:27,040
and stuff that i'm

405
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:30,240
doing myself so at some point yeah

406
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:32,800
i think what the likes there is a

407
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,279
once again documentation which is kind

408
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,639
of

409
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:38,720
ironic so

410
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:40,240
yeah very quickly what's coming next so

411
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:43,040
like i said more interactive

412
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:45,279
source code viewer the automatic click

413
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:47,599
generation based on the type name for

414
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:49,439
answer for instance you just put a

415
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:51,519
string and it will uh

416
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:53,759
render the link for the string you don't

417
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:56,240
have to do it yourself anymore

418
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:58,000
more output formats supported so that's

419
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:01,759
this comes from

420
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:04,880
people were debating about how the

421
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:09,040
pager should look like and to fix

422
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:12,160
this issue i was i proposed to generate

423
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:15,199
json as well as the html

424
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:16,480
so it's ongoing and it's taking a lot of

425
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:18,719
time

426
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:20,160
we now have a conditional condition

427
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,639
documentation so you can

428
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,199
just say if i'm on this platform i don't

429
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:26,399
want

430
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:27,680
this thing to be a documentary for some

431
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:31,360
reason

432
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:34,160
and now the problem is on cargo

433
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:35,519
and i need to go back on this later and

434
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:38,959
with the dock areas

435
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:40,480
which is for now only used on the std

436
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:42,319
library so for instance if you're

437
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:44,959
looking for the

438
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,839
upper hand you will have the reference

439
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:50,000
page

440
00:16:45,839 --> 00:17:04,639
which will be returned in the search

441
00:16:50,000 --> 00:17:04,638
yeah so you see perfect
