we are now on to our next presentation

3
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:12,480
the ethics of open source a critical

4
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,840
reflection

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,920

like to gesticulate and i don't know how

15
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,880
to

16
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,879

so uh my name is don goodman wilson i

20
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:51,280
used to do philosophy i also used to do

21
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:52,640
computer programming type things i used

22
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,360
to do community

23
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,640
uh i have a consultancy that's lovely

24
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,480
and i want to talk about

25
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,359
some news items that have come up in

26
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:03,199
just the past couple of weeks

27
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:05,680
just two days ago news about a firm

28
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:07,439
called practice fusion broke

29
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,680
uh has anybody heard about that one

30
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:11,360
practice fusion was a software for for

31
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:14,960
doctors to help them

32
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:18,640
diagnose medical conditions that also

33
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:19,600
suggested opioids far more frequently

34
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,520
than necessary

35
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,919
at the request of the manufacturer of

36
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:26,960
the opioids

37
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,560
the us air force uh has a new game you

38
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,000
can play online where you can train to

39
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,119
be a drone pilot and practice killing

40
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,479
people and if you enjoy it

41
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:34,400
they're happy to hire you because it's a

42
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:36,640
recruiting tool

43
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,240
news broker brought clearview new york

44
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:41,200
times about two weeks ago

45
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:43,039
company that uh uses facial recognition

46
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,119
technology to identify people from

47
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:48,000
pictures that they've posted to their

48
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:48,720
uh public news feeds twitter and so

49
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,720
forth it's

50
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:53,200
apparently surprisingly effective not

51
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:56,000
only identifying the person but showing

52
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,439
where they are on twitter and vinmo and

53
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,799
other tools like this

54
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:00,880
and although i can't prove it about

55
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,399
clearview um

56
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:06,000
we can inferred about the rust these are

57
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:10,720
all powered by open source software

58
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,720
um which is a little scary um

59
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,000
and i think over the past six months

60
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:16,640
there's been an increased awareness that

61
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,120
open source software is helping to fuel

62
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,238
um injustice in the world what's

63
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,080
particularly interesting about these

64
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:24,319
examples is it's not just

65
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,920
us who create the software who are

66
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:27,839
impacted by this it's not just those who

67
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,359
are consuming and using the software

68
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,120
uh that are impacted it is actually

69
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,480
disproportionately people

70
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,120
none of us have any relationship with

71
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:36,640
whatsoever uh who are being impacted by

72
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,640
this the people who are being

73
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,640
uh terrorized by the us air force the

74
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,839
people who are being prescribed opioids

75
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,760
when they don't need them

76
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,879
the people uh who would rather not have

77
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:47,200
their privacy

78
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:49,120
violated uh using the software that we

79
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,200
create

80
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,120
um there's been a number of attempts at

81
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:55,040
addressing this sort of thing recently

82
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,560
um this is uh from the hippocratic

83
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:59,359
license by uh coraline

84
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,800
at mk uh which essentially takes an mit

85
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,200
stylizes and adds this

86
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,000
no harm clause to it uh that the

87
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,640
software

88
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,040
uh may not be used uh in activities that

89
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,799
uh

90
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,480
violate human rights as defined by the

91
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:13,360
united nations

92
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,159
um and i think experiments like this are

93
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,080
laudable

94
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:17,519
right i think the time is right for us

95
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,599
to start thinking about these sorts of

96
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,040
experimentations

97
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:22,399
but the response from the open source

98
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,200
community at large has not been very

99
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,680
positive

100
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:28,640
so we see things like licenses should

101
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,640
not be political

102
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:35,680
it's not open source

103
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,360
it's not probably like i'm willing to

104
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,000
accept that as a claim

105
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:42,480
but this is also not an argument right

106
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,159
this is called begging the question

107
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,560
i really want to dig into this in this

108
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:48,319
talk why is the response so frequently

109
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,080
it's not open source and why does this

110
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:50,720
claim carry so much weight in our

111
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,640
community

112
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:56,080
because it does even the osi themselves

113
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,760
right they weighed in on this um i

114
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,879
removed the the slide here because i've

115
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,079
only got 20 minutes

116
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:02,079
and i sort of have to power through the

117
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,519
argument that i want to make but the osi

118
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,879
has been quite clear no this is not open

119
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:06,560
source

120
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:09,760
and then you know refers people to this

121
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:11,439
faq on the opensource.org website can i

122
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:15,679
stop evil people from using

123
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:18,719
my program uh no because

124
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:20,639
that's not what open is right that's

125
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:24,720
sort of the opposite of open

126
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:27,680
and i just feel this tension and i can't

127
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:29,280
help but think we have ended up

128
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:32,400
somewhere

129
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:33,919
really bad right

130
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,679
what is this tension that i'm feeling

131
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:37,520
why do i feel bad about this why does

132
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,320
this strike me and hopefully it strikes

133
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,960
some of you

134
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,840
as uh as absurd i want to dig into this

135
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,799
question i want to get into this

136
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:46,080
question a lot

137
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:48,160
right uh so how did we get here

138
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,120
where did this come from how do we move

139
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,520
forward from here

140
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,800
and in particular why do we hold the

141
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:55,440
word open

142
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,560
or the concept of open in such high

143
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,919
esteem

144
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,000
why is the appeal to the fact that

145
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:01,440
something is not open source used as a

146
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,520
conversation stopper

147
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:05,520
right as the final and ultimate argument

148
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:08,960
why we should stop pursuing

149
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,960
these sorts of explorations

150
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:13,840
and i find this very curious actually um

151
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,120
and i want to dig into the history a

152
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:18,560
little bit

153
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,560
i did not touch that wire

154
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,759
we're going to pretend that solved the

155
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:28,880
problem

156
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:30,960
um so so so back

157
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,919
back in the 60s uh especially in the

158
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,280
united states we had this

159
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:36,479
counter-cultural movement

160
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:39,840
uh colloquially known as hippie-ism

161
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:41,520
right um and this was a

162
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,039
backlash against the authoritarian

163
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,479
structures that existed especially in

164
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:47,440
the united states at the time

165
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:48,560
by the youth of the era uh the boomers

166
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:51,600
as it were

167
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,080
um their goal actually uh was to

168
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,240
overthrow

169
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,199
the establishment right through a diy

170
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,440
mentality

171
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:59,280
and individual liberation uh their goal

172
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:01,520
was the creation of

173
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:03,520
a a new utopia where we could live

174
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,120
together in harmony and peace man

175
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,318
um and it was it was actually i mean

176
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,360
it's a lot of a goal right we want to

177
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:08,800
change the world for

178
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,800
better we want to make the world a good

179
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,280
place we we want to like we'd not want

180
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,360
to see

181
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:15,280
world war ii again we'd like not to see

182
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:18,800
vietnam again as a war

183
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:20,000
um and there's a there's this thing that

184
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,479
came out at the time called

185
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,440
called the whole earth catalog um are

186
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:25,120
you familiar with the

187
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,560
who who's heard of the whole earth

188
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,319
catalog

189
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,759
so not a whole lot of you we're digging

190
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,319
way back in time so the first edition

191
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:32,639
was in

192
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:35,520
67 i think and it was printed more or

193
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:37,199
less continuously

194
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,719
up until the late 70s and then all the

195
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:40,240
way like the last edition was published

196
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,919
in the the late 90s or

197
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,680
the early 2000s this is from the

198
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:45,919
introduction of the the first

199
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,280
edition where's gods and might as well

200
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:49,680
get good at it

201
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:51,280
okay boomer um in response to the power

202
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,120
of government and big business a realm

203
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,638
of intimate personal power is developing

204
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:57,199
power of the individual to conduct his

205
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:58,880
own education find his own inspiration

206
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:00,479
shape his own environment and share his

207
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,479
adventure with whoever is interested

208
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:04,000
this isn't a catalog

209
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:06,000
right this is like the hippie sears

210
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,400
catalog is is what this is

211
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,080
this is literally like meant to

212
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:12,880
disseminate information

213
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,599
about how to acquire tools to create a

214
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:17,280
new

215
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:18,960
foundation for civilization tools like

216
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,880
things to build geodesic domes because

217
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:23,520
these are interesting

218
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:25,039
things to use as houses but also tools

219
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,960
as intellectual tools

220
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:28,479
right and the idea was that this

221
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,120
movement inspired by the whole earth

222
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:31,199
catalog

223
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,479
was that as we find new tools we share

224
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:34,160
them with other people

225
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:35,840
right because only together can we can

226
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,199
we create the community to bring about

227
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,520
uh the world that we want to see is this

228
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:40,880
starting to sound familiar

229
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,560
this should sound very familiar to

230
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,879
people in the room um it's

231
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,919
it's no surprise that many of the people

232
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:46,639
who were involved in the whole earth

233
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,159
catalog

234
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:49,680
were early contributors to wired

235
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,879
magazine right stuart brand comes

236
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,759
immediately to mind he's a guy who

237
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:55,280
created

238
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:57,039
the whole earth catalog um

239
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:59,039
and wired promulgated the twin views

240
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:01,759
that technology was leading us to an

241
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:03,599
inevitable future of personal freedom so

242
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:05,360
more technology please

243
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:06,960
and a new capitalist order of nimble san

244
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,160
francisco startups was going to get us

245
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:11,039
at technology it is

246
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:12,639
no coincidence that san francisco is the

247
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:13,520
center of the tech world because san

248
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:15,440
francisco

249
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,878
was the center of the hippie world these

250
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:20,240
two things led one

251
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:21,360
into the other right uh a lot of the

252
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,560
early startups

253
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:26,400
uh uh were founded specifically uh

254
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,319
as an attempt to overthrow the existing

255
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,198
capitals hierarchy as it existed let's

256
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,879
overturn

257
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:33,120
how businesses are created let's

258
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:35,039
overturn how business is done

259
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,719
right this all stems directly from this

260
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:38,718
this countercultural movement

261
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:40,399
of overthrowing authority empowering the

262
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:43,839
people without power

263
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:45,360
and using that to create a better world

264
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:46,959
this view was summed up in a critical

265
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,360
essay called the californian ideology

266
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:50,560
that i

267
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:52,080
highly recommend that you go read that

268
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,000
information technologies empower the

269
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,760
individual enhance personal freedom

270
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,920
and radically reduce the power of the

271
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,600
nation state existing social

272
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:01,599
political and legal power structures

273
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,959
will wither away to be replaced by

274
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,320
unfettered interactions between

275
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:07,599
autonomous individuals

276
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:09,279
and their software right it's not a huge

277
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,519
leap to see a connection

278
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:13,360
uh between this ideology i mean this

279
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:15,200
this essay was critical right of this

280
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,200
of this view highly highly critical of

281
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,640
this view but this is how they summed it

282
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:21,279
up

283
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,240
um it's easy to see how this blends into

284
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:25,120
something like

285
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,839
hey i got a broken printer i'd like to

286
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,399
write the

287
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:30,000
or like access to the the software for

288
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:30,480
the drivers so i can make it do things

289
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,120
that the

290
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:35,040
the manufacturer did not intend right

291
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,959
because the idea of proprietary printer

292
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:39,760
driver software

293
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:40,239
runs extremely counter to this to this

294
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,680
notion

295
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,800
right of liberating people through

296
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:46,479
technology through open access to tools

297
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,479
uh to create the world that we want to

298
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,399
see this is a reference to richard

299
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,560
solman i know not everybody in the room

300
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:54,640
uh is familiar with the the history of

301
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,920
the fsf and the osi

302
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:58,640
but we don't really have time to get

303
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:00,240
into it what i want to point out is that

304
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:04,480
there's there's a very strong continuum

305
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:06,000
between the early 1960s counterculture

306
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:10,640
and the origins of the open source

307
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,640
movement in the 1980s and 1990s

308
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:18,959
so that sounds well and good

309
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:22,160
um so open source isn't political

310
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:23,920
right i don't think so um

311
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,040
the value of openness here's the claim

312
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,560
that i want to make because i want to

313
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,719
question our assumptions and really dig

314
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:31,439
into this the value of openness

315
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,079
is uh that openness is a tool for

316
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,839
creating

317
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:35,839
a liberated world a more just world a

318
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:38,000
world where people feel more empowered

319
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:40,079
right why then are we so afraid of

320
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,079
moving in a direction

321
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:44,079
uh that creates more justice in the

322
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:44,959
world or that is aimed at creating more

323
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:47,040
justice in the world

324
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:48,560
why are we insisting on sticking on a

325
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:51,599
track that we know

326
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:52,959
is creating injustice in the world so

327
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,720
i want to introduce this concept the

328
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:55,839
openness or sorry the paradox of

329
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,760
openness

330
00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:00,240
um and i'm going to do this by talking

331
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:01,600
about the paradox of tolerance uh are

332
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,320
people familiar with the paradox of

333
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,920
tolerance

334
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,279
this has become very popular in an

335
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,079
american political discourse at the

336
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:08,800
moment because

337
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:10,640
uh uh american political discourse is

338
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,839
having a bit of a similar crisis

339
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:14,079
so this comes from call popper

340
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:16,000
ironically

341
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:17,439
the philosopher who first popular

342
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,920
popularized the idea of the

343
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:23,120
of openness as a path to justice

344
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,959
we were not going to go there just now

345
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,399
but this is a very interesting quote

346
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:28,479
unlimited tolerance must lead to the

347
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:29,839
disappearance of tolerance if we extend

348
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,880
unlimited tolerance even to those who

349
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:32,240
are intolerant

350
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:34,000
if we are not prepared to defend a

351
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,760
tolerant society against the onslaught

352
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,640
of the intolerant then the tolerant will

353
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:39,120
be destroyed

354
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:40,480
and tolerance with them we should

355
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:43,200
therefore claim in the name of tolerance

356
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:45,440
the right not to tolerate the intolerant

357
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:48,480
now it doesn't quite work but we can

358
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:50,720
substitute openness for tolerance here

359
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,639
right and we get a very similar argument

360
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,760
structure uh that has the same validity

361
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:55,200
as this argument

362
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:57,360
and i believe it's i believe it's

363
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:59,680
actually quite violent

364
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,680
um

365
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:03,440
and make that point what what what do we

366
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,480
tolerate

367
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,480
in the name of openness

368
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,639
so open source exacerbates existing

369
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,560
injustices

370
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:14,000
right uh those who are at the receiving

371
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,760
end of the software that we create have

372
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,279
no say in its creation have no say in

373
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,880
its deployment have no say

374
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:20,079
in the code itself because they may not

375
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:22,000
have access to computers or the

376
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:24,079
technical skills necessary

377
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,440
right they have no say in the the

378
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:27,040
contracts that we form

379
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,720
with other entities using it in the form

380
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:30,160
of open source licenses

381
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,240
software is used as a tool by the

382
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:34,079
powerful to assert control

383
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,279
and very frequently the control and

384
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:38,079
power that they assert

385
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:38,639
is at the detriment uh to the most

386
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:41,199
helpless

387
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:42,480
uh in our society in the world right and

388
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,000
we're contributing to this

389
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:46,240
we're contributing to this by making it

390
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,360
easier than ever to create software

391
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,360
i mean that was the goal right

392
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:54,560
here we are open source is the

393
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:57,920
playground of the privileged

394
00:12:54,560 --> 00:13:00,399
you and i we learned how to code

395
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:02,399
we have free time convinced like this to

396
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:03,920
contribute to software projects

397
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:05,200
many of the people many people in the

398
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,000
world don't many people in the world

399
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,480
that we want to be

400
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,600
part of our communities cannot be

401
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,480
because they don't have the time they

402
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,160
don't have the money

403
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,360
they don't have the experience they

404
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,399
don't have the equipment they don't have

405
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,839
the privilege

406
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:17,600
to participate in the communities that

407
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:20,880
we want to create

408
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:23,920
um and that very fact

409
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:26,240
creates a an ever-growing wall uh for

410
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:28,959
those without the privilege to joining

411
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,959
our community

412
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:33,040
i have a whole other argument about this

413
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:35,680
but open source incentivizes exploiting

414
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:37,360
a volunteer labor force um i had to cut

415
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:39,519
out a whole lot of slides

416
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:42,000
that led up to this in order to slice

417
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:44,160
this down from an hour-long talk

418
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,680
but you see and many of you in the room

419
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:48,719
probably are maintainers

420
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:51,519
who just don't have the freaking time uh

421
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,240
to answer all of your issues um and how

422
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:54,320
frequently

423
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,760
uh is your software in turn being used

424
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,440
by large corporate entities who are

425
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:59,760
extracting value uh from

426
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:01,600
your free week in labor some of us don't

427
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,360
mind that like that's not a judgment

428
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,279
if you're happy giving away your labor

429
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,320
to those who are able to extract massive

430
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:07,839
value from it

431
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,920
but not all of us are comfortable with

432
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:11,680
that right it's not a just

433
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:14,000
it's not a just contract that we've

434
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:16,479
entered into

435
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,760
so i want us to denormalize the state of

436
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,519
affairs

437
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:21,519
i want to make the world a better place

438
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:24,000
we want to make the world a better place

439
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:25,199
right um let's stop asking the wrong

440
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,240
questions

441
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:30,560
and start asking the right ones so

442
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,600
instead of asking is it open source is

443
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,119
it politics free

444
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,959
is it enforceable these are question

445
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,320
begging questions

446
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:38,638
that are designed to shut down

447
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,440
conversation and shut down forward

448
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:41,120
progress

449
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,480
i don't want to hear these questions

450
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,160
they are not productive

451
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,920
this one will be enforceability will

452
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:48,160
eventually be i think productive

453
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:49,680
but frequently when it's asked right

454
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,199
it's asking the context of

455
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,638
it doesn't matter we can dismiss it

456
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:56,240
because it's not enforceable it's not

457
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:56,240
really a question it's more of a comment

458
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:01,439
that was snark um so what questions

459
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:03,680
should we be asking

460
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:07,360
this is a really good one by the way as

461
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:08,880
a philosopher like i love this question

462
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,800
because i'm gonna i'm not gonna lie

463
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:13,120
philosophy doesn't have answers fosse

464
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,800
only has more questions and it always

465
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,240
starts with with this one and i want to

466
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,920
encourage you especially if you take

467
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:20,800
nothing else away from this talk

468
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:21,680
take this away ask yourself this every

469
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:25,279
day

470
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:26,000
every day but here's other good ones

471
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:27,439
what are the forces

472
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,880
that have led us to this point in time

473
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,399
so i tried to line out some of them it

474
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:32,639
was a very biased history

475
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:34,320
right i got some of the details wrong it

476
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:37,120
came from a very personal point of view

477
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:38,880
it's multi-faceted it's long it's got

478
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,079
lots of people doing lots of things with

479
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:42,800
lots of motivations

480
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:43,519
it's not the only history right but

481
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:46,079
understanding

482
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:46,800
why we are where we are now will help us

483
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:51,279
understand

484
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:51,279
better how to move forward in the future

485
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:56,079
what do we owe to each other's people

486
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,639
i'm a huge fan of scanlon's ethics if

487
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:59,680
you've read the

488
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:01,040
the the um summary of my talk you may be

489
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,959
may have been expecting me to talk a bit

490
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:06,480
more about that but again

491
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:07,839
time um but as we're writing software we

492
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,560
should be thinking about not just what

493
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:10,000
does my

494
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,680
community need my community of

495
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,360
contributors and maintainers

496
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,880
what not just what does the the

497
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,839
community of people who depend upon my

498
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,959
software need

499
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:18,240
but you should be thinking about what

500
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:19,680
are the what are the downstream effects

501
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,360
of this software because it's going to

502
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,560
have downstream effects whether you like

503
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:25,920
it or not

504
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:27,599
right um and we should be thinking very

505
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:29,199
very seriously about what justice looks

506
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,040
like in this context

507
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:32,719
because our software has a much much

508
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,599
bigger much much bigger effect on the

509
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,720
world

510
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:38,639
than we realize that it does and then

511
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:40,880
finally how do we evolve as a community

512
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:43,040
right and this might well mean evolving

513
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:44,160
beyond open source right abandoning the

514
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,800
osd

515
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:48,160
uh looking for new ways of building

516
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,240
communities new ways of building

517
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:52,240
software as a community and

518
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,920
finding something that allows us to

519
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,120
continue to extract what's good about

520
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,479
open source because there's a lot of

521
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,199
good about open source don't get me

522
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,519
wrong

523
00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:00,639
right and apply this in a new context

524
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:02,000
where we can increase the amount of

525
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:03,680
justice that we're creating instead of

526
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,959
just maintaining the status quo

527
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:07,119
and only worrying about the the

528
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:08,480
relatively small circle of people uh

529
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:10,319
that our software has an immediate

530
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,160
impact on

531
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:13,119
um because i believe i believe we do

532
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,240
have the power to make the world a

533
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:16,000
better place i believe we have a

534
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,839
responsibility to leverage that power to

535
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,559
actually make the world a better place

536
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:21,359
and i'd much rather see us succeed as a

537
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:25,199
community

538
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:29,280
uh than go down in flames in an ensuing

539
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:31,200
uh cultural war if you enjoyed this talk

540
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:33,120
here's some resources that i've

541
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:36,240
collected

542
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:38,399
prs are welcome right uh

543
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,440
so feel free to uh to drop other links

544
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,440
that you find in there

545
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:43,120
uh that that might be uh uh might be

546
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:46,559
interesting to other people

547
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:48,159
um and i think we have like two minutes

548
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:49,520
they're all gone i have seven minutes

549
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,799
for questions oh my god i thought this

550
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,840
is going to be a 30 minute talk that's

551
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:55,039
fantastic

552
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:55,039
seven minutes for questions

553
00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:01,840
i'm gonna have to pass around this mic

554
00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:01,840
aren't i

555
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,679
i have no idea how these things work

556
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,559
is this oh this is working now i think

557
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:17,919
two minutes

558
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:19,760
okay that's that's what i thought all

559
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:22,960
right

560
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:24,080
okay i try to go fast yeah

561
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:28,080
thank you very much for this very

562
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:28,720
interesting talk to you very um i agree

563
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,960
with you on

564
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,919
the symptoms that you show but not so

565
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:35,120
much on

566
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:35,679
the diagnosis of things to me it looks

567
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,520
more like

568
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:38,880
open source is one thing one solution

569
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:42,559
that was taken at a time

570
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:45,440
where as you say problems were different

571
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:46,160
um but trying to change it may actually

572
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:49,440
just be

573
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:51,120
uh ignoring what is actually causing

574
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,880
open source to be used in such ways

575
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:55,280
actually uh um

576
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:56,400
which to me is really down to economics

577
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:59,039
and politics

578
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,840
you can actually ask to the licensees to

579
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:01,840
uh to

580
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:03,439
include something about harm no harm and

581
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:05,760
so on you will always have

582
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:07,440
ways to to go around that what is harm

583
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:10,000
uh if you go for

584
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:11,600
repression and you in a country you you

585
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,919
harm some people that you you know you

586
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,120
you

587
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:14,880
i'm going to stop you right there this

588
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,439
is an abdication of responsibility on

589
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,200
our part

590
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,880
uh and i think that's exactly the wrong

591
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,880
kind of response to have

592
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:22,160
uh we have a responsibility as much as

593
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,360
everybody else in the world to create

594
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,520
something that's more just

595
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:28,000
and by saying well we we're not that

596
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:30,480
powerful enough to do it

597
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,320
sorry what i say is you should target

598
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:34,640
something a bit higher up than that

599
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:36,240
we should target every level including

600
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,760
ourselves we must hold ourselves

601
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,320
accountable because we are part of the

602
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,520
system

603
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:41,760
even if we're at a low level in the

604
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:43,679
system even if there are machines

605
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:45,360
that have much out much greater much

606
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:47,520
more outsized impact on this

607
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:50,000
we are nevertheless responsible in some

608
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:51,679
small part and to the extent that we are

609
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,520
we have a moral obligation to deal with

610
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:54,799
it i understand and it's a very good

611
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:57,420
thing to do

612
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:59,360
i agree on that

613
00:19:57,420 --> 00:20:00,400
[Applause]

614
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:02,559
maybe you should discuss after that

615
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:07,840
because we're going to be i'll be around

616
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:07,840
thank you

617
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:17,039
very interesting should we even go

618
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:17,600
further just you mentioned the no harm

619
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:19,600
clause

620
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:21,360
should we have it like a do-good good

621
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:23,840
class like

622
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:25,039
you can't even use this for a benign you

623
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:27,120
have to actively do good

624
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:28,559
things that would be interesting so so i

625
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,520
don't again i don't know what the right

626
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:31,039
solution is i

627
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,879
am advocating a position of open

628
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:34,000
experimentation so we can find the right

629
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,760
solution to this

630
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,360
right all i know is we haven't found the

631
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:39,120
solution yet um

632
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:40,879
that sounds like a an interesting

633
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:44,158
direction to experiment yes let a

634
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:44,159
thousand flowers bloom right

635
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:49,840
okay thank you

636
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:54,040
[Applause]
