1
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:10,870
so welcome everybody to my talk home

2
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:13,179
news fell version 3 I also talked about

3
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:16,149
news fell last year and this show can

4
00:00:13,179 --> 00:00:19,630
give an update and also gonna have some

5
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:23,409
space for your input because we're here

6
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:25,869
at a meeting with all experts and let's

7
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:27,220
see how this works so these are the

8
00:00:25,869 --> 00:00:29,590
things I'd like to talk about give an

9
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:32,140
introduction on new spell how it works

10
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:33,880
the technologies we use the dependencies

11
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:37,060
on spell checking in general in

12
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:40,330
operating system and what's upcoming

13
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:44,080
so in short new spell is spell checker

14
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:46,239
it's a free open software it consists of

15
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:51,070
a library and a command-line tool and

16
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:54,310
it's written in C++ 17 our team consists

17
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:59,739
of Dimitri from Macedonia and myself

18
00:00:54,310 --> 00:01:01,720
from nan Islands quite rapid through

19
00:00:59,739 --> 00:01:04,268
this spell checking is not trivial

20
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:06,520
trivial some people think I just a long

21
00:01:04,269 --> 00:01:08,950
list of words you check if the words in

22
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:11,890
the list and then you know if it's

23
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:13,870
spelled correctly or not usually for

24
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:17,590
some languages those lists would be

25
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:20,010
endless so all sorts of mechanisms have

26
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:23,799
been devised in order to spell checking

27
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:28,030
to support conjugations complex

28
00:01:23,799 --> 00:01:30,630
morphologies compounds and so on please

29
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:30,630
have a seat

30
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:35,710
so for more on the history of spell

31
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:41,440
checking and you can check some talks I

32
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:43,990
gave in at FOSDEM earlier the specific

33
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:46,899
goals of new spell are to be a drop-in

34
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:49,509
replacement for browsers office suits

35
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:52,180
and all kind of application that you

36
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:56,340
spell checking it sports the my spell

37
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:58,659
and hand spell library dictionary format

38
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:01,860
then big differences with the other

39
00:01:58,659 --> 00:02:04,600
existing spell checkers it's much faster

40
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:07,240
maintainable it has less dependencies

41
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:09,340
it's more portable we as you can see

42
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:12,969
later on put it on compiled on many

43
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:15,310
different platforms and also opens the

44
00:02:12,969 --> 00:02:17,290
door for more optimizations and

45
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:18,280
functionality in spell checking in the

46
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:21,220
future we're

47
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:29,200
other spell checkers have sort of walked

48
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:30,540
into a dead end at the moment so it

49
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,399
supports many character encodings

50
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:37,630
complex words compounding affixing rich

51
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:42,819
morphology etc etc also discussed last

52
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:44,709
time and like before we had now another

53
00:02:42,819 --> 00:02:47,200
grant from Mozilla for which we were

54
00:02:44,709 --> 00:02:49,950
very thankful otherwise we couldn't have

55
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:52,329
had the resources to develop this

56
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:56,290
spell-checking library - where it came

57
00:02:52,330 --> 00:03:00,580
now we had two projects and we're in

58
00:02:56,290 --> 00:03:03,790
sort of 2/3 of the the second project we

59
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:06,610
had a version 3 out recently and since

60
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:09,790
last Friday yesterday we have packages

61
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:11,890
for Debian and Ubuntu so now it really

62
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:14,140
starts to count and it's usable because

63
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:15,940
people don't have to compile it on the

64
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:19,059
systems you just install the package I

65
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:22,390
start using it we did a lot of testing

66
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:25,360
compared to hand spell the differences

67
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:26,828
are necklace necklace Abul and the speed

68
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,900
at the moment it's three side three

69
00:03:26,829 --> 00:03:32,200
times faster but it highly depends on

70
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:33,610
which language you're using and soon on

71
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:37,320
our website will be a complete overview

72
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:45,519
updated overview of those speed ups and

73
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:48,190
performances so a little dive into spell

74
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:49,989
checking won't spend too much time on

75
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:53,560
that unless you have specific questions

76
00:03:49,989 --> 00:03:58,299
on that this is sort of what it entails

77
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:59,890
and to give some examples that you find

78
00:03:58,299 --> 00:04:02,290
along the way which you don't think

79
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:04,268
about normally is that certain languages

80
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:07,030
for example something simple like going

81
00:04:04,269 --> 00:04:09,970
to uppercase or lowercase is not trivial

82
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:12,760
at all so you can see for example for

83
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:17,108
Greek that you can go uppercase it that

84
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:19,899
way but if you go back from the capital

85
00:04:17,108 --> 00:04:22,359
to this one well you know it can be only

86
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:25,900
one but it depends where it's in the

87
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:28,750
word another example is the capital I

88
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:32,409
with dot above for Turkish

89
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:35,380
or the ligature I J Dutch or sharp s

90
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:37,750
German these are things if you would go

91
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:39,280
back and forth going uppercase and

92
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:42,540
lowercase which you do a lot by the way

93
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:46,000
in spell checking you might end up in

94
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:48,850
other words you don't assume you're

95
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,580
ending up at so with previous spell

96
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:54,790
checkers it was usually implemented with

97
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:58,960
specific exceptions and this information

98
00:04:54,790 --> 00:05:01,990
is a complaint in the Unicode library

99
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:04,979
the ICU library so we use that instead

100
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:06,640
of all specific kind of exceptions for

101
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:10,630
supporting all different kind of

102
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:12,820
languages and Lipa hew library is pretty

103
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:17,070
big has pretty wide support on these

104
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:20,200
specifics and it saves a lot it makes it

105
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:21,610
the spell checker much more efficient we

106
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:25,740
don't have to make all these separate

107
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:28,510
exceptions inside we just rely on this

108
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:32,650
so the actual dependencies the library

109
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:39,310
has is lip ICU and Lib boost and nothing

110
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:41,770
else so it's it's pretty independent so

111
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:44,580
after spell checking you won't have

112
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:47,219
suggestions and suggestions are

113
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:50,140
generated in many many different ways

114
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:52,840
the ones with a star are added new in

115
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:57,219
the version 3 the other ones we already

116
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:59,289
had and some people asked how do these

117
00:05:57,220 --> 00:06:02,050
suggestions get generated well you can

118
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:04,960
see there are all these different kind

119
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:08,350
of ways of finding suggestions they all

120
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:10,539
got stacked in a file and return to the

121
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:14,620
user like these are suggestions with

122
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:17,380
which you can fix your error was not yet

123
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:19,270
in the air though you can force it for a

124
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:21,640
certain language is to push a suggestion

125
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:23,080
all the way to the top to have that as

126
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:25,840
the first suggestion because you know

127
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:28,900
that's probably what the user wants but

128
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:30,940
in the future we can generate all the

129
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:34,359
suggestions and sort them for example by

130
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:36,219
word frequency and probably all of you

131
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:39,139
had one-time suggestions from spell

132
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:42,620
checker than you think what is that

133
00:06:39,139 --> 00:06:44,960
so we try to make the world a little bit

134
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:50,629
more boring by putting the most likely

135
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:53,060
spelling suggestions at the top if you

136
00:06:50,629 --> 00:06:56,689
want to use this library it's very

137
00:06:53,060 --> 00:07:00,499
straightforward the API is compatible

138
00:06:56,689 --> 00:07:02,719
with our unspell does that these are

139
00:07:00,499 --> 00:07:04,639
some helpful methods to see what kind of

140
00:07:02,719 --> 00:07:07,129
dick tricks dictionaries you got

141
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:10,279
installed on your system you can get the

142
00:07:07,129 --> 00:07:13,909
pass of the specific dictionaries you

143
00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:18,289
can load one and then you're all set

144
00:07:13,909 --> 00:07:20,960
to do some spell checking which is even

145
00:07:18,289 --> 00:07:23,779
more boring very easy you just pass the

146
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:25,698
word and you get a boolean out and if

147
00:07:23,779 --> 00:07:29,210
you have a factor of strength you can

148
00:07:25,699 --> 00:07:31,370
have it filled with suggestions so if

149
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:33,739
you're afraid of implementing spell

150
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:35,839
checking in your software don't be just

151
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:38,330
have it go with you can see it's not

152
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:44,719
rocket science the rocket science is

153
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:49,520
inside the library itself so as I said

154
00:07:44,719 --> 00:07:51,589
it's pretty widely ported because we

155
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:54,139
have not that many dependencies and the

156
00:07:51,589 --> 00:07:56,500
dependencies are on very standard

157
00:07:54,139 --> 00:08:01,460
libraries which are available for most

158
00:07:56,500 --> 00:08:04,689
platforms so at the moment we have these

159
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:10,039
compilers which it all works for and

160
00:08:04,689 --> 00:08:12,860
that it's sort of like maybe 99% of the

161
00:08:10,039 --> 00:08:18,500
world's computers that can work with

162
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:21,649
that very shortly these are the tools we

163
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:24,259
use not very important on if you want to

164
00:08:21,649 --> 00:08:28,159
use a library unless you want to become

165
00:08:24,259 --> 00:08:30,229
part of the team which you're welcome so

166
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:34,880
the things we changed in the version 3

167
00:08:30,229 --> 00:08:37,338
was we upgraded to C++ 17 we use C make

168
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:44,120
to build the library and the

169
00:08:37,339 --> 00:08:46,940
command-line tool the API is easier as

170
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:48,440
you saw before how to setup spell

171
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:49,850
checking you don't have to tell which

172
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:53,390
character encoding or locale you're

173
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:55,280
using default to utf-8

174
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:57,080
the compounding and suggesters have been

175
00:08:55,280 --> 00:09:01,189
improvement it's now three times as fast

176
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:04,700
to operator and spell we made a enchant

177
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:07,880
integration Debian Ubuntu packages and

178
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:11,330
Firefox integration is coming up but

179
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:13,640
this thing is look all really nice but

180
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:16,580
we have to be maybe realistic and maybe

181
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:18,740
you can help with this is that if you

182
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:20,720
have Debian packages how long do you

183
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:27,110
think you're away from getting included

184
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:28,760
in a distribution release yes if you

185
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:33,070
have a Firefox build how long do you

186
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:33,069
think it will take before it's out there

187
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:40,580
months and chance integration it's

188
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:42,350
already a package in Ubuntu so I just

189
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:44,120
need to be updated so that's like maybe

190
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:47,960
on you want to release further down the

191
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:50,510
road but if you happen to be in a

192
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:52,850
position where you can speed things up

193
00:09:50,510 --> 00:10:01,490
on Debian Ubuntu packaging please help

194
00:09:52,850 --> 00:10:06,230
us out then some stuff which is new and

195
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:09,620
I really like to have your input on is I

196
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:12,770
I made a short overview of packages

197
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:14,600
which depends on spell checking so you

198
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:16,910
might now spell checking started with

199
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:23,120
spelled and with I spelled and we had a

200
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:25,069
spell my spell hon spell new spell where

201
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:28,100
those are some specific spell checkers

202
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:29,840
for Hebrew Turkish and finish but I left

203
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:35,450
that a little bit out of scope in this

204
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:38,600
thing so how many of you work on

205
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:41,050
software packages like pack stuff or

206
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:45,620
develop software which is packaged in

207
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:50,540
I'm going to fedora reddit Debian

208
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:52,520
doesn't matter okay so how many packages

209
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:55,959
you think are depending on spell

210
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:55,960
checking libraries

211
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:06,029
long list so I am with these criteria

212
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:07,619
sort of made an overview so on G spell

213
00:11:06,029 --> 00:11:09,239
you have these things depending where

214
00:11:07,619 --> 00:11:11,489
they where they get their spell checking

215
00:11:09,239 --> 00:11:15,360
and jeep spell itself might get it in

216
00:11:11,489 --> 00:11:19,259
another place so this is like fairly

217
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:22,439
reasonable overview and chant is well

218
00:11:19,259 --> 00:11:24,360
known spell check abstraction you can

219
00:11:22,439 --> 00:11:25,980
get spell checking it will see if you've

220
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:27,509
got a spell or an spell or whatever

221
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:29,910
install do the spell check in there and

222
00:11:27,509 --> 00:11:33,569
get it back when you see also other

223
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:40,499
spell checking modules or libraries are

224
00:11:33,569 --> 00:11:42,569
using any chance so I get this sort of

225
00:11:40,499 --> 00:11:46,350
like to focus on like these are all

226
00:11:42,569 --> 00:11:48,779
spell checking software packages and

227
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:59,040
these are all actual end users directly

228
00:11:48,779 --> 00:12:02,879
of ancient yeah so it's a concatenation

229
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:07,410
of spell checking abstractions wrappers

230
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:09,720
so we got I spell which is a fairly old

231
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:13,069
one and you will be amazed how many

232
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:16,879
packages are depending on I spell like

233
00:12:13,069 --> 00:12:16,878
ipv6 toolkit why not

234
00:12:17,689 --> 00:12:24,660
then we get to Python 3 support for

235
00:12:21,389 --> 00:12:27,199
enchants which caters to much more

236
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:29,189
packages than enchants caters itself

237
00:12:27,199 --> 00:12:30,508
I'll just go through it and then we'll

238
00:12:29,189 --> 00:12:33,269
have a small discussion on this

239
00:12:30,509 --> 00:12:37,709
so hunt spell is at the moment the the

240
00:12:33,269 --> 00:12:40,079
best stable released spell checker and

241
00:12:37,709 --> 00:12:42,959
as you can see and chant uses it chrome

242
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:46,429
Ian this is a Hebrew spell checker I

243
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:52,959
spell depends on it I don't know why I

244
00:12:46,429 --> 00:12:57,050
scream estándar bird so we saw dtk spell

245
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:57,050
[Laughter]

246
00:12:57,140 --> 00:13:03,020
it took me half an hour to make up there

247
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:11,270
was one less beer for me yesterday and

248
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:16,140
you can see the really old

249
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:19,560
spellchecker packages using this stuff

250
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:21,090
and it's you find everything in here so

251
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:24,869
I was like almost pulling out where her

252
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:34,230
hair is like so it gets worse we also

253
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:40,560
have a spell okay so oh that's an F yeah

254
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:43,620
it is so for example XML a copy editor

255
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:46,410
anybody knows this application you can

256
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:47,220
use expats you can go to XML create XML

257
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:49,230
so on

258
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:53,100
it also supports spell checking with a

259
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:56,130
spell there is a change to use hon spell

260
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:58,260
try hunting it for three or four years

261
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:59,580
to get that into the final release and

262
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:04,530
they say yeah it should be there it's

263
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:08,010
still not there so this is not only a

264
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:10,170
story on the new spell release and

265
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:12,840
integration and usage in to spell check

266
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:15,030
into software packages but actually for

267
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:18,480
a lot of stuff and it makes me that I

268
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:21,660
made these kind of of use also for fonts

269
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:25,230
that can be so many packages depending

270
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:27,329
on just one or two other packages which

271
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:29,520
if you pull them in this sort of pulling

272
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:32,580
the whole Christmas tree of dependencies

273
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:34,860
and you're stuck with it for years and

274
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:36,210
years and years so when one side I'm

275
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:38,460
curious like what kind of suggestions

276
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:40,770
you have for of course the new spell

277
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:45,240
spell checking library was gonna make

278
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:48,300
your writings much faster better how we

279
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:51,240
can improve that but also maybe a short

280
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:56,930
discussion or questions in general how

281
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:56,930
to deal with this jungle of dependencies

282
00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:05,709
that's my reaction of doing I see this

283
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:08,920
anybody tried to get packages released

284
00:15:05,709 --> 00:15:18,250
and ran into this problem as well yes

285
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:26,649
there please age and still so is it you

286
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:29,200
need to uh huh okay

287
00:15:26,649 --> 00:15:31,240
yeah so the reply was that uh you can

288
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:47,470
better do it your own role at your own

289
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:50,170
way then wait so so the suggestion was

290
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:52,120
to become friends with Debian package

291
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:55,890
moves so I spent the last two days in

292
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:58,510
the Debian mini camp here at FOSDEM I

293
00:15:55,890 --> 00:16:00,430
handed out lots of stickers and so on

294
00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:04,029
maybe I maybe I should have bought more

295
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:07,810
beers but the the people were very

296
00:16:04,029 --> 00:16:10,209
helpful to get me to get the packages

297
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:12,579
properly so we have a boon to a Debian

298
00:16:10,209 --> 00:16:15,189
packages they built they installed a run

299
00:16:12,579 --> 00:16:17,620
and it's everything super to the detail

300
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:19,209
in the last latest versions and very

301
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:22,209
happy with their support so then I

302
00:16:19,209 --> 00:16:24,010
mailed some of them so can you get that

303
00:16:22,209 --> 00:16:28,779
in stable because I'm giving a talk

304
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:30,970
about it no but okay I understand it has

305
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:33,850
to be checks and refuse and so on and

306
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:36,399
less takes time and that's just the way

307
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:38,740
it is I respect that because it also

308
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:44,740
ensures that as quality software in the

309
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:46,390
releases no it's not it should go

310
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:48,370
because it's a new package it should go

311
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:53,050
to new and then it should go to unstable

312
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:54,790
and so again getting it into releases it

313
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:57,250
will it will land there finally that's

314
00:16:54,790 --> 00:17:00,939
not so much my problem my problem or my

315
00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:05,709
worry my my worry is more that if you

316
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:07,480
work with software please use the latest

317
00:17:05,709 --> 00:17:12,500
version of whatever libraries are using

318
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:20,740
and try to to relax on the dependencies

319
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:20,740
because this is so much so much anyways

320
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:31,250
yeah I had to upload the slides and then

321
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:47,000
you have to type in how many pages as

322
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:50,240
well so at the moment we support Ubuntu

323
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:53,450
1910 and debian 10 there is a built for

324
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:56,450
FreeBSD we like to build from these

325
00:17:53,450 --> 00:18:01,220
other platforms if you have interest

326
00:17:56,450 --> 00:18:05,120
please contact us and we help you try to

327
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:07,670
help us or the other way around at the

328
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:09,290
moment the C++ or C bindings fee ID the

329
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:13,210
API but we like to have language

330
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:17,480
bindings for Python Java and so on so

331
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:20,210
Ruby whatever some people told me that

332
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:22,850
there are excellent ways of generating

333
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:26,180
language bindings I like to into that

334
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:29,179
and they have like many different ways

335
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:31,970
of doing it and you can also hint us

336
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:33,620
like I'll try this one to generate it we

337
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:42,230
will do the work just point us in the

338
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:45,979
right direction please so that sort of

339
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:49,430
in short what new spell does what we

340
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:52,520
were up to last year and the shock and

341
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:55,030
all the dependencies tree we came across

342
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:55,030
yes

343
00:18:57,060 --> 00:19:03,399
now C and C++ yeah

344
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:06,460
and if you run into a problem just the

345
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:09,790
question was do I use do we offer plain

346
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:13,390
C bindings or C++ binding we offer both

347
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:17,200
C++ and C and if you're running through

348
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:21,940
a problem trying to link or use our

349
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:22,960
library let us know via an issue thanks

350
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:25,180
for your attention

351
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:33,580
here in this full-time afternoon and

352
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:35,650
there's there more questions so there

353
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:37,179
are nine other the question was what

354
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:40,270
language do we support and what's the

355
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:42,340
process of adding new languages the

356
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:45,040
languages we support are the ones which

357
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:47,740
are also supported by hunt spell so

358
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:52,600
these are already existing we just use

359
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:56,230
these myself involved in updating the

360
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:58,090
Dutch language support you can read the

361
00:19:56,230 --> 00:20:00,130
documentation and start building

362
00:19:58,090 --> 00:20:02,230
language support for excuse me a

363
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:06,430
language which hasn't isn't existing yet

364
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:09,820
if you have questions also contact us as

365
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:12,480
an exercise I I don't understand it why

366
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:15,250
I implemented a Klingon spell checker

367
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:17,500
just to see how that would go route

368
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:20,440
starting from zero and Klingon for those

369
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:22,630
who don't know you can write it in Latin

370
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:25,090
characters but also in Klingon Unicode

371
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:27,190
characters so it was a good test to do

372
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:29,350
spell checking on completely weird

373
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:33,730
Unicode characters which are way down

374
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:35,949
and it still works so well these 19

375
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:38,880
languages sort of reach about 200

376
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:41,350
countries or regions around the world

377
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:46,660
because like many languages are spoken

378
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:54,870
in more countries you have any specific

379
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:54,870
language in mind maybe like elfish

380
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:11,940
like how much yeah it depends how much

381
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:14,460
information you have on that language so

382
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:18,630
for that Klingon I had a founded

383
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:21,420
database in which conjugations were also

384
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:24,300
available and that helped making the

385
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:26,970
effects file but start with the word

386
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:29,280
lists and then see if you can add

387
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:31,740
language rules in order to shorten the

388
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:39,260
word lengths or extend the coverage of

389
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:39,260
compounds and so on yep

390
00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:06,449
so the question is how does the

391
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:10,440
integration go with Firefox and

392
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:12,960
LibreOffice that's just an API as I

393
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:15,120
showed it's it's a shared library or you

394
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:18,240
can link it statically it's just a few

395
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:20,070
calls you make and it's the same calls

396
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:23,160
you make with unspell so if you're going

397
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:25,010
to migrate it's meant as a drop-in

398
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:27,330
replacement so you don't have to rebuild

399
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:30,990
restructure your program in order to use

400
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:33,000
it the second question is how to enrich

401
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:34,500
the dictionaries with word list that's a

402
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,990
good question

403
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:40,710
all spell checkers support personal

404
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:42,900
dictionaries for maybe your your name or

405
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:45,780
the street you live in virtual you slot

406
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:49,680
which may not be in the dictionary for

407
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:52,040
your country but that's our actually how

408
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:54,420
I got involved I'm moved from one

409
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:56,310
installation to another installation and

410
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:58,080
I was moving along my personal

411
00:22:56,310 --> 00:23:00,419
dictionary all the time and it grew and

412
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:02,220
it grew that's like yeah but these words

413
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:04,830
should be in the dictionary so just an

414
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:07,680
you have to look up who is responsible

415
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:09,360
for that contact that person and just

416
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:12,180
send a list of words like please include

417
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:13,260
these for English it's a website called

418
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:17,100
skull

419
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:19,440
maybe you familiar with on our wiki in

420
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:21,120
github there's a whole list of all the

421
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:24,090
languages which are supported including

422
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:25,860
the contact information so you can go

423
00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:28,409
there you can send an email or go to the

424
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:30,990
website they have their rules in order

425
00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:32,160
to include a word or not and otherwise

426
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:34,920
you have to keep it in your personal

427
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:37,860
dictionary and as you saw the whole

428
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:39,600
dependency challenge is also another

429
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:41,850
challenge with personal dictionaries

430
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:45,030
because you have a personal dictionary

431
00:23:41,850 --> 00:23:47,459
for all languages use in Firefox in

432
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:50,580
Libre Office in Asheville in enchant

433
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:51,900
enhance spell so have a look around on

434
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:53,550
your system how many personal

435
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:55,410
dictionaries you have and how much they

436
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:59,490
differ and they also use different

437
00:23:55,410 --> 00:24:02,330
formats so see if you can contribute

438
00:23:59,490 --> 00:24:06,720
words to those upstream dictionaries and

439
00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:07,919
make them smaller lastly I also want to

440
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,910
thank my colleague who couldn't be here

441
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,860
Dimitri

442
00:24:08,910 --> 00:24:11,809
yeah

443
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:14,269
there's a lot of the art in complex

444
00:24:11,809 --> 00:24:19,100
world word work excuse me

445
00:24:14,269 --> 00:24:20,779
and the Dutch foundation open doll who

446
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:22,879
spawns the stickers which are available

447
00:24:20,779 --> 00:24:24,619
here at our Falls Dam stand so if you

448
00:24:22,879 --> 00:24:29,389
had definite stickers yet come buyer

449
