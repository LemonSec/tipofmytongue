thank you for coming i forget how many

3
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:11,920

so far um is there anyone

5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:18,160

6
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,240
so it's been really good watching you

7
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,000
know the community evolve over the years

8
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:24,640
and people getting together and sharing

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,160
ideas and learning from each other

10
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:29,359
um i would like to call attention to the

11
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,920
new radio conference

12
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:33,280
in charlotte in september of this year

13
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:37,120
charlotte

14
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:39,120
charlotte uh north carolina and the u.s

15
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,559
charlotte is a major airport you should

16
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,519
be able to get direct flights from

17
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:44,160
london and

18
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,920
frankfurt at least and a couple other

19
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,760
places

20
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,280
and it's always a very good conference

21
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,800
we have the

22
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,760
european gnu radio days which i would

23
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,599
love to go to

24
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:59,839
except you've scheduled it on top of the

25
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,840
embedded linux conference in the us

26
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:04,640
come on in we're just doing the

27
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,479
procedurals we have stickers

28
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:09,040
please take stickers the guys don't want

29
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:12,640
to carry them home

30
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:16,080
we have a speaker gift of pluto

31
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:18,159
thanks robin and we will also

32
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,240
be able to give some out to people who

33
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:20,640
ask very good questions so during the

34
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,520
talk

35
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,159
think of good questions to ask and if

36
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,039
the

37
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:28,960
jury awards you a pluto that's what will

38
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:32,079
happen

39
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:34,720
and with that is there anything else

40
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:36,158
so we'll stick to the schedule we have

41
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,960
to stick to the schedule because the

42
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:41,680
video recordings are done by time slices

43
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:43,919
so if you end early your next talk will

44
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:47,520
start on time

45
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:49,439
and your talks cannot run over and we'll

46
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,520
do like a five minute gap

47
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:53,279
in between to change the room the room

48
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:55,759
will probably fill up and it will get

49
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,479
very crowded and very hot

50
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:59,680
and there will probably be a line so if

51
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:02,399
you haven't been before

52
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,880
getting in and out can be a problem if

53
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,880
you need

54
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,640
food we can probably send a runner for

55
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:10,560
one occasionally

56
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:14,239
and if you need mate we can do the same

57
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:17,280
so last week we had a hack fest at um

58
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:18,480
east deck in the netherlands outside of

59
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:22,000
leiden

60
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:23,599
organized by andre here and

61
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,520
that was a very nice experience a very

62
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:26,560
nice facility and there was a wonderful

63
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,200
cat

64
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:37,840
and with that we'll let andre explain

65
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:37,839
what we got done

66
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,400
all right thanks philip uh yeah as

67
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:48,800
philip said my name is andre

68
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:50,400

00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,959
radio officer by night

70
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,000
and i had the wonderful pleasure of

71
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:57,360
inviting people

72
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,920
to my workplace three days before fosdem

73
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,040
to

74
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:04,079
have a little heck fest sit together and

75
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:08,000
hack on radio and related projects

76
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:11,120
and uh right oh

77
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,959
i'm wait that's the wrong slides i have

78
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,840
to go here

79
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:19,040
right uh so the slides are also already

80
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:21,519
online you can visit this link and

81
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:23,120
actually if i switch the slides here it

82
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:26,000
will also switch on your laptop then so

83
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:28,319
it's kind of convenient for you

84
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,840
i had other slides before already

85
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:32,640
assembled at the hack first

86
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,760
but then i left my laptop at home so i

87
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,000
had to

88
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,959
yesterday at night i reassembled

89
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,040
everything i could

90
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:41,599
uh remember ah yeah 2 am something like

91
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,798
that

92
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:46,879
so uh sorry if i forgot anything we did

93
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:47,519
at the hackfest we have a lot of people

94
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:49,599
that were

95
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,879
there so correct me if i'm wrong

96
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:54,159
somewhere

97
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:56,959
um all right some facts so

98
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:58,879
it was three days we had meeting rooms

99
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:02,959
from the 28th until the 30s

100
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:05,920
we had food and convenient

101
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:07,840
traveling from the next big city we in

102
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:10,159
total we had 14 participants

103
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,760
including me and six of those were

104
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:13,599
actually going radio officers so that

105
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,439
was a good turnout i think from the

106
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:17,440
grand radio project folks

107
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:19,199
and we also had a space cat on site

108
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:21,358
which helped

109
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:22,960
improve the productivity of everyone

110
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:24,799
attending

111
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:27,758
and also at this point i want to thank

112
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:31,360
my section and my division at

113
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:34,320
isa aztec for letting me invite everyone

114
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:36,479
and book the meeting rooms and yeah have

115
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:40,000
this wonderful event

116
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:43,120
so basically this is how hackfest

117
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,040
looks like it's a bit blurry but uh

118
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,199
yeah we don't need much we just need a

119
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:50,720
meeting room we just need convenient

120
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:51,600
uh like support for food and drinks and

121
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:55,120
then

122
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:58,240
basically some reason to go to a place

123
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:59,919
for example like fosdem so if you

124
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,360
live or if you have something in

125
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:03,758
brussels for next year

126
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:06,240
i think we will be happy to arrange

127
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:06,240
something

128
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:10,400
right there's the space cat that we

129
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:13,440
visited and

130
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:16,638
had some quality time with it

131
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:17,199
and it's actually a real staff so it has

132
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:19,280
a badge

133
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:21,600
and it can go in and out of the facility

134
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:24,239
so no problem there

135
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,280
so what kind of topics we're working on

136
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,120
so

137
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,479
we had one group that was basically

138
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,400
dedicated three days

139
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:31,840
working on the scheduler and the runtime

140
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,960
and it was

141
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:38,479
uh had some high profile members so

142
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:40,880
marcus mueller was there bastian russell

143
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:41,520
and some other grenadier core developers

144
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:45,039
who

145
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:47,919
actually started from scratch and

146
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:50,159
made some progress on that then we had a

147
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:54,240
group dedicated to grand radio 3 8

148
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:56,160
out of 3 module porting and also

149
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,919
coming up with a way how to create a

150
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,800
binary package feed for out of the

151
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:00,719
modules

152
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,000
because right now we have pi bombs and

153
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,199
you have to compile everything from

154
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,720
stores and it's

155
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:09,759
not super convenient for every end user

156
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:12,160
we currently have out there

157
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:13,600
and then we also at the last day we had

158
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:16,800
some

159
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:18,960
smaller group that looked at cmf and how

160
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:22,960
to improve the ecosystem

161
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:26,560
in regard with regard to cmf

162
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:27,440
so the schedule and runtime so the first

163
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,280
day

164
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:32,319
the group had a brainstorming session

165
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:36,318
and basically assembled

166
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:39,520
two page documents something like that

167
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:42,880
with thoughts and basically all the

168
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:46,479
collected lessons learned everything

169
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,479
how to write it correctly

170
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,160
and the second and third day they

171
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,080
basically spent uh

172
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,800
implementing a first proof of concept

173
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:57,758
and uh it's actually already a public

174
00:06:54,800 --> 00:07:00,479
git git repo which can be accessed at

175
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:00,479
this url

176
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:06,240
right um then for the ignorant three

177
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:08,420
eight out of three module porting

178
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,759
we uh had some

179
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:12,080
[Music]

180
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:13,599
features that were implemented for siege

181
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:17,198
oh no no this was

182
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:19,280
great uh yep so uh zack did

183
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:20,639
had some effort actually implementing

184
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:23,758
the

185
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:26,160
qt guy in osmocom fft so i don't know

186
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:28,479
i think a lot of you know osmocom ft and

187
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:31,759
it previously used the wx

188
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:35,120
gui i think in greater three seven and

189
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:37,599
now it's will hopefully soon after

190
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,319
the pull requests or patches get merged

191
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:41,120
support

192
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:42,479
qt and so with that they're also going

193
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:45,680
to radio 3 8

194
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:49,520
which is a nice effort so some more

195
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:52,960
plots from osmocom fft how it looks

196
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:56,400
with cute also

197
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:58,799
nicolas made an effort to actually have

198
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:01,120
one extra column in sigrin which

199
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:03,120
displays the supported versions so

200
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:05,039
if you have an out of three module you

201
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,960
can write in your manifest file

202
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:09,759
which versions you support and we will

203
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:12,799
automatically display this in sigrin now

204
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:15,280
and also if you have a logo and

205
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,240
we click on one of the pages here you

206
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,159
can

207
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,240
have your logo shown there so that's

208
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:22,800
some small fixes but

209
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,840
it's a quality of life improvement for

210
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,560
the packages

211
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:29,039
so also if someone wants to port some

212
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:31,520
modules from 37238 you can just

213
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:33,439
you can just look at the list and pick

214
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:36,240
one of your favorite modules that are

215
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,240
not yet ported

216
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:42,559
yeah and for the automatic package

217
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,000
feed for the order of three modules i

218
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:45,839
was basically

219
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,200
looking at that with several other

220
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:50,320
people how to

221
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:52,240
do it the most efficient way and

222
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,320
the most efficient way will be probably

223
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,600
to add more metadata to the pi bombs

224
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:59,040
recipes

225
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:01,760
then have a automatic let's say

226
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:03,040
templating script which then templates

227
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:07,040
my

228
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:09,040
ubuntu or debian source package files

229
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,480
and then we can feed it through some ci

230
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:13,040
pipeline

231
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,000
which i spent a bit writing the

232
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,680
templates and

233
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,440
it does also get the repo which is

234
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,920
already public but i forgot to put a

235
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,920
link here

236
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:24,480
and hopefully soon i will be able to

237
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:28,160
progress on this

238
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:31,680
in a efficient manner

239
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:36,719
right uh and then on sick mf tooling uh

240
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:40,079
yeah we want to implement and support as

241
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:42,959
many external tools or tools around the

242
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:47,279
negan radio ecosystem with cmf

243
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:47,920
and yeah one part of that is for example

244
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:50,399
to have

245
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,519
one library or header only library for c

246
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:54,880
plus plus which

247
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:57,040
has a good packaging

248
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:59,519
in downstream packages so i looked at

249
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,560
that and posted the pull request to the

250
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:04,160
deepsea

251
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:08,000
lip cmf repo which improves the cmake

252
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:11,600
and hopefully i get some reviews and

253
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:14,399
get this code merged after the hack fest

254
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:18,480
yeah also schneider did some effort to

255
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:20,720
actually implement cmf in or look at his

256
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,079
old code to implement sigmf in in

257
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:25,279
spectrum so

258
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:27,680
if you have a cmf annotated file you can

259
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:29,839
load it in a spectrum and

260
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:32,959
then have like these annotations

261
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:36,959
displayed inside of your

262
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:36,959
spectrum yeah

263
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:42,320
right also at hackfest we do fun

264
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,399
activities and

265
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,600
being at the european space research and

266
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:48,079
technology center

267
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,200
it has some upsides so we can for

268
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:51,680
example

269
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,640
watch 3d cgi and real footage of the

270
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:55,920
high

271
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:58,800
of the iss so basically a nice

272
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,439
image movie of us floating through the

273
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,959
iss

274
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,959
and also learning a lot about

275
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:05,760
microgravity and why we actually do some

276
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:08,160
space research

277
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,200
and also visiting the concurrent design

278
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:12,319
facility at

279
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:13,120
aztec and learning on about how to

280
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,920
actually do

281
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:19,440
spacecraft design in the early stages to

282
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:22,160
get something into space

283
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,440
so conclusions we have some real

284
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:26,160
progress

285
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:27,200
actual code of greater runtime in

286
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:30,160
scheduler

287
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:32,000
thanks to the folks working hard and not

288
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:35,760
for three days

289
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:38,320
we have some packages i actually forgot

290
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:39,200
some packages that got three eight

291
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,760
updates

292
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,360
because yeah the slides were done

293
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:47,040
tonight

294
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:49,760
um and some more interest in cmf and

295
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:51,680
maybe we get some more tooling done soon

296
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:53,279
there's an idea to actually have a

297
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:55,439
g-stock

298
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:57,120
also working on that maybe some some

299
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:00,000
student in this room or

300
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:02,480
from outside this room wants to work on

301
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:06,320
that as well

302
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:09,040
and yeah thanks for your attention and

303
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,880
just join the next hack fest and i don't

304
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,360
know when we will have the next hackfest

305
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:14,720
so

306
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:16,000
we are very welcome to suggestions and

307
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,639
also if there's

308
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,720
some conference or some other event in

309
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:22,639
proximity and there's like three days

310
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:25,360
before that we can have a meeting room

311
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:26,800
for 20 people or 10 depending on the

312
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:29,839
location

313
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:34,560
just come come up chat with us and

314
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:37,680
we might be able to have another one

315
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:52,880
yeah that's about all i have

316
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:54,959
right now

317
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,959
you
