1
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:16,960
my name is ilmari and i'm working for

2
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:20,000
the document foundation as a development

3
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:22,880
marketing person

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,680
it takes a lot more than c plus plus to

5
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:28,560
keep libreoffice going as a project

6
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:31,840
so i want to summarize the various

7
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,840
supporting activities

8
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:37,120
it's useful to get an understanding of

9
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,200
the big picture

10
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:41,040
when something in the software is

11
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,360
changed

12
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,719
you have to ask how does this affect

13
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:48,800
documentation

14
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:51,360
or quality assurance or localization

15
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,078
we should respect equally the work of

16
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:58,559
everyone

17
00:00:52,079 --> 00:01:01,680
and every team

18
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:04,239
translating requires one to have a good

19
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:07,040
command of the target language

20
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:08,720
the translation produced cannot be

21
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,400
machine like

22
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:13,119
it should be easy to read and

23
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:15,680
stylistically appropriate

24
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:17,759
translators have to use specialized

25
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:20,240
technical vocabulary

26
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:21,920
usually this involves researching what

27
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:24,960
sort of terminology

28
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,240
is established in the target language as

29
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,640
a first step

30
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,839
it's recommended to subscribe to the

31
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,560

00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,560
mailing list

33
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:38,799
the user interface and help can be

34
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:42,000
translated in

35
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:44,159
web weblite you log into weblet using

36
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,159
your tdf account

37
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,200
to get full translation rights for a

38
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:49,680
language

39
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,479
you have to contact tdf's localization

40
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,920
manager

41
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:55,439
sophie gotia if you want to start a new

42
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,600
language project

43
00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:00,798
refer to the instructions in the

44
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:04,798
libreoffice localization guide wiki page

45
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:06,799
the links will be included in the slides

46
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:08,720
when translating the user interface

47
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:11,440
you're dealing with very compact

48
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,720
expressions and you have to keep track

49
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:15,359
of the context

50
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:17,280
in the software itself in a future

51
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,160
version of web late

52
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,360
we will be able to associate screenshots

53
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:24,560
with translation

54
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,560
translation strings

55
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:32,400
sometimes help content goes out of date

56
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,840
so it's a good idea to check the reality

57
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,000
in the software

58
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,239
it would be ideal to contribute to

59
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,560
keeping help accurate instead of

60
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:42,720
duplicating outdated information in

61
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,280
numerous languages

62
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,160
if a mistake is spotted and corrected

63
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,360
early

64
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:51,519
it will prevent lots of unnecessary work

65
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:54,160
mistakes and proposals for new things

66
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:56,480
should be reported to bugzilla

67
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:58,319
sofigotia gives assistance in these

68
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:01,518
cases

69
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:03,440
the guidebooks are writer documents but

70
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:04,800
you can still take advantage of

71
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:08,000
translation tools

72
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:09,120
when working on them existing translated

73
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,080
terminology

74
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,879
in the ui and help can be brought over

75
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:17,360
when using

76
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:21,159
desktop translation tool called omega t

77
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:23,040
the translated guides are hosted at

78
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:24,959
documentation.libreoffice.org

79
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,319
announcing your intention to work on a

80
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:30,480
guide is advised

81
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:32,958
to avoid duplicate work tdf wiki

82
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,480
hosts frequently asked questions

83
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:37,040
technical documentation

84
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:39,599
and various other things not everything

85
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,920
in the wiki needs to be translated such

86
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:42,159
as

87
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,359
meeting minutes highly specialized

88
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:47,840
technical notes and

89
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,840
event pages

90
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:52,159
then quality assurance in its most basic

91
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,959
form

92
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:56,319
has arguably the lowest threshold to

93
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:58,480
contribute in

94
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:59,359
one just has to follow steps in bug

95
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:02,640
reports

96
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,760
and to witness the result in the context

97
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:06,319
of qa

98
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:08,000
one can report problems confirm the

99
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:10,640
reports of others

100
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,519
and prevent problems by constructing

101
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:16,399
automated bug catching methods

102
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:18,399
for helping us analyze bug reports we

103
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:20,320
are eagerly awaiting some machine

104
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:22,638
learning based tools

105
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,320
but nothing can fully replace human

106
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:27,840
analysis

107
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:28,400
bug report analyzers known as triagers

108
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:31,599
can be

109
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:34,719
incredibly useful and save a lot of time

110
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:36,400
from developers often three authors are

111
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:43,440
able to pinpoint

112
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:45,919
the exact code chains that caused a bug

113
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:47,120
the bug reports are found in tdf

114
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:50,560
bugzilla

115
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:52,400
and resemble discussion threads having a

116
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:55,120
diverse group of triagers

117
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,080
is important because a single person

118
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,240
cannot deal

119
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,520
with the complexity of libreoffice's

120
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:03,120
functionality

121
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:05,840
supported platforms and locales

122
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,400
in addition to boxilla coordination of

123
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,599
the work

124
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,000
happens in chat channels and the qa

125
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,840
mailing

126
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:16,639
list it is possible to write unit tests

127
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:20,000
in python to test the correctness of

128
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:23,039
libreoffice's internal functionality

129
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:26,240
creating user interface tests is easy

130
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:29,039
as one can now simply log usage

131
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,840
actions and automatically convert the

132
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:33,199
log file

133
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:35,840
into a python test file these tests

134
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:36,800
prevent incorrect behavior on the level

135
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:40,719
of ui

136
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:43,600
slipping in they can also find crashes

137
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:45,680
libreoffice qa is a massive topic with

138
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,800
tons of technical documentation in the

139
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,520
wiki

140
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,479
this is why we point beginners to a

141
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:53,840
crystallized

142
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:53,840
quick start guide

143
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,799
contributing to tdf infrastructure

144
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:02,318
requires

145
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:04,400
skills in linux system administration

146
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:06,240
due to the nature of the work it is

147
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:09,440
usually best to start by

148
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,240
attending an infra team call the calls

149
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:13,680
are announced

150
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:16,479
on the mailing list called website

151
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,199
software on tdf servers is deployed

152
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:20,880
using the

153
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:23,840
salt automation solution infrastructure

154
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:26,000
tasks are tracked in the redmine project

155
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:29,520
management system

156
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:32,560
tdf relies on many web applications

157
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:35,280
that support the contributor community

158
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:37,199
sometimes this means creating customized

159
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:39,520
sites using frameworks

160
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:40,880
but usually just changing the look and

161
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:44,799
feel of

162
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,800
of special purpose applications

163
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:51,919
and here we see a selection of of some

164
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:53,039
of the applications that run on our

165
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:56,639
servers

166
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:58,159
we have the the programming languages

167
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:01,440
used

168
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:03,919
at the left doing web development

169
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:05,520
does not necessarily require privileged

170
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:07,520
access to our servers

171
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:10,240
in many cases we can provide a local

172
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:12,400
copy for use in development

173
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,520
someone with the ability to contribute

174
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,599
upstream

175
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:17,520
improvements to the applications we use

176
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:19,680
would be very valuable

177
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:22,080
this type of development would happen in

178
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:24,400
collaboration with the other teams

179
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:26,560
deployment of new features on our

180
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:31,679
servers might take some time

181
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:34,720
depending on what they concern

182
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:36,880
user support requires a patient and

183
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,319
general attitude towards your fellow

184
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,400
human beings

185
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:43,360
some knowledge of libreoffice and the

186
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:46,560
ability to search for information

187
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:49,759
we don't have a customer support hotline

188
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,240
but other than that support work can

189
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,199
happen

190
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:54,080
all over the known digital communication

191
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:56,080
channels

192
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:57,758
users can reach out for help through

193
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:02,080
social media such as

194
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:05,120
irc or facebook tdf wiki

195
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:08,400
lists local and global social networks

196
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,960
mailing lists and chat channels we host

197
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,878
our own

198
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:13,120
questions and answers site at

199
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:16,319
ask.libroff

200
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:18,240
it is available in multiple languages it

201
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:21,840
is especially valuable if the

202
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:24,560
support person is able to identify bugs

203
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:27,840
in user questions and submit them to our

204
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,840
bug tracker

205
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:32,959
there are three types of documentation

206
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:36,159
for libreoffice

207
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:37,838
help content is dry and brief acting as

208
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:40,479
a reference

209
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:41,760
guide books are for holding the user by

210
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:43,839
the hand

211
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:46,480
the wiki has mostly documentation

212
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:49,920
related to organizing contributions

213
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:52,480
and contributor team workflows but also

214
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:53,760
how-to guides and frequently asked

215
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,800
questions

216
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:59,680
the wiki has the lowest barrier to entry

217
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:04,000
you can log in with your tdf account and

218
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:04,000
immediately start improving the content

219
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:09,439
the guidebooks are written and reviewed

220
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:12,240
chapter by chapter

221
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,760
as individual files using libreoffice

222
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,080
itself

223
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:18,560
new contributors introduce themselves on

224
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,399
the documentation mailing list

225
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:22,000
and are given access to the guide

226
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:25,120
authors next cloud

227
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
group guide authors announce their

228
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,399
intentions

229
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,160
and progress on the documentation

230
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:33,279
mailing list

231
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:36,800
the help content source files are in a

232
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:37,279
custom xml format creating and editing

233
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,279
these

234
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:40,800
is unfortunately not very

235
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:44,000
straightforward

236
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:46,719
tdf staff has worked on tools that make

237
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,200
the editing experience more pleasant

238
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,080
help improvement tasks are tracked in

239
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,640
bugzilla

240
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:54,399
and submitted through garrett code

241
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:57,600
review system

242
00:09:54,399 --> 00:10:00,240
technical writers are able to get paid

243
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,920
for working on libreoffice documentation

244
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:05,360
by participating in the

245
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:07,920
google sponsored season of docs

246
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,480
the documentation team sometimes holds

247
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,599
meetings

248
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:13,680
using chitsy conferencing the meetings

249
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,839
are announced in advance on the mailing

250
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,839
list

251
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:22,079
the marketing team values new

252
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:24,959
perspectives tremendously

253
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:26,000
if you have an idea on how to make more

254
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:28,560
people aware

255
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,160
of libreoffice please let us know

256
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:33,279
immediately

257
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:35,760
libreoffice being a global project a

258
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:36,800
centralized approach to marketing is not

259
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,519
enough

260
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,000
we trust that libreoffice enthusiasts

261
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:42,640
all

262
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,079
around the world are aware of the best

263
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:47,360
ways to spread word

264
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:49,760
in their area tdf regularly

265
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:52,079
sponsors people who want to represent

266
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:55,040
libreoffice at local events

267
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:56,079
the marketing staff at tdf writes blog

268
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,560
posts

269
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:59,599
interviews contributors creates videos

270
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:02,560
and interacts

271
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:04,959
with users on social media anyone is

272
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:08,079
welcome to do the same on their own

273
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:10,560
but tdf staff can also edit and publish

274
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:12,560
content offered to them

275
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,000
there are lots of marketing resources

276
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:17,040
and materials found in the

277
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,600
wiki marketing conference calls

278
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:21,760
are open to everyone and are announced

279
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:24,079
on the marketing mailing list

280
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:26,000
the local and global social networks

281
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:29,279
mailing list and chat channels

282
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:32,800
also act as platforms for planning

283
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:32,800
and conducting marketing

284
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:38,800
visual designers find an ally in the

285
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:41,200
marketing team

286
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:44,399
designing things for marketing materials

287
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:46,160
often allows the imagination to run wild

288
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:47,440
media for the marketing materials

289
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:50,639
include flyers

290
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,839
stickers and t-shirts motion graphics in

291
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:54,880
particular

292
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:57,839
is welcome as we regularly release video

293
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,839
clips

294
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:07,439
and here we have an animation

295
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:08,959
created by a taiwanese team celebrating

296
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:13,440
the libreoffice android

297
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:17,199
weaver and this was created in

298
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:24,560
blender shout out to franklin wen

299
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:27,440
for commissioning the work

300
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,439
yay franklin

301
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:36,160
right on then a more constrained form of

302
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:39,760
design is found

303
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:42,319
in icon themes and document templates

304
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:43,600
contributors are encouraged to discuss

305
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:52,240
with the design team

306
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:55,519
before starting any icon work

307
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,760
tdf bugzilla contains a treasure trove

308
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:58,800
of

309
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:59,439
user requests there are both new and old

310
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,839
reports

311
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,800
that need to be analyzed with a critical

312
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:06,079
eye

313
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:09,199
the user experience team has to consider

314
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:12,000
tough questions is there a better way

315
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:14,079
to achieve the thing being requested

316
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,920
does a request belong to the core

317
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:18,000
software at all

318
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:20,319
how should the requested feature be

319
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,880
implemented in detail

320
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:24,160
will a change cause problems in some use

321
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:26,560
cases

322
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:28,639
the weekly design team meetings are

323
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:31,199
chitsy conference calls

324
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:34,240
and they are an opportunity to discuss a

325
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:36,079
selected handful of reports other

326
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:39,199
methods of communication

327
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:43,439
are chat channels and mailing lists and

328
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:43,439
they are listed on the design wiki

329
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:49,040
ux team members might contribute

330
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:51,040
graphical sketches

331
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:52,079
of proposed changes to the user

332
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,240
interface

333
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:56,239
sometimes they will directly modify the

334
00:13:54,240 --> 00:14:00,079
files that define the ui

335
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:03,199
this does not require c plus plus skills

336
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:06,239
the work is reviewed in gerit

337
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:09,279
the design wiki documents guidelines and

338
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:10,959
user personas that help when reasoning

339
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:13,360
about ux

340
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:15,279
changes to the user interface often

341
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:18,399
require updating the help

342
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:19,439
content ignoring this aspect creates a

343
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:21,920
minefield of

344
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,839
obsolete help articles so it should be

345
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:26,800
taken very seriously and planned

346
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:30,000
alongside the actual changes

347
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:33,040
sometimes we receive proposals for

348
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,760
a complete and unified user interface

349
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:37,439
overhaul however libreoffice has

350
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:39,760
deliberately been built

351
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,519
so that it conforms to the appearance of

352
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:43,279
the operating system

353
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:45,920
therefore these types of proposals are

354
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:48,320
not useful in practice

355
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:49,760
as mentioned earlier we have a ton of

356
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:52,560
different websites

357
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:53,199
and web applications so we happily

358
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:59,839
invite

359
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:59,839
web design contributions

360
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:06,479
yep and finally uh

361
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:07,600
tdf administrative positions getting

362
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,320
into this is

363
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,720
not so straightforward because one is to

364
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,680
win

365
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:15,120
an election the positions are perfect

366
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:18,399
for people having

367
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:21,199
governors near to their heart the first

368
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:24,800
step is contributing for some months

369
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:26,160
in any area one can then join the tdf

370
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:28,800
board of trustees

371
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:30,719
in other words become a member any

372
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:33,599
member can nominate themselves

373
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:35,040
for the board or membership committee

374
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:38,240
elections

375
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:40,000
the board decides where tdf resources

376
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:42,240
are directed to

377
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,040
the membership committee monitors the

378
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,839
communi

379
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:49,199
the contributor community and handles

380
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:49,199
membership applications

381
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:55,839
that was all so thanks

382
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:02,860
[Applause]

383
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:09,839
does anyone have a question or

384
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:25,040
it's a really nice overview

385
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:32,079
sure sure i hope uh people might use

386
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:37,839
this in some local events

387
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:37,839
translate the content

388
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:51,839
yeah i have it already in the notes

389
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:51,839
sure

390
00:16:54,079 --> 00:17:03,839
okay thanks
