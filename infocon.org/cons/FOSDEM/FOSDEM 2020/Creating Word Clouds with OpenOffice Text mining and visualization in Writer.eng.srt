1
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:21,680
so a couple words about me

2
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:24,800
uh uh

3
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,800
as a volunteer uh

4
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:33,600
because uh in my real life

5
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:37,040
i'm a web uh and a scientist and

6
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:39,280
i do not do anything for broken source

7
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,079
projects except for those that we use in

8
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:45,200
our

9
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:47,760
data in general but in my spare time uh

10
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,120
i wrote a time volunteer in the

11
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,160
household office where i

12
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:55,680
also served as a project chair a few

13
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:59,358
years ago when there is

14
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:01,039
and i'm still focused on data

15
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:04,239
visualization text mining

16
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:06,880
and data journalism as part of my job

17
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:07,600
so i tried playing with open office and

18
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,280
trying to

19
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:13,839
they're coming back with microphone okay

20
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:13,840
i'm trying to see what we could do

21
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,399
that the guy was not working out with a

22
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,960
microphone but

23
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:33,280
just to check if it works can you speak

24
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,360
into it

25
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:38,560
but by the way it was recording also via

26
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,560
the yeah i know

27
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,040
there is nothing on channel 1 currently

28
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:55,840
can you look him i believe there is a

29
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:55,840
fair button

30
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,960
maybe you have to push here it's

31
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:11,120
blinking

32
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:13,840
i'm sorry wait

33
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,840
try speaking

34
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:23,840
no no no not yet

35
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:33,840
no i can't see anything should i push

36
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:37,599
something

37
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,560
it's green now speak no i still can't

38
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:42,480
see any

39
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,480
still empty but it's green

40
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,840
no

41
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:05,840
is it blinking yes okay

42
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,879
not anymore try speaking no

43
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,840
no nothing i'm sorry

44
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:30,400
i just pushed again there let's try

45
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,400
i don't know if it was a timeout

46
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,518
not yet now it's not blinking try

47
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:37,680
speaking

48
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:37,680
no

49
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:47,840
no it looks like not i'm sorry

50
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:47,840
what maybe it's muted no it's not

51
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:54,720
okay it would be really funny

52
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:59,870
no nothing i'm sorry just my advice on

53
00:03:54,720 --> 00:04:02,999
channel 2.

54
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:02,999
[Music]

55
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:08,700
[Music]

56
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:19,358
okay by the way there is still the

57
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:22,079
the internal microphone so you may

58
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:22,079
speak louder

59
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:32,400
i tried so well enough about myself

60
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:34,880
and let's really try to respect the

61
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,880
schedule

62
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:43,840
in general

63
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:55,040
so trying to find a shorter way to say

64
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,919
the same things or finding out

65
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:59,520
what the important sentences are and the

66
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:02,320
sentiment analysis is

67
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:03,198
much common on social media these times

68
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,960
understanding

69
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:06,800
the sentence is positive negative or

70
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:09,280
neutral with respect to a certain

71
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,280
culture

72
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,560
but there is a more basic form of text

73
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:15,520
mining

74
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,880
that we can play with even without

75
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,960
specialized tools

76
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:21,759
like statistics on text lists of

77
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:24,080
sentences most common words

78
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:26,800
make indicators about the writing style

79
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:30,240
they try to profile the writers

80
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:33,360
and they find their writing style

81
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:36,560
based on numbers and these uh rewards

82
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,520
so it is possible to have a fingerprint

83
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:41,039
of an author

84
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:42,320
by checking how frequent it is that his

85
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:44,560
uses of

86
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:46,000
certain words or passwords you can

87
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,720
identify

88
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,560
this pattern in the text and a more

89
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,360
basic form of text finding is

90
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,360
visualizing

91
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,960
in general we would use python as they

92
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:01,120
prefer the

93
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,080
language because it's uh the one with

94
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,440
the richest

95
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:08,080
library sector for all data science but

96
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:09,520
specifically for flex mining with

97
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,520
advanced

98
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,799
use cases you would need specialized

99
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,680
drivers

100
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:17,680
and high computational power but for the

101
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:21,039
basic use cases

102
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,039
a local computer is more

103
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:29,600
a typical example of a

104
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:32,960
basic text mining exercise would be

105
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:34,000
read the text file process the text

106
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,479
appropriately

107
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,160
and then produce a word cloud that

108
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:41,919
represents with a picture

109
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,919
the most common words we are seeing

110
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:48,400
so this is an exercise i engage with my

111
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:48,400
students

112
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:03,840
and of course

113
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:17,840
you can capture the trends visually the

114
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,840
news

115
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:45,840
without any uses enemies

116
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:59,840
you can use the text that we did

117
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:15,440
both sides

118
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,560
okay i'm not going back to previous

119
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:19,919
slides uh let's

120
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:22,160
just uh start from here uh

121
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:23,680
we have five but you can obviously we

122
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:26,560
are trying to do something that's

123
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:29,360
some simple text mining without within

124
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,360
open practice

125
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:37,360
getting the text is extremely easy since

126
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:39,519
you just uh it is just one line of code

127
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,039
actually if you go to the user scripts

128
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:44,159
or whatever you want

129
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:48,160
to put your python straight

130
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:50,160
and then the first part

131
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,439
just gets the text of the current

132
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:54,560
document

133
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:56,480
and this trigger i can show it in a

134
00:08:54,560 --> 00:09:01,119
proper text editor that

135
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:04,240
basically is here just

136
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,240
a few um

137
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:10,959
and then you have the text available so

138
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:13,279
from now on

139
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:15,359
we are doing all the processing there we

140
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:18,279
using the internal python then we will

141
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:20,560
resort back to open office for a kind of

142
00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:22,880
visualization the very very

143
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,880
uh

144
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,880
writer has a lot of limitations on that

145
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:34,160
so what do we do in the vital

146
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,240
environment

147
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,519
tokenization we strip out all

148
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,080
punctuation

149
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:40,800
text is converted to lowercase text

150
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,920
becomes

151
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:46,240
a list of word okay we change the data

152
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:48,399
we remove stop words why because

153
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,200
otherwise for any text of analyzer we

154
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:52,240
would see that

155
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:56,240
end or the would be the most

156
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:59,760
used words and of course we don't want

157
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:02,959
them to skew statistics

158
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:05,360
then we filter to remove noise

159
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:07,279
a word that is only appearing once is a

160
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,600
word that can be removed this allows us

161
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:09,680
to

162
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,680
take a very long text with a variety of

163
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:16,800
words and condensate it

164
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:20,640
into a couple hundred relevant words

165
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:22,880
and uh okay we can uh i don't

166
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:24,560
want to waste the time on this but again

167
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:27,680
it is a few lines of code

168
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:28,000
here and you can just get uh there is

169
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:31,519
some

170
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:34,800
there are some tricks to okay

171
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:37,760
to show okay

172
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:39,839
uh there are some tricks to properly

173
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,760
extracted boards

174
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:46,320
and such and replacing everything with

175
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:49,839
space if it is not then

176
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:52,959
with the counter object in python we

177
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:56,320
very we can very simply summarize our

178
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:59,439
list and just extracting frequencies

179
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,760
so our list of words with repetition is

180
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,160
uh

181
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,279
that becomes a native uh python data

182
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:06,880
structure

183
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:11,680
each word and data like uh

184
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:15,360
the word computer appears 34 times

185
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:17,760
and here again it becomes trivial to

186
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,440
assign a popularity score to each word

187
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:21,519
just to single out the ones that are

188
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:26,839
really popular and the ones that are

189
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:29,440
less popular and this is what we do

190
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:30,000
here okay the stopwatch removal was

191
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,720
already

192
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,959
done as part of the previous step and

193
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:38,640
basically here

194
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:41,760
we just calculate

195
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:44,480
the frequency and uh

196
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:47,040
we generate the counters and we compute

197
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,040
frequencies

198
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,600
and now we have to go back to open

199
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:55,120
office this is the

200
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:56,959
the kind of tricky part about still

201
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:59,600
within an absolutely manageable

202
00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:04,079
complexity

203
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:06,639
let's say that we start with

204
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:08,160
an open office document and we want to

205
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:10,399
append the visualization

206
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,760
kind of the word cloud the visualization

207
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:15,120
of word frequencies

208
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:15,120
to the end of this document

209
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:23,760
then we use a cursor and

210
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:28,800
this is documented in apis

211
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:28,800
and it is

212
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:33,680
the missing link that brings back our

213
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:36,880
python objects

214
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:40,079
to something that we can use

215
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:41,600
so we generate the cursor we okay go to

216
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:43,439
the end of document since we want to

217
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,959
append the word cloud to the existing

218
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:47,360
text

219
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:49,680
and with the cursors we will also apply

220
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:53,839
style information we are seeing it

221
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:53,839
in a minute

222
00:12:54,959 --> 00:13:01,680
style information why because a

223
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:04,959
writer is very very limited for example

224
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:09,279
all text in writer has to to be on

225
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:11,920
online while the word cloud is a much

226
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:13,040
more free visualization in general with

227
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:16,560
the words

228
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,560
that can be freely placed

229
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:20,399
okay writer does support floating

230
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:22,160
objects but

231
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:23,760
this would be totally overkill for our

232
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:27,120
example as

233
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:29,920
if we want that we'd rather move to

234
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:32,480
the engine of uh drop and generate an

235
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:35,920
impressive slide

236
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:39,199
but here if we want to stay in uh

237
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:42,560
within writer we want it to be done

238
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:46,000
in uh 20 lines everything

239
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:47,199
we just can set these properties for the

240
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,760
text we are going to

241
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:52,319
write to append to the end of the exam

242
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:55,920
for each word

243
00:13:52,320 --> 00:14:00,160
we compute the right color and size

244
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:04,160
so that it is a little bit nicer

245
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:06,639
and and all of this literally takes uh

246
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,760
20 lines of code you know what is shown

247
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:09,920
here it is just

248
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:11,199
done here if you remove the includes

249
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:13,920
basically it's a

250
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:17,279
it's a word cloud generator in uh 20

251
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:20,399
lines of code that the projector is uh

252
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:24,000
has a wrong resolution so it cannot

253
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:28,079
do it properly but you go from

254
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:30,079
here by executing the macro this is a

255
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:31,199
famous inaugural speech of president

256
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:34,479
obama

257
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:34,880
and if we want to extract the key topics

258
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,000
from

259
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:41,439
here we just run the macro

260
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:44,800
and this is what we get it is still

261
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:49,120
extremely simple but one gets the

262
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:52,959
idea in uh in writer

263
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:55,519
okay that that would be it so you get

264
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:57,760
america american nation you can single

265
00:14:55,519 --> 00:15:01,199
out the most

266
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:04,399
frequent words and

267
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:05,760
this is as far as you get in uh in

268
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:08,800
writer with

269
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:10,639
just an absolutely simple approach like

270
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:14,560
we did

271
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:17,760
which is this possible improvements uh

272
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:19,439
how to use uh other functionality here

273
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,079
there's a lot of stuff that we could

274
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:23,519
improve

275
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:25,680
starting from this very base basic use

276
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:28,480
case

277
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:30,239
which is of course appearance now it is

278
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:35,199
too static

279
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:38,000
and there basically one would uh

280
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:39,359
start with creating something with the

281
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,800
drawing press engine

282
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:45,680
rather than the the writer engine

283
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:46,479
and once you are there there you you

284
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,560
have native

285
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,920
floating objects that you can place

286
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:54,160
everywhere of course

287
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:56,959
with that becomes complexity since now

288
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:57,839
this word cloud is just a stream of

289
00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:00,880
words

290
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:02,800
one after each other where we put the

291
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:04,160
appropriate side to each word

292
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:06,160
there we would have to compute the

293
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:07,839
bounding box for each word

294
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:10,240
and make sure they do not overlap too

295
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:12,639
much so it is substantial in a

296
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:15,920
substantial amount of new work

297
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:18,399
but uh that would be the way to

298
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:20,240
to do this basically we would need the

299
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:22,560
positioning algorithm that

300
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:24,160
currently we just don't have we just

301
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:27,040
dumped it all out

302
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:27,040
in one line

303
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:31,440
and this for appearance but then we are

304
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:34,480
within

305
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:38,399
a word processor and this means we can

306
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:41,040
improve the quality of uh our uh

307
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:41,920
word cloud in ways that would be quite

308
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:45,439
hard to do

309
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:48,479
in other contexts for example

310
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:52,399
openoffice knows about stemming

311
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:55,120
meaning recognizing in our example

312
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:58,240
that america and america are basically

313
00:16:55,120 --> 00:17:02,079
the same word share the same root word

314
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:05,439
and we can't do that since

315
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:09,280
our spell checker within an

316
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:13,679
open office uh already does it for the

317
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:13,678
manchester operation and

318
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:18,079
i haven't tested it but if it was

319
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,000
possible to interface with

320
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:21,119
the han spell engine that we use for

321
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,119
spell checking

322
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:24,399
this would automatically improve the

323
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:28,399
quality by

324
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:31,919
reducing uh each word to its most common

325
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,799
appearance and okay then technically

326
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:35,200
they're standing

327
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:36,320
and limiting climatizing means choosing

328
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,240
the right

329
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:41,918
representative between america and

330
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:41,919
america for example in this case

331
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:47,600
another thing that we could do in an

332
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:51,919
excellent way

333
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:56,000
if we wanted to improve this further

334
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:59,360
is using synonyms because the word cloud

335
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:03,200
inherently has a big limitation

336
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:06,240
it mixes up the significant

337
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:08,320
and the the significance is the word

338
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,440
you use to express a concept and the

339
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:13,760
meaning is of course

340
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:17,039
what you want to convey so if i say

341
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:18,080
say brilliant and excellent and i want

342
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:21,679
to actually say

343
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:22,639
the same thing the two frequencies will

344
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:25,760
be separated

345
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:28,880
and there is no way to understanding uh

346
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:33,840
it but we do have a synonyms engine in

347
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:37,520
office so we could resort to it

348
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:38,720
and uh trying to interface with the

349
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:42,240
tutorials

350
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:43,039
and try to cluster words with the same

351
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,280
meaning

352
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:47,760
and again this would be more or less the

353
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:51,120
same process we've seen before

354
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:54,240
but but

355
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:56,000
with with the fact that we are now going

356
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:58,720
into the semantic world

357
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,799
trying to figure out what the world

358
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:04,640
actually means and not

359
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:04,639
and not just the way it looks

360
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:11,760
another improvement that

361
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:14,559
would be possible in theory

362
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:15,520
is the part of speech tagging we do have

363
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:19,918
support

364
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:23,440
limited support for uh grammar checkers

365
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:26,480
part of speech tagging means find out

366
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:29,919
if uh a word

367
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:34,640
is a noun or an adjective in good

368
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:38,720
like a good boy or a for the common book

369
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:41,919
and this

370
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:44,960
would allow us to restrict our uh word

371
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:47,520
cloud to only a taxes for example

372
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,480
making it much more homogeneous and much

373
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:51,520
nicer to see

374
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:53,840
to to read for every other leader the

375
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:56,080
appearance would be the same but

376
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:57,360
the meaning to a reader would be much

377
00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:01,199
richer

378
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:03,520
this is quite hard and uh yeah

379
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,200
the rest is probably feasible here we

380
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:09,918
are going into something that

381
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:12,159
becomes uh harder to do

382
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:14,960
while going back to stuff that we could

383
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:15,919
uh do rather easily sentiment analysis

384
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:20,080
and other things we

385
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:23,679
would be able to probably do and uh

386
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:27,280
also the coupled from the world listings

387
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:32,000
like one creates word lists

388
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:35,200
with uh known bad or uh

389
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,799
or good characterizations and this could

390
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,880
be implemented with the similar

391
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:42,720
statistical approach but outside

392
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:42,720
the world cloud setting

393
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:50,799
and okay we rushed a bit uh during

394
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:50,799
the time but that's it thank you

395
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,960
if anybody has questions or want to see

396
00:20:55,360 --> 00:21:00,799
the code or anything

397
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:03,600
please do you have a

398
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:05,600
kind of a range uh when you give

399
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:07,520
breaking to the two words you know

400
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:09,520
in the actual implementation i mean so

401
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:12,158
you give a ranking from zero to one

402
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:14,158
yes but is there a limit of ranking

403
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:14,960
meaning that it's just one decimal for

404
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:17,840
example

405
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,840
or examination

406
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:24,320
i compute well at the moment

407
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:26,480
i simply take the data and compute

408
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:27,678
maximum and minimum so i assign zero and

409
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:31,120
one to cover

410
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:34,159
all the font sizes i want to okay

411
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:37,280
it depends on the amount of work exactly

412
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:40,159
exactly so i take that the text and i

413
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:41,120
stretch it to be always between zero and

414
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:44,960
one

415
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:47,600
that's because i was say that i

416
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:48,640
really have to say i love to use styles

417
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:51,439
but

418
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:52,320
i'm obsessed obsession by the time so

419
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:55,280
the first thing

420
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:56,799
that came to me that you talk you've

421
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,879
been talking about stuff but

422
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:58,879
in

423
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,080
one could prepare character styles

424
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:14,880
indeed yeah i think that

425
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:16,399
this uh applied could could be a could

426
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:19,360
apply if you have

427
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,679
a limited number of you know uh styles i

428
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:22,080
mean

429
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:27,840
arrange that that's why the previous

430
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:27,840
question yeah

431
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,880
yes if you want to use set styles then

432
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:37,360
you would

433
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:38,640
i'll do something to match categories to

434
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:41,120
make intervals to

435
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,120
a certain

436
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:47,120
implementations of sentiment or for

437
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:51,679
example you may

438
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:51,678
use some kind of decipher that

439
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:58,640
we're trying any other questions okay we

440
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:58,640
have time for one or two questions

441
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,400
uh yes there are more but uh okay it is

442
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:10,080
a list of stuff

443
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:12,240
if you see it the proof of concept is

444
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:15,600
not really complete like

445
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:23,840
like here for example with you and your

446
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:23,840
would have to be removed

447
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,840
yes with python libraries if you can

448
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,840
leverage

449
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:35,039
the full python then you don't need to

450
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:38,000
hard code stopwords

451
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:39,360
as a sequence as a list of awards that

452
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,919
you make up yourself

453
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42,799
there are existing softwares with with

454
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:45,360
most

455
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:47,440
uh text processing libraries for python

456
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:50,719
and they are localized into

457
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:52,799
into languages so

458
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:54,640
that is just because i was uh doing it

459
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:56,559
in 20 lines but

460
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:59,440
with the same approach yes that's

461
00:23:56,559 --> 00:24:02,639
perfectly visible

462
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:04,880
question yes okay

463
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,880
so

464
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:20,480
the interface to open office and block

465
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:25,440
is for that matter

466
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:28,640
uh that is a bridge that gives you

467
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,640
the possibility here

468
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:33,039
you are in python and you get you will

469
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:36,720
run this

470
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:37,279
within a writer but this is the bridge

471
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,919
that

472
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:40,799
will get the text from the document to

473
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:44,320
writer

474
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:45,360
and the cursor here is the one doing the

475
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:48,320
opposite thing

476
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:49,840
meaning bringing what you have and being

477
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:52,240
able to insert it

478
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:54,158
into the document and these are the the

479
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:57,600
two but uh

480
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:58,840
the api is documented and and it is just

481
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:01,840
there

482
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:01,840
highly

483
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:16,399
grammar checker is not native in open

484
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:19,760
office so

485
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:23,120
uh it is available through extensions

486
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:24,080
and the extensions use either java or

487
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:26,879
python

488
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:29,840
and but it is not a native engine there

489
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,840
is

490
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:47,039
it's time to clean the floor

491
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:47,039
to the next speaker

492
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:55,919
you know the nice thing is that

493
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:58,959
everything gets recorded since it is a

494
00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:58,960
wi-fi microphone

495
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:11,840
all the comments are going down

496
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,399
you
