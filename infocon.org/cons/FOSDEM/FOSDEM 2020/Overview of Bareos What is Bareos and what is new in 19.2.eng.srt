1
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:09,040
so

2
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:13,759
hello and uh welcome back again

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:17,920
um i will give you an overview of

4
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:20,960
barrios tell you what it is and

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:23,519
let's get started first who am i

6
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,800
my name is andreas roger i am developing

7
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:28,159
barriers for a living

8
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:30,160
like all my colleagues

9
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,640
and i do customer support at barrios

10
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,800
gambia on kokage

11
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,079
i'm a long time user of barriers and

12
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,120
with a long time i mean

13
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:41,040
long time like since the project started

14
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,839
and there was a predecessor

15
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:45,120
which i've been using like almost 20

16
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:48,239
years

17
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:51,360
um i have a background in it operations

18
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:54,959
and systems administrations um

19
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:58,079
yeah so where do i work

20
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:01,199
barriers in kukaki is

21
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:03,280
the company that funds the barriers

22
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:06,240
project

23
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,439
with whatever the project needs like

24
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:12,080
build systems

25
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:15,439
developers coffee you name it

26
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:18,720
um it's also

27
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:20,399
a business that provides binary package

28
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:24,560
subscriptions

29
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:28,000
um you can have technical support

30
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:31,759
where you can talk to me if you want to

31
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:35,119
we offer training and

32
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:37,759
we have partnerships with local

33
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:37,759
providers

34
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:45,040
the local providers also allow us to um

35
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:48,320
provide the support in local languages

36
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,280
so we do it for english and of course

37
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:52,398
german because

38
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,040
that's our native language but we also

39
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:57,360
have

40
00:01:53,040 --> 00:02:00,560
a dutch um french

41
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:04,240
um spanish i think

42
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:08,000
yes something russian i'm not sure

43
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:11,359
not really not anymore um so

44
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,520
if you uh like barrios

45
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,280
you will probably find uh some some

46
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:19,200
local partner in your language

47
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:22,480
if you want to have support um and

48
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:26,399
yeah so that's for

49
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:29,679
this so what is barrios

50
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:33,040
um the name is um

51
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:37,040
yeah somewhat of an acronym for backup

52
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:40,239
archiving recovery open sourced

53
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:43,519
now what the what does that mean

54
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:47,280
first of all it is open source so

55
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:50,319
everything is released under agpl

56
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:53,680
and other compatible licenses like

57
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:56,720
bsc licenses open ldap license zed lib

58
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,959
license some public domain stuff

59
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,480
everything we programmed for ourselves

60
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:04,400
is agpl

61
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:06,560
but we're standing on a lot of great

62
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,480
libraries and projects which may have

63
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,640
different licenses

64
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,840
everything we do and i really mean

65
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:15,200
everything we do

66
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,599
we release on github there is no open

67
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:20,560
core

68
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:20,560
or whatever all code is always on github

69
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:26,640
however open source doesn't mean

70
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:28,080
open binary so if you want to have the

71
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,440
latest binaries you can have a

72
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,959
subscription from us

73
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:33,920
or you have to build it yourself or your

74
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,920
distributor needs to do

75
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:40,879
it's extensible which is

76
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,760
an important point for a backup backup

77
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:45,359
solution

78
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:47,920
we have a lot of

79
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,040
are how to extend the system the usual

80
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:52,798
backup system can

81
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:54,480
move files from a to b and back um

82
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,920
maybe you want to do something before

83
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,959
you move the files so you can add a

84
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,559
script

85
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:00,080
maybe you have something complicated

86
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:03,360
which is not a file

87
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:06,000
so you need some specific uh way to

88
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,439
to actually do the backup so you can

89
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,439
write a plugin

90
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:12,480
there's a plugin interface in every of

91
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:14,879
the components

92
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,679
so you can extend everything of the

93
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,440
system

94
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,680
and if that's not enough it's open

95
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:21,759
source you can change it

96
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,160
if you want to add something open a pull

97
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:28,479
request

98
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:31,680
it's network based um everything runs

99
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:35,120
um over the network so

100
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:38,320
um if you do a backup it's passed

101
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:41,520
from the system that is backup

102
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:42,000
to a system that takes the backup over

103
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:47,280
an ip

104
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:50,320
network ipv4 ipv6 um

105
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:53,679
and we do encryption by default so

106
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:57,040
um all network connections

107
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:59,040
starting with barriers 18.2 unless you

108
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:03,039
explicitly disable it

109
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:05,039
will use tls with pre-shared keys

110
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:06,719
which you already have configured

111
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:08,080
because for barriers you need pre-shared

112
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,800
keys

113
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:12,159
and every connection will be encrypted

114
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:16,800
by default

115
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:20,000
with uh openssl um

116
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:23,280
what else it's multi-platform

117
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:26,000
and it really is right now we

118
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:27,359
um build binaries for at least 13

119
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,639
platforms

120
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,759
um including major linux distributions

121
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:34,800
like

122
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:38,080
uh the whole red hat stuff suse

123
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:41,360
uh debian ubuntu um

124
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:44,719
we also have binaries for freebsd

125
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:47,199
um mac os and

126
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,320
windows and some of the commercial

127
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:52,880
unixes like

128
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:56,080
solaris hp ux and aix

129
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:59,759
so you can build

130
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:01,758
for more systems if you need it

131
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,800
and you have a c plus 11 compatible

132
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:05,919
compiler

133
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:07,520
we can probably make it work and

134
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:10,000
probably you can even make it work

135
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,000
yourself

136
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:15,759
last but not least it's it has an

137
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,360
enterprise focus

138
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:22,080
so some of the features are

139
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,720
targeted to an enterprise audience like

140
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:26,159
you get

141
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:29,440
a catalog where you can do your um

142
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:32,319
your reviews um so you know

143
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:33,120
what files went where and when did this

144
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:35,280
happen

145
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:37,199
you can configure detailed data

146
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:40,559
retention how long to keep stuff

147
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:44,000
around these are great features

148
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:46,160
for all users but

149
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,600
they made it into the project because

150
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,720
they are interesting for enterprise

151
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:52,479
users

152
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:54,400
that doesn't mean we don't want

153
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:56,960
normal people or home users to use the

154
00:06:54,400 --> 00:07:00,840
product it's just the

155
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:03,840
focus is on the enterprise whatever and

156
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,840
enterprises

157
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:17,680
yeah ah and lastly don't forget

158
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:20,239
it's a backup software

159
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,280
so basically as i said it moves files

160
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,080
from a source

161
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:25,840
to some destination and once you lost

162
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,400
the files on source or you don't want

163
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:30,479
them

164
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:33,840
you can just move them back um

165
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:37,199
so that is what barrios is how does it

166
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:40,239
work this is

167
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:44,960
an overview diagram of

168
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:48,160
uh the architecture and i try to

169
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,159
yeah um

170
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:54,400
i try to explain um what the components

171
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:57,680
are and what what happens

172
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:59,758
um so in the center you have a barrier

173
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,280
server so this is a sales slide

174
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:05,520
that's why it's not saying barrios

175
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:08,960
director the component is for

176
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:10,719
sorry so the

177
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:13,039
main component is the barriers director

178
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:15,759
which does the whole scheduling

179
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:16,479
and most of the configuration goes there

180
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:20,000
so

181
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:24,000
what uh backup sets

182
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:26,400
should be done when from where

183
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,039
to where it's all managed by the

184
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,159
director

185
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:34,080
the director also has a catalog

186
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:37,120
of everything that has happened and is

187
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:39,519
restorable so as long as you have um

188
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:42,640
your your

189
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:43,760
catalog entries and media available you

190
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:46,160
can restore

191
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:47,360
and you can also look what happened and

192
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:50,480
what were the log

193
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:52,839
records of the original backup for

194
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:55,839
example

195
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:55,839
um

196
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,480
then the scheduling itself and the the

197
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:03,839
jobs that run

198
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:05,600
move data from some kind of of source

199
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:09,360
which is the file daemon

200
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:11,200
to some kind of destination which is the

201
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,720
search demon or for restore the other

202
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:16,480
way around

203
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:19,519
um the file daemon can do of course

204
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:21,920
files um and

205
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:23,040
as i already mentioned there are plugins

206
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:26,719
so

207
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:29,519
you can for example connect it

208
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,519
to a vcenter

209
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:35,440
system and backup snapshots of your

210
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:38,560
vmware servers

211
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,760
you can efficiently do backups of a

212
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:42,399
cluster of s

213
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:43,680
with glusterfind through another plugin

214
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:48,800
where you don't have to

215
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:51,359
move through all single file

216
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:53,439
but it can just efficiently query

217
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:57,040
gloucester what has changed

218
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:59,360
um i think there's something for

219
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,360
um

220
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:05,839
uh for for uh theft to do something like

221
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,839
this for cfs

222
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,360
which is basically the same thing we can

223
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:12,480
do

224
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:14,000
backup microsoft sql server on a windows

225
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:18,399
machine

226
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:22,079
with incremental backups i think

227
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:23,120
um we have uh ndmp support so if you

228
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:26,160
have a large

229
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,640
filer that that supports ndmp we can

230
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:30,160
also

231
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:33,439
backup this um

232
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:36,640
we have also some

233
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,519
newer plugins which are now in core to

234
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:40,319
back up

235
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:41,760
for example mysql databases this has

236
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,079
been the contribution

237
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:45,600
uh that is somewhat older it's now part

238
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:47,839
of the course so there's a plugin for

239
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,839
this

240
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:53,279
we also have a plugin for

241
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,680
overt or red hat virtualization which is

242
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:57,760
new so you can also backup and restore

243
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:00,079
these virtual machines

244
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:01,839
adding plugins is not that hard we try

245
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:05,040
to make it even easier

246
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:07,120
so i hope we are going to see much more

247
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,560
things you can backup and restore with

248
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:11,839
barriers very

249
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:13,518
very soon on the other hand the search

250
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:17,200
demon

251
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:17,600
yeah it can write to the usual suspects

252
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,200
like

253
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:25,120
disk storage obviously

254
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:25,120
tapes and tape auto changes

255
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:30,480
where you can just store the data on the

256
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:33,279
tape auto changer you can also have

257
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,320
tape encryption halfway type encryption

258
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:37,519
and we can write

259
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:42,000
to uh the cloud which uh

260
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:45,200
maybe an s3 backend a set back end

261
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:49,440
gluster fs as described and

262
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:52,000
you can do disk to disk

263
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:54,000
to tape for example so you can migrate

264
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,519
from one storage to the other and back

265
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,240
and from one data center to the other

266
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:59,600
and back

267
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:03,279
if you want to so

268
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,279
that's what it does um

269
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:08,720
what are the key features or what do i

270
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,760
believe

271
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:16,000
are the key features of barrios

272
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:19,600
first of all the catalog database so

273
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,720
for a lot of the simpler backup systems

274
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,639
you find around

275
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,240
you can take backups you can restore

276
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:27,920
them but you have no

277
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:29,760
way to say like okay what backups of

278
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:31,519
that file on that server in that

279
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:34,639
directory do i have

280
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:36,839
and where are they stored um

281
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:39,660
so that's one of the great strengths i

282
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:41,440
believe various has

283
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:44,959
[Music]

284
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:47,120
encryption on multiple levels i already

285
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:47,760
mentioned tls encryption by default for

286
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,839
all

287
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:53,279
tcp connections i also mentioned

288
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:56,720
hardware encryption for

289
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:59,760
lto tape drives well we can also do

290
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:02,320
something that is um called

291
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:04,839
zero knowledge backup where the file

292
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:08,320
daemon actually has

293
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:12,320
um uh a private key

294
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:15,600
and the public key and encrypts the data

295
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:16,079
with its public key it's stored on the

296
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:20,320
sd

297
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:22,399
the sd card read it the director has the

298
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,959
metadata so it knows how the files are

299
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:26,079
called

300
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:28,880
but it can never uh look into them

301
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:30,239
and only the file daemon itself with the

302
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:34,160
correct private key can

303
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:35,920
then um decrypt the data when it's

304
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:39,279
restored

305
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:42,240
so if you have documents which are

306
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:44,560
problematic you can just back up your

307
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:47,760
bosses or your

308
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:50,880
human resources people's laptop

309
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:55,360
with this and the administrator has no

310
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:55,360
chance to take a look at the files

311
00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:01,920
also it's quite firewall friendly

312
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:03,839
um it's it works over the network as we

313
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:07,040
always said

314
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:10,160
there is not that much of a

315
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:12,240
different network ports that are used

316
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,519
and you can choose the direction so you

317
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:16,639
have a single port

318
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:17,519
per connection the file demon to the

319
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:21,120
storage daemon

320
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:21,519
is one connection and the director to

321
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,760
both

322
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:25,279
other daemons or the other are the

323
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,639
others and you can choose in which

324
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:28,880
direction these are open

325
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:30,560
so you can configure your client to

326
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:32,880
actually connect

327
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:34,638
to your server if you don't know the ip

328
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:37,279
address of the client because it's dhcp

329
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:37,279
for example

330
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:42,000
but you can for example also make sure

331
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,160
that all

332
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,199
that the connection from the storage

333
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:47,920
machine

334
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:49,439
to the client that is back up happens in

335
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,719
that direction and not the other way

336
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,800
around as a default

337
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,000
for example if you the machine you are

338
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:57,439
backing up is

339
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:00,480
in um it's in a dmz

340
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,680
so you have to poke a hole into the

341
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,399
firewall of course but

342
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:07,439
just in the direction into the dmz and

343
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:07,440
not the other way around

344
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:16,240
um ndmp support is one big thing

345
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:19,600
not so much for the the normal

346
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:22,880
for the normal customer but um

347
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,760
for larger companies with uh netapp

348
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:27,519
filers

349
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:29,040
that's really really relevant

350
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:31,120
we have a plugin interface that i

351
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:34,480
already mentioned um

352
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:38,839
that is great so you can just extend

353
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:42,639
everything with c plus and

354
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:44,959
python which makes things really really

355
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:44,959
simple

356
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:50,639
so what's new what did we change

357
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:59,680
what did we change in the project

358
00:15:55,519 --> 00:16:02,720
first of all nowadays all our commits

359
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:04,399
go into the master branch this might

360
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:07,440
seem obvious

361
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:10,639
to us it wasn't

362
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:13,680
now it is we adapted the github flow

363
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:17,519
which actually means we

364
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:18,160
work on things um publish them as a pull

365
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:20,800
request

366
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:22,160
discuss them publicly even the changes

367
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:26,160
we do internally

368
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:29,199
and then either accept them or we don't

369
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:29,839
we try to get the community more

370
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:31,920
involved

371
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:34,000
we had quite a few community

372
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:38,959
contributions last year

373
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,959
and we hope we get a lot better at that

374
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:43,920
um we do code reviews for every changes

375
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,600
which is actually happening because of

376
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:48,079
the github flow

377
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,440
um so every pull request one of our core

378
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:51,758
developers opens is

379
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:54,000
peer reviewed by another core developer

380
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:57,199
before it is

381
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,600
moved into master we have

382
00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:01,839
much improved automated testing i don't

383
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:04,079
want go to go into detail too much but

384
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:06,400
i think the number of automated tests

385
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:09,119
has at least doubled if not tripled

386
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,120
in the last year

387
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:14,159
we have upgraded our continuous

388
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:15,919
integration system to work much faster

389
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:19,679
do better tests

390
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:23,520
and um we nowadays

391
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:27,039
build every commit um on every branch

392
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:30,799
so we know everything we do builds

393
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:34,480
and works for everything but

394
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:37,679
the uh the unix platform so

395
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:40,240
um the linux of freebsd

396
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:41,600
and stuff is everything automatically

397
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,440
built and tested

398
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:45,760
so every change even if you have a pull

399
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:47,679
request we can just wait for it to build

400
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:49,360
take a look at it and tell you okay

401
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:52,480
that's a great idea but it doesn't work

402
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,479
on freebsd sorry

403
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:57,440
we moved the documentation to rest which

404
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:03,200
is basically a good idea because it's

405
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:06,080
much simpler to edit

406
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:07,360
um than the latest documentation uh was

407
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:10,720
before

408
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:13,760
um and now actually

409
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:17,039
we we start to to um

410
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:19,039
to push ourselves and each other

411
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:20,640
to open a pull request which already

412
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:22,000
includes the documentation for the

413
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:25,120
change

414
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:27,440
which is huge improvement

415
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,639
so what changed in the software what are

416
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:31,679
the notable features

417
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:34,480
of 19.2

418
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:35,600
we have the pacona extra backup plugin

419
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,160
finally

420
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:40,719
in the core so many people have been

421
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,720
using it

422
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:48,240
we have a plug-in to backup overt

423
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:52,320
and red hat virtualization um

424
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:56,320
which uh will be in a separate talk

425
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:58,720
i'm not going into detail very much now

426
00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:00,960
we now can run a job when a client

427
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:03,360
connects to the director so if you have

428
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:05,280
a laptop for example you can set it up

429
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,678
so if you come to the office and plug it

430
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,760
in

431
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:09,120
and it hasn't run a backup for some time

432
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:12,559
it will just start

433
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:14,399
when you when you connect it we have a

434
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:19,039
database copy tool which

435
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:19,039
is probably still somewhat experimental

436
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:23,439
that doesn't sound like a big deal but

437
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:25,600
you can copy your mysql catalog into a

438
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:28,720
postgresql database

439
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:30,240
so for people who want to migrate this

440
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:33,280
may be a good idea many people on the

441
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:33,280
mailing just ask for that

442
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:40,400
we have finally the python

443
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,960
rayos client library um has now added

444
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,280
support

445
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:44,160
for the tls encryption of the new

446
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:47,120
protocol

447
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,520
so that was the last thing that didn't

448
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:50,320
do

449
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:52,480
encryption by default and we have some

450
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:55,120
minor performance improvements i'm not

451
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:57,039
going into detail too much on that

452
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:59,600
so what's the future direction where do

453
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:59,600
we want to go

454
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,400
we want to partition the file table if

455
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:06,159
you have a barriers installation

456
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,919
and you have more than just a few

457
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:11,760
clients you might have noticed

458
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:15,440
this gets somewhat big um

459
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:19,039
we'll try to to cut this down it's not

460
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:21,919
completely decided how what and when

461
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:22,400
but that's going to happen we will have

462
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:25,440
a lot

463
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:26,960
of new plugins for file daemon at least

464
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:31,039
i hope so

465
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:33,679
um for example for postgresql

466
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:38,080
for maybe object storages so you can

467
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:39,760
just back up your s3 if you want to

468
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:41,840
we will try to improve the day-to-day

469
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:45,360
user experience um

470
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:47,360
there's a lot of little things that can

471
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:49,199
be improved which are really simple to

472
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:51,840
do for example if you

473
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:53,360
uh say you want to restore before a

474
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,799
certain point in time

475
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:57,199
you have to give this point in time

476
00:20:54,799 --> 00:21:00,158
right now down to the second

477
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:02,000
which just doesn't make sense it's a

478
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:04,799
simple change but

479
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,520
i think we have like 50 of these which

480
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:09,520
we can just

481
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:12,879
do and hopefully that will happen

482
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:16,480
we want to do deduplication um

483
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:17,520
on the one hand uh get deduplication

484
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:21,120
friendly

485
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:24,000
um so if you have a system that can do

486
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:24,639
block level deduplication uh the data

487
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,360
rewrite

488
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,919
on the sd will be deduplicated and maybe

489
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:31,678
in the end

490
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:34,559
even um automatic deduplication in the

491
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:37,280
sd backend itself

492
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:39,760
that's a very future story but it's a

493
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,760
direction

494
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:46,480
in which we want to go

495
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:48,399
also we want to overhaul the device

496
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:52,159
reservation load logic

497
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:52,720
um this becomes obvious once you have

498
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:54,559
tried

499
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:56,480
barrios with a tape auto changer with

500
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:59,280
more than two tape drives

501
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:00,320
it sometimes does really really strange

502
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:04,240
things

503
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:04,240
and we will probably uh

504
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:09,200
will have to find just a new way to do

505
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,200
this

506
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:14,240
so lastly if you want to get involved in

507
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:17,760
the project

508
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:20,880
maybe contribute the plug-in um

509
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:23,280
whatever you can get in touch with us

510
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,960
using the mailing lists barriers users

511
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:28,158
at googlegroups.com

512
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:31,760
for day-to-day chat and

513
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:34,159
various level for development talk

514
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:36,559
you can take a look at github uh we have

515
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:38,799
a lot of things going on there right now

516
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:39,918
we had a lot of pull requests you can

517
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:42,639
review or quote

518
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:43,600

519
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:46,640
comment

520
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:49,918

523
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:56,000
course we also

524
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:56,799
we are all around and the next events

525
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,000
will be

526
00:22:56,799 --> 00:23:02,559
a scale in pasadena in the usa

527
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,640
uh if i'm not mistaken that takes place

528
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:07,678
at the beginning of march

529
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:11,039
um then we will be present

530
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:15,360
at open expo europe in madrid

531
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:18,559
which is on in june and we have an os

532
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:20,000
camp also in june after the open source

533
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:23,520
data center conference

534
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:27,440
which is dedicated to uh barrios

535
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:29,840
a whole day i think yes um

536
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:31,919
and also this is more more or less

537
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:35,360
tentatively but we try to

538
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:38,400
uh make frostcon in augustine in august

539
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:40,639
worked for us too so

540
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:43,600
um i don't know how much time i have

541
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:43,600
left for questions

542
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,559
two so any questions

543
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:54,000
yeah you mentioned that

544
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:56,799
the storage demon can use an s3 backhand

545
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,679
for example what i read is that skeleton

546
00:23:56,799 --> 00:24:00,559
droplets

547
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:02,799
that was last comments i think from 2015

548
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:02,799
yeah

549
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:11,200
2017 is that actually the way to go

550
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:14,559
to use s3 as a background yes and no

551
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:18,480
for you right now as a user yes

552
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:21,760
for us in the long term probably not

553
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:24,799
so we will have an s3 back end

554
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:26,640
we will probably replace the current f3

555
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:29,840
back end with a different one

556
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:32,960
but up until this has happened the

557
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:33,279
s3 back end that is right there now will

558
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,840
be

559
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:35,840
supported

560
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,840
i think you were first

561
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:50,158
i sorry call you that install agents on

562
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:54,480
the vms

563
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:57,840
will work as an atmosphere solution

564
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:59,760
yeah you can you can install an agent

565
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:01,360
into the virtual machine but you don't

566
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,960
have to

567
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:04,479
if you install the agent in the virtual

568
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:06,000
machine you just back up the virtual

569
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,600
machine like you would with a physical

570
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,760
machine

571
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:11,918
if you have a dedicated machine on the

572
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:14,799
vcenter that does the backup

573
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:16,000
it will take a snapshot of the virtual

574
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:19,200
machine

575
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:21,200
back up that and you can then do

576
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:29,840
differential and incremental backups

577
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:29,840
based on change block tracking in vmware

578
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:37,440
yeah so the comment from the back was uh

579
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:39,679
it doesn't work with an esxi

580
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:40,840
you need a visualize vcenter license for

581
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:44,080
that

582
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:46,799
yes um

583
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:47,279
sorry you had uh in your in your picture

584
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:49,360
of uh

585
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:50,880
songs in this nation seth mentioned both

586
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:53,360
places uh yes

587
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,840
what what kind of interfaces are you

588
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:57,918
recording

589
00:25:54,840 --> 00:26:01,279
is that's a good question

590
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:03,679
seth is my

591
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:03,679
i have

592
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:08,639
yeah all right okay

593
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:14,399
what

594
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:15,520
so i i know we have a customer that

595
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:20,320
actually backups

596
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:20,320
his gluster onto seth

597
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:25,679
i don't know why but they do it yeah and

598
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:29,520
they have a large amount of data

599
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:29,520
so okay

600
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:35,039
suffer integration on the

601
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:37,279
service i have a service that i

602
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:41,039
integrated the completely new server

603
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:42,960
yeah and then our setup

604
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:44,158
after the change started completely new

605
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:47,200
backup so

606
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:47,919
it started full and everything so uh is

607
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:52,720
there a

608
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:57,600
way to say hey this is the this backup

609
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:57,600
belongs to this new service

610
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:03,120
not really a simple one okay you can ask

611
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:05,918
me

612
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:07,439
about that later if you want to but it's

613
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:10,480
probably out of scope

614
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:21,840
but good question do we have time's up

615
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:21,840
