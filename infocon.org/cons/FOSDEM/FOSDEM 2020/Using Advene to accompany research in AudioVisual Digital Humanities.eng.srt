1
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:13,360
yes let's go

2
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:17,920
so hello everyone uh my name is olivia

3
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:17,919
ober i'm happy to be there

4
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:27,519
it's fine so i'm from france from north

5
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:30,000
and i'm research engineer and currently

6
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:33,199
freelance consulting

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,440
for research projects and i'm going to

8
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,280
talk to you today about

9
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,040
the video software i developed which is

10
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,920
called adven which is a video annotation

11
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,000
software

12
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,160
and how it's been used recently because

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,800
it's a software which has some history

14
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,480
already

15
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,239
but it still has some uses and

16
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,760
actualities so i will present two use

17
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:53,599
cases two usage

18
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:56,079
of the of the application so recent

19
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:58,239
so since it's a lightning talk i'll be

20
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:00,320
i'll be quick on the project itself

21
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:01,919
and then talk about the two examples

22
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,799
which are the remind

23
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,760
remain method application which is a

24
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:08,479
museology

25
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:11,040
uh investigation method and the ada

26
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:14,479
project which is a media studies project

27
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:16,880
with the berlin so adven

28
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:18,000
what it's a project which started in

29
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,080
2002

30
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,320
so that's rather hard with yannick and

31
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:25,920
pianton champagne university of lyon

32
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:28,000
and we wanted to provide tooling for

33
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,560
accompanying active reading

34
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,680
of audiovisual documents and so active

35
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:36,240
reading is

36
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:38,159
uh the the possibility for a user to

37
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,240
immerse himself in a document to take

38
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:43,520
notes and to

39
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:44,560
structure to to to have a scholarship

40
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,640
workflow

41
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,240
based on his annotation on the document

42
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,399
so to accompany reflections on the

43
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,920
of the document so the the goal is to

44
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:55,360
create share

45
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:57,520
analysis of audio visual documents as

46
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:00,159
things that we call hyper videos

47
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:02,079
basically a mix of annotations and video

48
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:04,479
it's a free software so the project

49
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:06,719
itself gave birth to a

50
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:08,399
concrete artifact which is an

51
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:09,280
application the advent application which

52
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:12,000
is a free software

53
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:14,160
gpl a cross-platform desktop application

54
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,800
using python gtk ng streamer

55
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:18,560
it's been used in different contexts but

56
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:22,160
uh

57
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:25,599
i will talk about two just two two today

58
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:28,640
quickly the interface is uh

59
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:31,760
yes rather common it's centered around

60
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:34,480
a video can i show the

61
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:36,160
yes there's a video player here which is

62
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:38,480
always there and then around the video

63
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:42,560
player you can you have multiple

64
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:45,119
places which we call uh uh

65
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,239
i don't know the name we we use the yeah

66
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,160
okay places for

67
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:49,519
for different views for interacting with

68
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,760
your metadata so

69
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:53,360
you put metadata for instance here i've

70
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,560
got below the video a view which is a

71
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,840
timeline view

72
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:59,599
which is rather common in audiovisual

73
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,040
annotation domain or audio visual

74
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:02,560
manipulation

75
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,159
on the right you've got the same data

76
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,480
which is presented in a different way

77
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:06,720
it's

78
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,599
as a transcription with time codes

79
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,000
presented as

80
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:11,040
the this kind of thumbnails on the on

81
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,440
the video

82
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,879
and then on the right you've got an

83
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:18,159
output of the process

84
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:20,000
so this is the the first two views are

85
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:22,079
the kind of tools there are multiple

86
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,920
other views but these these two views

87
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,000
are the kind of tools that you're using

88
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,958
in your process in your scholar process

89
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,360
process of

90
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:31,200
uh exploring the the content and

91
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,680
constructing your analysis

92
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,440
and this on the right is can be seen at

93
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,920
the output of the process so

94
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:39,440
i didn't tries to accom to to be a tool

95
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,319
that you can use throughout the whole

96
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:43,599
process

97
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:44,319
from structuring and analyzing to produ

98
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:47,440
producing

99
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:51,119
outputs here and we'll see how it

100
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:53,120
goes so basically the important notion

101
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:56,159
to take from this figure

102
00:03:53,120 --> 00:04:00,400
is the black rectangle

103
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:02,239
that surrounds the annotation structure

104
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,920
the annotations themselves the

105
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:05,120
annotation structure which is user

106
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,280
defined

107
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,239
and the different views templates and

108
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,480
queries that

109
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:11,519
are all put in the single package which

110
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,040
is the unit

111
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,560
the documentary unit that you can

112
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,880
exchange

113
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,238
independently from the video so the

114
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,600
video is

115
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:21,918
on the side it's metadata about the

116
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,520
video it we tackled

117
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:24,960
different scientific challenges in this

118
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,639
so knowledge engineering document

119
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,560
engineering hti

120
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:30,720
and also data visualization and the

121
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,880
analysis of activity traces

122
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,240
so that was for the scientific part we

123
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:37,770
were interested

124
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:39,040
uh as researchers and then

125
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:40,880
[Music]

126
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,800
i'll go through the through two use

127
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:46,159
cases in digital humanities

128
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:48,040
so their recent the first one dates from

129
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,919
four years ago and the other one is from

130
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:53,280
2017.

131
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:55,919
so remind method is

132
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,320
a project done by daniel schmidt which

133
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:58,479
now

134
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,599
is no professor at university of

135
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:01,680
valencia

136
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:04,240
the goal was to study the museum

137
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:07,520
visitors experience during a visit

138
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:09,680
and through the methodology used video

139
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,560
based auto consultation so the visitors

140
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,280
were equipped

141
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,320
during an exhibit with a camera on

142
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,239
glasses

143
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:18,400
to capture a subjective view of the of

144
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,360
their visit of their experience and

145
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,758
after the visit

146
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,880
they were they were interviewed by a

147
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:25,520
researcher

148
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:26,240
based on the video of the visit and then

149
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:29,520
the video

150
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:32,479
this interview was captured and this

151
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:33,520
is the primary material so the capture

152
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:35,840
of the interview

153
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:39,520
that was used in advent to be analyzed

154
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:41,599
by the researchers

155
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,359
they transcribed the interview using

156
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,039
using advent they identified

157
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,199
so they had different categories in

158
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:47,599
their methodology so they could identify

159
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:50,720
the

160
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:54,160
the different categories and

161
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:56,880
okay and they used uh relations to

162
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,360
express cell curses of experience so

163
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,199
that's

164
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,720
basically a group of categories that

165
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,560
form a unit

166
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,080
a meaningful unit for the researchers

167
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,319
for the methodology

168
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,840
so the the underlying structure in

169
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:10,400
advent provided

170
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,758
this the support for this kind of for

171
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:14,000
expressing this kind of

172
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:15,840
information and then they could generate

173
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,560
visualization through templates

174
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,758
so these visualizations they they use

175
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,919
them for

176
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:22,960
their analysis during their exploratory

177
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:24,799
analysis

178
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,400
and then they could also put them on a

179
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,759
website afterwards as a kind of

180
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,919
publishing

181
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:31,840
so this is what it gives basically so

182
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:34,799
you've got on the

183
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,440
on the on your left on your left you've

184
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,360
got the

185
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,960
advent application with the timeline the

186
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,639
transcription and so on

187
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,799
you see different lines here that

188
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,000
correspond to the different categories

189
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,080
of analysis so the

190
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,560
the identified categories in the

191
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:50,719
discourse in the interview and then

192
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,560
here you've got on the right what you

193
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,639
can find one of the views that

194
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,080
that is produced by the tool directly

195
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:59,120
through a template system

196
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:04,800
that is available on museography.of

197
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:04,800
fr website so this was the first example

198
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:09,039
uh so i've got to be quick but if you

199
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,000
have questions i'm here today and

200
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:13,039
tomorrow

201
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,639
so the other example is the ada project

202
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:17,360
which is

203
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:18,960
carried out with in a collaboration with

204
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,639
the cine politics team in friar

205
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:23,520
university berlin

206
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:25,440
and the hp hpi in portsdam so

207
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,039
cinepolitics is doing media studies so

208
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:30,960
they're the final users

209
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:33,280
hpi is about uh they have an expertise a

210
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:36,239
good expertise in video

211
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:37,758
analysis so feature extraction and so on

212
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,440
and we brought our

213
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:41,599
expertise in video annotation

214
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:44,240
manipulation interaction and so on

215
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:45,120
and so the goal of the project was to

216
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,879
study

217
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,639
uh the staging patterns in the

218
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:51,440
audiovisual presentations of the

219
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:53,599
financial crisis so they wanted to know

220
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:56,080
if there are patterns that always

221
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:58,000
come again and again when the this is

222
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:01,758
presented in documentaries in movies

223
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:04,080
in feature movies or in tv broadcasts

224
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:05,520
and for this they wanted to apply

225
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,758
quantitative methods

226
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:09,599
so annotate systematically annotate

227
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:11,599
movies and then

228
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:13,120
dig into this data this metadata they

229
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:15,599
produced to

230
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,960
to see first to see for the s for

231
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:18,479
themselves if there are things

232
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:21,280
interesting to

233
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:22,000
to to dig in and then also to provide a

234
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,719
ground truth

235
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
i think a statement next slide yes to to

236
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:29,280
build the ground truth for

237
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:32,240
future automation of the of the system

238
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:33,838
so we we need yeah we wanted to to build

239
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,080
some feature attractions specific for

240
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:36,959
the

241
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:38,000
for the task and we needed uh data for

242
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:40,559
this

243
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,599
so advent provided the the bridge

244
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:43,518
between these

245
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:44,959
issues so the idea was to optimize the

246
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:48,640
manual annotation

247
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:51,839
uh process so in order to to be able to

248
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:54,720
to put students to work so that the

249
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:55,440
teams of students annotated movies and

250
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,959
to provide

251
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:00,000
a bridge between the users manipulation

252
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:01,839
of the data

253
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,839
and its semantic representation because

254
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:04,320
in the end with the hpi team they wanted

255
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:06,480
to

256
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,560
to have semantic so we produced an

257
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,399
ontology it was stored in a triple store

258
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:12,640
and so on so they wanted to have

259
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:14,480
semantic data but the users at the other

260
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,839
end didn't want to deal with semantic

261
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,880
data they wanted to do their

262
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:23,440
keywords or whatever so the tool here is

263
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:25,839
what bridges the gap between both sides

264
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:27,040
and so the application the same

265
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:30,560
basically we did some

266
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:34,240
adaptations but and optimizations and

267
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:37,680
i don't have time for the process so

268
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:39,440
yeah i'll just say that advent was used

269
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,120
to produce an ontology so you can find

270
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,760
the anthropology that was produced

271
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:45,600
through advent through this kind of uh

272
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,319
annotation structure definition that was

273
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,880
carried out

274
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:51,120
in advent and then used to build the

275
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,839
first ontology bootstrap ontology that

276
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:55,279
was

277
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:56,320
after used for uh over multiple

278
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:59,920
iterations to

279
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:02,839
to refine the the ontology and

280
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:04,160
since we now got multiple data so the

281
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:06,720
the

282
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,600
the current news for the project is that

283
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,760
we're still

284
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,959
working together the the ada project

285
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:13,519
itself is not yet

286
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:15,518
completely over and we are working on uh

287
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:17,600
data visualization so we now have

288
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:18,720
uh tens of thousands of annotations on

289
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,560
movies and so

290
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,920
this raises questions of how to

291
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,760
visualize them for the

292
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,120
for for the schoolers for the major

293
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:28,399
studies coolers

294
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:31,920
so we're working on this and

295
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:33,440
oh yeah just one point uh this is free

296
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,880
software which is developed for a long

297
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,320
time and the ada project was the

298
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,920
opportunity for me

299
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,360
just the first point of the the

300
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,959
developments for that project

301
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,399
to update code for adapting to new

302
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:44,479
systems so it was

303
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:46,320
it's an old application which was python

304
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:49,519
2 gt 2 and so on

305
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:51,920
i had to do an update to the new

306
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:54,000
versions of these libraries and i didn't

307
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:56,640
have the time or opportunities and

308
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,160
this project was the opportunity so do

309
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:00,800
not hesitate to

310
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:02,160
to fund projects that may not be fit for

311
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,479
you just right now

312
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,279
but may fit the task but need some

313
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:08,000
developments

314
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:08,959
and yes contribute to the free software

315
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,519
ecosystem

316
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:13,040
by funding such projects that we can we

317
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:16,320
can advance the

318
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:18,880
free software development and

319
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,680
so that's it we so through these two

320
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:22,720
examples

321
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:24,959
i try to show you that this is a

322
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:28,320
flexible extensible usable tool

323
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:31,199
for digital uh humanities and i'm

324
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,320
available also for development or

325
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,720
consulting for this

326
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,720
thank you

327
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:52,719
one short question

328
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:52,720
yes so thank you for this talk um

329
00:11:55,760 --> 00:12:00,319
it's the same yeah the question is yes

330
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:01,839
uh whether it's comparable to end vivo

331
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:04,320
so envivo is one of the

332
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:05,200
propriety tools to that is you that are

333
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:08,240
used in

334
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:11,519
uh ethnography or uh ethographic

335
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:13,279
uh studies this is comparable

336
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:15,440
it doesn't have the same features

337
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:18,639
obviously because it's free software

338
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:19,839
but it's open you can and basically fit

339
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:22,240
the bill for many of the

340
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:24,639
of the needs so yes definitely this is

341
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:27,040
comparable to nvivo

342
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:27,040
thank you

343
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:39,839
okay thank you

344
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,800
you
