1
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:08,080
great

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:09,920
well we're going to get started with the

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:12,879
first of our

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:15,759
collaboration sessions so i'm really

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:21,199
excited to introduce to

6
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:25,279
okay so the idea is that

7
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:28,800
i will tell you my position on the topic

8
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:30,960
i'm i believe i'm a user and

9
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,920
i believe that in this room there are

10
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:37,680
only developers and lawyers and no users

11
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:40,399
so this is uh so who am i

12
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,920
i have a degree in humanities i got the

13
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:45,360
degree in 78

14
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:47,039
when so it was tight written my thesis

15
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:51,120
was type written

16
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:54,719
i've always been involved in marketing

17
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:56,559
i hate outlook and the reason why i am

18
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:59,840
in open source is that i hate

19
00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:03,039
outlook so because i was

20
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,600
trying to find a software that allowed

21
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:07,200
me to

22
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:11,119
not to use outlook so i

23
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:14,240
just basically trashed microsoft office

24
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:16,560
and started using openoffice and eudora

25
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:20,000
at the time and then thunderbird

26
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,200
and believe me i cannot use outlook

27
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,119
really it

28
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:28,640
burns my my brain

29
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:31,360
since 2004 in the open office actually

30
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,320
using openoffice since 2002 into since

31
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:35,439
2004

32
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:38,798
in the in the community

33
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:41,520
and i

34
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:43,360
i entered the community saying i'm a

35
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,158
marketer i can help you in doing

36
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,159
something

37
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,000
and the answer was marketers are

38
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:50,720
completely useless in

39
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,439
free software so you are basically

40
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,439
useless

41
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:55,758
but if you understand and know english

42
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:58,240
you can do some translations

43
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:58,880
and i said okay i can do translation but

44
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:02,079
i think

45
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:05,920
i can do better if i do marketing

46
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:07,679
and so i i think we demonstrated with

47
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,920
openoffice and with libreoffice that

48
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,800
marketing can work

49
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:13,839
in 2010 i was one of the group of people

50
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:18,160
that

51
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:21,360
launched libreoffice and actually

52
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:24,640
this is the 10th as you see from my this

53
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:28,000
is the 10th anniversary of libreoffice

54
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:30,319
and i'm in the pr industry i'm still a

55
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,440
member of the pr association in italy

56
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:34,238
i'm still

57
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:36,400
i'm considered a geek so they say oh you

58
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:39,519
understand technology perfectly

59
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:42,400
and developers considers me an idiot

60
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:42,879
in technology so i basically don't know

61
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,080
who i

62
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:49,200
am and this is how

63
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,319
you know my my main issues i so the

64
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:54,000
first number with

65
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:56,958
user starts counting from one

66
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,319
not from zero and when i said freedom

67
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:01,360
number zero and i said

68
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:04,720
freedom number zero is it's not for me

69
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:06,400
zero is no value so freedom number zero

70
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:09,840
for a normal user is

71
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:12,560
no freedom no value sorry it that's

72
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,959
i've talked with many users and when you

73
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,800
say

74
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,319
freedom number one they say oh i

75
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:19,040
understand so freedom number one

76
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:20,079
is the first one is is very impossible

77
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,720
so

78
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:25,040
shift one in term of numbering if you

79
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:28,080
want to talk with users

80
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:32,079
uh chat i cannot use

81
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:35,519
irc sorry i you know i start

82
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:37,440
sweating when i use irc and i do some

83
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:41,920
mistakes i'm sure

84
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:44,720
uh in in a five minutes chat i can do

85
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,518
10 mistakes in using irc without any

86
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,159
issues

87
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:49,040
so i telegram but i use riot i use

88
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:54,319
metric

89
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:57,280
i need icons i need icons

90
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:59,200
marketing is important for me i cannot

91
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,519
use the terminal

92
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,238
when i present i say that i have a

93
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:04,720
strange

94
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:08,400
religion my religion doesn't allow me to

95
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:08,400
use outlook and the terminal

96
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,480
they told me oh i wrote my thesis with

97
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:16,798
latex and i said

98
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,798
what

99
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:24,880
that's for geek not for normal

100
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:27,360
human beings and of course the

101
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:29,199
presentation they use latex prezi i

102
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,440
don't use prezi of course

103
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,880
but there is a huge amount of users that

104
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:35,919
use that kind of

105
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,639
trash software and we have to to educate

106
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:39,919
them to use

107
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:42,000
real software and then file a bug people

108
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:44,400
says what's a bug i thought it was a

109
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,400
feature

110
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:51,040
okay and

111
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:52,639
when i when i find a bug in libreoffice

112
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,960
and unfortunately there are bugs

113
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:56,720
like in any software the first thing

114
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,799
that i do i talked to another one and

115
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,960
said is this a bug or a feature because

116
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,919
for me it could be a feature

117
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,799
but if it's a bug i will file the bug

118
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:07,520
and

119
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,280
now after so many years as i'm not

120
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:11,758
completely stupid and i've not

121
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,960
lost all my neurons although i'm

122
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:15,280
officially losing the

123
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:17,039
i've been officially losing them for 43

124
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:20,479
years as i'm 65.

125
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:20,479
so we start at 22.

126
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:26,560
i can start to understand but after

127
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:28,800
14 years i can start to understand

128
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:32,240
what's a bug and what's a feature

129
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:35,600
but it at first it was really hard

130
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,560
so to summarize and that's my last slide

131
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,400
so then

132
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:42,320
it's up to you to ask questions you are

133
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,320
not idiots with exceptions of course

134
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:48,720
but there are some users that are normal

135
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:51,599
normal beings so they are not idiots in

136
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:55,759
their profession there might be

137
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:57,680
extremely knowledgeable

138
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:59,440
like some lawyers here but lawyers are

139
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,720
not users that are not developers they

140
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:06,240
are they live on a

141
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:08,880
different planet and

142
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,600
but they may not be interested in using

143
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:12,719
computers

144
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:14,800
so for them using a computer is a tool

145
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,800
but they are not willing to invest their

146
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,960
time in understanding the tool

147
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,000
and i think that open source has never

148
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,479
been friendly to

149
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,960
this kind of users that unfortunately

150
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:28,599
are 90 percent of users

151
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:33,039
so it's kind of at the moment

152
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:33,039
6.8 billion people in the world

153
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:40,639
uh so there is a world of people outside

154
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:43,840
foss that might be interested in force

155
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,639
uh but fosus nev has not been friendly

156
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:47,520
and i

157
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,000
think even if it has progressed in being

158
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:51,280
friendly

159
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:55,199
with users there's still a lot

160
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:58,318
to do a lot of ground in term of

161
00:06:55,199 --> 00:07:00,479
really inclusiveness it's not the

162
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:02,319
question that documentation is missing

163
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:03,599
is missing but it's missing for every

164
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:07,120
software

165
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:10,159
uh the fact is that people should be

166
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:13,840
feel welcome and not like i did uh

167
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:16,560
and i stayed in the in the in the in um

168
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,280
in open source because i'm a very

169
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,639
stubborn

170
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:21,359
person and i said i'm sure that i can

171
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,800
help

172
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:28,000
but at first really the idea is that

173
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:31,840
people wanted to kick me off and

174
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:35,280
i think that was not nice

175
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:36,799
and that's all so if you have questions

176
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:39,919
of course debates

177
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,919
tell me that i'm completely wrong

178
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:43,198
tell me that lawyers are human beings

179
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:45,039
that's

180
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:48,240
also something that i would like to

181
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:48,240
understand better but

182
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:54,560
did you want to um talk about uh

183
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,520
users and the they're standing in free

184
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:59,759
software the

185
00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:04,080
way that licenses work right now is uh

186
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:04,080
only if i am

187
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,000
let me just focus on copyright for a

188
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:12,319
second only if i

189
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:15,599
am using uh

190
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:18,400
the code uh under copyright or

191
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:20,319
i hold copyright more specifically if i

192
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:23,840
hold copyright in software

193
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:28,160
do i have a right to enforce it

194
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:30,560
i i think are you talking about how

195
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,680
wouldn't it be nice if users even though

196
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,440
they don't

197
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,959
have copyright in the code could have

198
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,039
standing in

199
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:39,199
open source software and possibly

200
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:42,319
hardware we have to educate them

201
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:44,480
the problem is that the normal user uh

202
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,519
does not unders that's not even think

203
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,800
that there is a

204
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:52,080
license behind software because i'm sure

205
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:54,079
when i talk to people about the end user

206
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,959
license agreement of microsoft office

207
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,360
they tell me

208
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:58,079
but are you really sure that they signed

209
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,360
it

210
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:02,399
i are you i've never seen it i said of

211
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,040
course because

212
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:06,720
when you saw this the small screen you

213
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,719
said accept

214
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,839
and so you you read only the first

215
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,240
sentence that is

216
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:14,640
microsoft corporation you didn't read

217
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:17,519
the 48 pages that follow

218
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,959
and that are full of clauses that are

219
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,800
against you

220
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:22,079
and say but that's not possible

221
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:25,120
microsoft could not

222
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,519
do this there's such a nice company that

223
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,480
could

224
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:30,800
never do this kind of stuff and then i

225
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,920
usually send them the pdf for the 48

226
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,079
pages say

227
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:36,560
just for your amusement when you are on

228
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:39,519
a on a beach uh

229
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:40,160
print it and read it and and i have

230
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:43,920
people

231
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:47,199
sending me emails saying is that true

232
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:50,160
yes it's true you've signed it so

233
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,279
either you send a letter stamp that says

234
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:54,399
i

235
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:57,839
recuse that and of course i

236
00:09:54,399 --> 00:10:01,120
never use word or office anymore but

237
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:03,600
you're bound by that license

238
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:05,920
but the problem is that people do not

239
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:08,399
know that there is licensing

240
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:10,240
that there are this kind of issues you

241
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:13,120
know i think that

242
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,760
the the perception of people in in open

243
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:18,079
source

244
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:20,640
which is absolutely right is that they

245
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:23,439
give for granted that people

246
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:24,319
as a knowledge of software that the

247
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:27,680
reality is

248
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:32,399
not there so my wife

249
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:34,719
is the typical 95 percent user

250
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:36,000
of the world she hates having a computer

251
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:39,120
but she knows that

252
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:43,200
she has to to use one well

253
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:46,320
my wife just because he's my wife

254
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:48,880
uh we are not even christians so uh we

255
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,160
the the the the the miracle of

256
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:53,760
transistance

257
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:57,040
which is uh passing uh competencies uh

258
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:59,200
through the uh uh through

259
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:01,760
through the air we don't even believe to

260
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,800
that but in the companies where my wife

261
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,959
is working say

262
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:08,479
come on with your husband you must

263
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:10,880
understand this kind of stuff

264
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,320
and now she and starts to understand

265
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:14,480
that there are licenses

266
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,600
that there are there are legal

267
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,880
constraints

268
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:22,959
that there are technical constraints but

269
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:26,160
it's after being my wife for

270
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:28,800
now 35 years and listening me talking

271
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:30,560
about technology for all that time

272
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,479
and i can tell you that although of

273
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,199
course it's my wife but my wife is a

274
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,880
smart

275
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:39,519
lady is not and so let's say that she's

276
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:42,480
in the top five percent of smart people

277
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:42,880
you have 95 which is less smart and

278
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,360
would

279
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:47,120
never understand that there is a license

280
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:50,480
associated so i think to to

281
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:53,920
to get the users in open source

282
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:56,480
we should give for granted less things

283
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,839
help them to understand that software is

284
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,880
based on licenses

285
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:04,240
is a is a is a

286
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:07,519
is a of course it's a i'm not

287
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:08,800
but it's like having a piece of a nice

288
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:12,399
piece of software

289
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:13,839
is like having a la gioconda of leonardo

290
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:17,040
in terms of

291
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:20,000
rights of the author but no one

292
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:20,719
in the real world would tell you come on

293
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,720
that's uh

294
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,160
that's a masterpiece and a piece of

295
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:27,200
software is a

296
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:29,600
piece of sorry because they in

297
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:32,160
many cases they suffer from using the

298
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:35,680
software this is the real issue

299
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:38,719
and i think you know we are too much

300
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:39,359
far away from the normal user i speak

301
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:43,440
too much

302
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:43,440
sorry i know questions

303
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:50,079
so just a slight quibble with your first

304
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,320
statement

305
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:53,199
developers themselves are usually users

306
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,360
in open source

307
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:57,360
because the reason we develop is because

308
00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:00,000
we want to use what we've developed

309
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,560
the specific problem is that if it's

310
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,279
developed

311
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:05,040
by developers for developers somebody

312
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:06,560
who's a pure user with no development

313
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:08,399
skills doesn't get a look in in the

314
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:11,199
development process

315
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:11,760
but the solution for this is supposed to

316
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,160
be

317
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:15,680
a business model so this is a business

318
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,760
opportunity

319
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:19,359
for a corporation to make money by

320
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:23,279
bridging the gap between

321
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:25,040
users and developers now i know it's

322
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:26,320
popular to this mark shuttleworth but

323
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:28,319
his vision for

324
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:30,160
the unity desktop in canonical was

325
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:32,480
pretty brilliant it was basically

326
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:34,160
i will represent the needs i will canvas

327
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,360
users do all the stuff

328
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,519
translate all of the impedance

329
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:39,440
mismatches and employ teams of

330
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:40,160
developers to represent those users

331
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,839
views as

332
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,279
code and we will build something that

333
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:46,320
users want to do

334
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:47,120
so the problem isn't that you're ever

335
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,040
going to get

336
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,399
users directly franchised in the

337
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,920
developer community

338
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:53,680
it's just that all of the business

339
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,959
models where people have tried to make

340
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,638
money doing this

341
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:58,000
seem to be failures we need to find a

342
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:59,040
way of making this business model

343
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,199
successful

344
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:03,199
of course i was extremistic i'm friend

345
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:04,240
of many developers and i consider

346
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:07,359
developers as

347
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:10,240
human beings not so that's

348
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,760
but it was just to kind of be

349
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:16,240
provocative and

350
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:18,480
because i think that we really need the

351
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,600
it can be a business model but in some

352
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:22,480
cases

353
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:24,000
we really have to attract users because

354
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:27,199
it's true that developers

355
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,880
are users but they are users with a

356
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:31,680
heavy technical background

357
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:33,519
which is a different story uh if you

358
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:36,160
take a user that has not a

359
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:38,240
technical background so it's not and

360
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:39,439
there are many that are not enthusiastic

361
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,199
about technology

362
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,720
they're enthusiastic about other things

363
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:45,680
but this is the

364
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,079
a factor of the of the human being so

365
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,560
they

366
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:49,439
they may love arts and not love

367
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,920
technology

368
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,040
but they then they use the computer and

369
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:56,639
the fact is that

370
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:59,199
uh the proprietary world has been

371
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:01,120
better in some senses in attracting

372
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:04,479
these users in some cases

373
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:08,959
with heavy tech ethical issues in

374
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:12,240
behind it but the reality is that

375
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:12,880
some proprietary company looks more

376
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:16,800
friendly

377
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:18,720
to users than than the free open source

378
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:21,920
environment

379
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:24,560
and uh i don't like it because i

380
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:25,519
and i've been in my life i've been a

381
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:29,439
consultant

382
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:32,720
to many because i've started doing pr

383
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:36,079
and marketing professionally in 81

384
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:38,399
so from 81 to 2002

385
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:40,079
i've been a consultant to most

386
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:43,199
proprietary company i've

387
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:44,399
worked for apple for 19 years as a

388
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:48,399
consultant

389
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:50,639
for adobe so i i know very well

390
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:53,120
what these companies are doing and in

391
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:56,240
some cases they are really more friendly

392
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:59,440
there is a lot more enthusiasm in

393
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:01,440
attracting users and we should of course

394
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:04,800
find a business model because that

395
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:06,800
is an imperative i think to to sustain

396
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:10,160
the open source environment

397
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:12,160
but also a way of being more friendly

398
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:15,120
attracting more people that are

399
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:17,040
around outside our world our world is

400
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:19,839
growing

401
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:21,680
but the world outside is just huge

402
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:24,480
incredibly huge

403
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:25,359
there was a question there patrick want

404
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:28,399
to hit me

405
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,399
from behind

406
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,240
thank you um it's just a little question

407
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:41,600
really

408
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:43,440
you said it can be a business model and

409
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,360
i i find that a little bit worrying and

410
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:47,360
i may misunderstand

411
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:49,199
i think there's a lot of confusion

412
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,720
around free and open source software

413
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:53,040
and a lot of it comes from that very

414
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,800
statement it can be a business model

415
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:56,480
and i think it's something maybe if you

416
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,920
don't mind we could clarify because i

417
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,440
think what we're saying is that there

418
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:02,000
are business models

419
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:03,360
around open source but open source or

420
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
free software of itself is not a

421
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,880
business model

422
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,439
right or am i misunderstanding not sure

423
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,559
the

424
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:12,559
but the gentleman was talking about the

425
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:16,000
business model that

426
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:18,799
closes the gap between users and

427
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,160
and developers and was making unity as

428
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:22,319
the

429
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,679
as the example of course business model

430
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:26,000
are around

431
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:27,439
open source and not open source is not a

432
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,559
business model but

433
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:32,880
the reality is that we are

434
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:34,160
talking about people that do not even

435
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:37,120
know that there is an

436
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:38,640
open source uh environment and business

437
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:42,879
model associated so

438
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:44,880
education the education gap is huge

439
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:46,240
and it's unfortunate it's an education

440
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:49,440
gap and

441
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:51,760
in the schools is terribly bad

442
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,480
because i i at least i know italian

443
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:55,919
schools

444
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:58,320
because i base in italy and i talk to

445
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:59,679
too many in many schools in italy and

446
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,520
university as well

447
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:03,440
but i think that the situation is

448
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:06,799
similar everywhere

449
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:10,160
the the the fact that in the schools

450
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:12,840
there's no education at all about

451
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:14,720
the proper education at all about

452
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:17,280
technology

453
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:19,760
there is about tools but that is not

454
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:21,440
about technology

455
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:22,879
showing people how to make a

456
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:25,360
presentation doesn't

457
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:27,120
mean that you are teaching him to

458
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:30,320
understand technology

459
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,320
that's the next step

460
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:36,000
um i was just wondering you mentioned

461
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,120
that we need to get more users involved

462
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,360
in actually using

463
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:40,239
um some of these tools such as

464
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:43,039
libreoffice

465
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,760
or not just open source software of

466
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:46,640
course i

467
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:48,400
i am a libreoffice founder and i'm keen

468
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:50,960
about libreoffice but

469
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:52,640
don't consider me as a representative of

470
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:55,360
libreoffice in this case it's

471
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,080
just open source okay um so like in

472
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:58,159
scenario

473
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:00,639
why would you believe that wait why do

474
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:01,679
you think that in schools and government

475
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,280
institutions

476
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:05,360
um and various different types of

477
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:08,000
offices that may be public sector

478
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:09,918
that we don't actually see operating

479
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:13,360
systems being used

480
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:15,679
of a linux nature and also applications

481
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,559
um just as an example libreoffice or any

482
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:19,600
other one

483
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:22,639
being used by those particular

484
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:25,280
users okay

485
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,400
so my personal opinion is that

486
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:29,200
unfortunately

487
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:31,360
today is that there's patrick there that

488
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,799
wants desperately to ask me a question

489
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:36,559
richard so that's

490
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:39,600
uh i think that

491
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:41,600
and this is a personal vision but and

492
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:44,719
it's based on my experience uh

493
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:48,399
unfortunately uh the political world

494
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:51,360
is driven by lobby in a in an increasing

495
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,840
way all over the world not just in

496
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,320
europe

497
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:56,080
not just in the states if you think that

498
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:58,879
here in brussels

499
00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:00,399
there are three official lobbyists for

500
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:03,679
each

501
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:07,039
member of the parliament

502
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:08,480
that's an unbalanced and they are not

503
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:11,679
working for open source

504
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:16,960
software they are working for

505
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:20,080
the other world i cannot see what you're

506
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:22,720
okay it's a little bit far away

507
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:24,799
uh so you started off by identifying

508
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:27,679
sort of two communities the

509
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:29,280
the the developer community that and

510
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:31,039
user community and they appeared to be

511
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:32,158
individuals so individuals within those

512
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:34,640
communities

513
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:36,159
and then are there so i guess i'm

514
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,480
wondering around the messaging that we

515
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:39,200
give

516
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:40,960
in in the different communities because

517
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:44,159
advocacy for adoption

518
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:47,919
could be specific to those groups or

519
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:50,400
um often it's seen uh geared toward

520
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:52,000
um corporations governments as the

521
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:55,039
previous question was

522
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:58,320
and that's a different community so

523
00:20:55,039 --> 00:21:01,280
i guess someone around messaging and

524
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:04,080
that the messaging that we might use to

525
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:07,280
advocate for adoption among individuals

526
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:08,559
is different than what we would present

527
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:10,960
to

528
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:11,760
governments or businesses i don't think

529
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:14,640
the average

530
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:15,200
in my opinion my friends families

531
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,880
colleagues

532
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,240
probably aren't going to concerned as

533
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,799
much around

534
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:23,120
open source being a increasing the pace

535
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:25,120
of development or driving innovation or

536
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:27,439
reducing total cost of ownership or all

537
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:31,760
those other things that we traditionally

538
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:34,000
cite to get adoptions within

539
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:35,919
companies so i guess the first question

540
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:39,679
is is

541
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:42,720
the investment in individual adoption

542
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:44,799
worth doing versus going after large

543
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:48,080
corporations and government

544
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:50,559
and if those are both equal

545
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:52,320
in what we should be doing shouldn't we

546
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:55,440
be developing different messages

547
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:57,360
for those different constituencies

548
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,799
of course yet i mean the answer is of

549
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:00,879
course yes the the

550
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:02,799
the environment that we have around us

551
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:06,000
is a lot more complex than i

552
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:09,360
depicted but it was just to simplify

553
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:12,480
the story uh i think that

554
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:15,678
the the basic idea is

555
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:18,799
that we should be more welcoming

556
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:22,320
and more helpful to its

557
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:25,918
external publics to help them

558
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:27,678
in first understand what open source is

559
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:30,000
because i think the big gap is

560
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:30,880
that they don't have a real idea of what

561
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,080
open source

562
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:34,640
means and the first question is uh and

563
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:37,360
this is

564
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:40,559
the a question that you get in all

565
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:43,520
letting countries if it's free

566
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:45,678
it must be buggy or there is a trick

567
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:48,639
behind it

568
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:49,440
and of course we know that it's not the

569
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,840
reality

570
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:53,760
but that's unfortunately might be the

571
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:55,360
perception and we have to fight this

572
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:57,360
kind of perceptions

573
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:59,678
and of course then we have politicians

574
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:02,399
and we have lobbyists and we have

575
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:05,600
organizations that are complex to more

576
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,600
complex to tackle

577
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:14,000
hi um so my impression

578
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:14,879
is and i'm curious if you agree with

579
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,000
this

580
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:20,960
that the public has been starting to

581
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,000
uh to realize uh all the things they've

582
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,840
been agreeing to

583
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,000
in these license agreements with a lot

584
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:28,000
of recent news coverage about

585
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,600
uh the large tech companies i'm

586
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,640
wondering if if you think there's an

587
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:33,840
opportunity there

588
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:34,840
just for us to um and i don't know how

589
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,659
exactly but

590
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:38,000
to to

591
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:39,679
[Music]

592
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,520
take advantage of that and just tell

593
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:45,360
people like hey we exist

594
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:47,039
we're um we are

595
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:48,479
we make all these things that you don't

596
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:51,840
have to agree to all these

597
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:54,320
um all these crazy license agreements to

598
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,320
to use

599
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:59,520
of course the more the more there is

600
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:01,678
debate about

601
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:03,760
around open source the better it is for

602
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:06,400
for open source in a sense

603
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:09,039
but in on the other hand some of the

604
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:10,880
debates that we have seen over the last

605
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:12,158
couple of years are not entirely

606
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:14,240
positive

607
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:16,880
because they are representative of a

608
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:19,840
huge friction inside open source that

609
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:20,799
the reality is not probably not there is

610
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:23,360
a friction of

611
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:24,720
some companies versus open source at

612
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:30,080
least this is my

613
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:33,279
my personal opinion uh and of course uh

614
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:36,960
but i think we should do we should

615
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:40,240
be do more outreach ourselves

616
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:42,240
uh and do outreach uh not

617
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:44,080
being prepared to have people that do

618
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:46,320
not understand at first what we are

619
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:49,039
telling them

620
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:50,000
and then be patient and start really

621
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:54,240
from the basic

622
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:57,520
from scratch and show them that

623
00:24:54,240 --> 00:25:00,320
there is high professionalism

624
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:01,120
behind open source as there is in behind

625
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:04,158
any

626
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:04,559
other software but actually if you look

627
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:07,520
at it

628
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:08,720
in a really good way there is a lot more

629
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:11,279
professionalism

630
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:13,440
behind open source than behind

631
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:15,200
proprietary software at least this is my

632
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:18,240
point of view

633
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:20,080
uh i know the time is over but i i would

634
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:23,120
like to say one thing for us

635
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:25,520
we we in italy and this is a

636
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:27,760
about libreoffice but could be about any

637
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:31,360
other open source software in italy

638
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:34,400
we have migrated the ministry of defense

639
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:35,760
so they have 100 000 users which is not

640
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:39,520
trivial

641
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:42,400
and we we told them

642
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:43,600
we help you in in going through the

643
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:47,039
process

644
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:50,480
and we as a kind of nice gesture

645
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:53,679
we do that for free as volunteers

646
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:54,720
but you have to follow our training

647
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:56,640
program

648
00:25:54,720 --> 00:26:00,000
and the training program starts with

649
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:03,440
four hours on about open source software

650
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:05,360
which is not about how you use a rider

651
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,640
calc or impress but it's about open

652
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:09,120
source software

653
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:10,159
and it's usually me doing that and they

654
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:12,239
said

655
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:14,159
okay but we are not interested in the

656
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:16,000
first four hours and we said okay if you

657
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:19,600
don't do the first four hours you do

658
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:22,960
we won't do the other 32.

659
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:26,639
uh so we started and i i started in

660
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:29,440
a in a pact there were over 50 people

661
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:31,279
uh some of them with medals going up

662
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:34,000
from here to there because they wanted

663
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:37,360
to show that they were generals or

664
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:39,600
and the the they when they showed up

665
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:40,959
they they had question mark in their

666
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:43,760
eyes like

667
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:44,880
we know we have to to to lose four hours

668
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:48,158
with that

669
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:48,880
stupid idiot uh old italian uh and at

670
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:50,880
the end

671
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:52,159
they at the end of the of the four hours

672
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:55,679
they most of them

673
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:58,559
thanked because they i told them

674
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:59,440
normal things but things that they were

675
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:01,918
not even

676
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:03,039
supposing could be behind open source

677
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:06,159
software

678
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:07,679
like how we do security how we do

679
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:08,640
development how we coordinate

680
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:12,000
development

681
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:15,279
