1
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,399
thank you

2
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,519
so good morning everyone not so many

3
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,679
people this morning but

4
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:16,960
maybe on sunday morning normal so

5
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:18,960
welcome

6
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,480
our first speaker of play will be claire

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,039
giordano who is working

8
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,920
in the microsoft team on the podrest

9
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,400
things

10
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:28,720
and she's from status data can you say

11
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,640
that all again with a much louder voice

12
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:32,320
stephanie's going crazy back there

13
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,840
all right i have to scream a little bit

14
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,840
more so

15
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,280
people know from microsoft team from

16
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,399
cytos data

17
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:42,840
working on progress and

18
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:46,160
amazing speakers so give her home

19
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,160
welcome thank you

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,680
so how many of you have been to the

21
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,719
postgres dev room before

22
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:57,360
um at first time here okay and for how

23
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:59,520
many of you is it your first time

24
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,719
all right so more first-timers what i

25
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,039
will tell you is

26
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,960
last year the first talk of the day did

27
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:06,720
have fewer people just like this

28
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:08,479
i don't know what the problem is with 10

29
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,560
o'clock in the morning but apparently

30
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:12,479
there's a problem at fosdem

31
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,560
and then by the second or third talk the

32
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:16,560
room which fit 300 people was

33
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,159
full so if you're here and you're

34
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,439
interested in staying i recommend you

35
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:21,040
keep your seat

36
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:22,960
because it should fill up as the day

37
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,640
progresses um

38
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,080
so my name is claire giordano and i'm

39
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,880
here to talk to you today

40
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:30,240
about fibonacci spirals and 21 ways to

41
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:33,280
contribute to postgres

42
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:36,240
beyond code so before we start

43
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:38,320
i want to put a face to the name and

44
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:42,640
this man had lots of names

45
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:45,360
leonardo pisano bigelow leonardo of pisa

46
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,479
leonardo bonacci and it turns out the

47
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,720
fibonacci

48
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:50,640
was actually his nickname and it means

49
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,479
literally son of bonacci

50
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,240
and oh my gosh did i pronounce all those

51
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:57,600
names properly

52
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:59,679
fibonacci fibonacci okay i should have

53
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:02,240
asked for your help on this first slide

54
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:04,399
thank you we have a real italian sitting

55
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:06,560
here in the front row

56
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:10,318
so he was as most of you know a 12th

57
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:13,040
century italian mathematician

58
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:15,119
now the sequence you're probably also

59
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,679
familiar with but what most people don't

60
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,000
know

61
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,440
is that fibonacci did not discover the

62
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,080
fibonacci sequence

63
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,879
it actually first appeared in writings

64
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,959
in india

65
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:27,200
hundreds of years before fibonacci's

66
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:30,080
time and he traveled extensively

67
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:32,480
in the middle east and when he came back

68
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:36,000
he wrote a book called liber abachi

69
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:37,440
did i say that right close enough and

70
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,239
and that book was all about the

71
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:42,959
mathematical methods of commerce

72
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:43,840
and it had two major impacts on the

73
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:46,319
world

74
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,680
the first is that it really popularized

75
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:49,839
the hindu and arabic

76
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,519
number systems because at that point in

77
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,319
time they were still using roman

78
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:55,040
numerals

79
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:56,238
where fibonacci was from and the second

80
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,400
impact was

81
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:00,080
the fibonacci sequence and in the book

82
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,640
he posed this question and i have to

83
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,040
read it

84
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,000
to make sure i get it right and the

85
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,359
question was about

86
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,920
does anyone know what the question was

87
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:11,440
about somebody tell me

88
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:14,480
okay it was about rabbits so if a pair

89
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:16,640
of rabbits is placed in an enclosed area

90
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,760
how many rabbits will be born if we

91
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,518
assume that

92
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,040
every month a pair of rabbits will

93
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:23,440
produce another pair

94
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:25,359
and that rabbits begin to bear young two

95
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:28,799
months after birth

96
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:31,120
that seemingly innocuous rabbit question

97
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:32,319
leads to this very powerful fibonacci

98
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,560
sequence

99
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:36,000
so the title of this talk though has to

100
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,239
do with fibonacci spirals

101
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,400
so i figured i'd better show you all how

102
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:43,360
to create a fibonacci spiral

103
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,319
so if you create a tile for each number

104
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,599
in the sequence

105
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:49,280
that's a square so one by one two by two

106
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:51,760
three by three five by five eight by

107
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:54,400
eight and so on you see that the tiles

108
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:56,399
all connect together really elegantly

109
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,120
and then if you put a quarter turn of a

110
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,920
circle

111
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,280
inside each of those squares you create

112
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:03,760
this beautiful green

113
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,200
fibonacci spiral that you see on the

114
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:08,798
screen

115
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:10,879
and it is closely related

116
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:12,480
to the golden spiral but i'm not going

117
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:14,000
to talk about the golden spiral in this

118
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,280
talk or the differences between them so

119
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,759
let's not go there

120
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,880
all right so what do fibonacci spirals

121
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:21,199
have to do

122
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:23,120
with contributing to postgres well as i

123
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:23,919
was conceiving this talk i started to

124
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,240
think about

125
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:28,000
all the different types of contributions

126
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,440
that can help drive the adoption of

127
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,960
postgres on the planet

128
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:33,040
so if we're looking to increase the

129
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,719
number of users the number of developers

130
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:38,160
the number of pull requests

131
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:39,759
the number of um consultants that work

132
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,840
in this space

133
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:43,280
the number of applications that are

134
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:46,799
running on top of postgres

135
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:48,960
well uh i i had to figure out what kind

136
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,840
how much adoption we wanted to drive did

137
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,680
we want to drive

138
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,119
exponential adoption did we want to

139
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,360
drive fibonacci

140
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,040
option and see a fibonacci curve which

141
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,720
is what you see here right this is the

142
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,680
fibonacci sequence plotted

143
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:03,840
with a linear y-axis and so that's where

144
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,720
the idea for fibonacci connecting in

145
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,039
with this talk

146
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,880
might have come from or it might have

147
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:11,840
come from the fact that i just always

148
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:14,479
wanted to put a romanesco cauliflower

149
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,198
in one of my talks now how many of you

150
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:18,240
have seen

151
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:21,199
touched or eaten one of these

152
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,759
okay so less than half the room these

153
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:23,440
things

154
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:25,280
are super cool i think they're

155
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:29,120
mathematically beautiful

156
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:29,599
they are fibonacci spirals and in fact

157
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,240
they're

158
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:34,560
also fractals so they're kind of a

159
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:37,520
double whammy of mathematical beauty

160
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,000
in one vegetable and it turns out that

161
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:41,520
there are

162
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:45,120
fibonacci spirals all over in nature in

163
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:47,359
snail shells for example in artichokes

164
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,240
underneath pine cones in the arrangement

165
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,400
of the brax

166
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,240
on the bottom of pine cones those are

167
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:55,359
all fibonacci spirals

168
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:57,280
and sunflowers um in the arrangement of

169
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,919
the seeds on the top of the sunflower

170
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,638
flower

171
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:00,960
that those are fibonacci spirals too and

172
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:04,160
i'm

173
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:06,239
even told that you can see fibonacci

174
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:08,479
in the arrangement of pigeons on

175
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,680
rooftops and how they line up on the

176
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:11,680
rooftops

177
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,919
now this part's not true and you can

178
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:16,080
thank dimitri fontaine for having me add

179
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:17,758
it to the talk and last time i did this

180
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,120
a lot more people laughed so thank you

181
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:20,960
for the people in the front row

182
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,720
who chuckle did that okay but this

183
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,318
part's not true don't don't remember

184
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,880
this part

185
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:28,319
all right so 21 ways to contribute to

186
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,840
postgres this is why we're here we're

187
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:32,080
here to talk about postgres

188
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:34,318
and really quickly why do i have

189
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,280
anything to contribute or say on this

190
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:37,039
topic

191
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:39,039
i started my career as a developer at

192
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:39,759
sun microsystems in the developer tools

193
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:42,000
group

194
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:43,440
and over the course of my career i've

195
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,479
worn lots of different hats i've

196
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,880
contributed

197
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:48,719
in many different ways i spent the bulk

198
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,599
of my career as an engineering manager

199
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,400
in the kernel group

200
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:54,000
at sun microsystems back when there was

201
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,719
a sun microsystems

202
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,720
and i've also just over 10 years ago

203
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,160
moved into product management and

204
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,479
product marketing roles

205
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,360
so i've i've seen these contributions

206
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:05,758
come from different

207
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:08,000
angles and in fact when i moved from

208
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,840
engineering over to product marketing

209
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,240
there were people friends of mine who

210
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:14,239
frankly questioned me and my choices

211
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,479
and they felt like the work i was doing

212
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:19,280
was somehow less important now

213
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:20,479
and so let me ask you this those of you

214
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:23,280
in the room have any of you

215
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:25,440
ever worked in a small software company

216
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,919
a small startup or a small firm raise of

217
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:29,039
hands

218
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:32,240
please wow more than half of you

219
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:33,360
okay so one of my lessons working in a

220
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,919
small company

221
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,440
is that it's like you're all in the boat

222
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:39,039
you're out in the middle of the ocean

223
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,639
and you're all pulling on the oars and

224
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:44,000
doing whatever it is your

225
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:45,919
role is and we all need each other every

226
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,759
role matters whether it's the person

227
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:49,520
ordering toilet paper for the bathroom

228
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,639
so you have toilet paper when customers

229
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:53,198
come to visit

230
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:55,440
or the developers uh the people in

231
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:57,039
finance making sure all the numbers work

232
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:59,199
sales people matter a lot if you're

233
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:00,960
trying to make money and if our goal is

234
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:01,759
to delight our customers we all have to

235
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,239
work together

236
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:04,800
so that's why there's this emphasis on

237
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,960
beyond

238
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,000
code which is what the next slide goes

239
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,758
ahead to

240
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,520
to pose i've already answered this

241
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:12,720
question the other thing i should point

242
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,878
out is that um

243
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,800
i joined cytus data three years ago and

244
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:18,560
situs's claim to fame is we've created

245
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,520
an open source extension to postgres

246
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,759
called situs

247
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:23,359
that scales out postgres horizontally

248
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,840
and the reason the microsoft logo is

249
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,639
there

250
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:28,719
we got acquired a year ago and so i now

251
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:30,479
work from microsoft which

252
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:33,039
10 years ago i don't know how i would

253
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:35,760
have exactly felt about that

254
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:37,439
but these days i'm actually quite happy

255
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,319
with the company that microsoft is

256
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,240
growing up to become

257
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,599
so i'm i'm pleased and i'm happy there

258
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,599
and i'm still there

259
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:45,600
all right so we talked about why beyond

260
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:47,120
code and now i just want to tell you

261
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:50,240
that when i was submitting

262
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:51,839
my talk proposal for the cfp i did a

263
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,360
quick search at the very last minute i

264
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:55,040
had it all ready to go and then i had

265
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:57,440
this little paranoid thought of

266
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,560
uh oh what if someone just did this what

267
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,720
if someone just did this

268
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:02,399
earlier this year i better check so i

269
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,800
did a few google searches and sure

270
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:05,600
enough

271
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,479
josh burkus delivered a talk back in

272
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,360
2013

273
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,080
called 50 ways to love your project so

274
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,959
those of you

275
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:15,040
who don't know josh he was on the core

276
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:17,279
team for postgres for many years

277
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,719
now he has emeritus status i always

278
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:20,959
mispronounce that word

279
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,560
and so i just wanted to give a shout out

280
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:24,239
to him because i definitely once i

281
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,719
discovered his talk i went and studied

282
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,000
his

283
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:29,360
his slides and made sure to incorporate

284
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,519
it and i wanted to say thank you

285
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:33,519
and it's been seven years so it seemed

286
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:35,920
time to have the conversation again

287
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:37,600
and make more people aware of all the

288
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:40,160
types of ways you can contribute to

289
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:42,320
postgrads to make it successful

290
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,439
and now we're just going to dive in 21

291
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:46,399
ways

292
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,360
the first way is obviously let's start

293
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:49,519
with the brain dead

294
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,720
obvious attend conferences you guys are

295
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:53,680
all here at fosdem

296
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,399
so you get that what some people don't

297
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,239
get though

298
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:57,600
is that when you go to a conference of

299
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,160
course you're focused on what you can

300
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,399
learn

301
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:01,439
what you can get out of it and what you

302
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:03,040
don't always realize

303
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,040
is that you're impacting the people that

304
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:06,640
you're talking to in the hallway track

305
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,719
let's say the two of you meet for the

306
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,959
first time and you have a conversation

307
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,240
and you share some tip that changes your

308
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:14,560
work when you go back

309
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,360
um to whatever your project is next week

310
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,599
that happens

311
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,760
all the time and it's super powerful so

312
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:22,959
that participation

313
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:25,040
matters a lot that sharing matters a lot

314
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:26,479
the second way is just an extension if

315
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:29,519
you will or a smaller

316
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,000
local example of sharing at conferences

317
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:32,480
there are

318
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,360
lots of ways to participate in local

319
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,079
meetups

320
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,560
does anybody recognize this picture did

321
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:39,920
anyone

322
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:40,880
you do where is that uh i think it's at

323
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,800
the cape but yeah

324
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:44,640
it's the kpm office i'm wearing the blue

325
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:46,560
shirt with the laptop

326
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:48,000
got it so you're in the picture you're

327
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:51,680
now famous

328
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,200
got it so this is um uh the postgresql

329
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:55,359
meetup in the netherlands

330
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:57,680
um thank you to boris and the people at

331
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:59,360
optima data for helping me

332
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:01,359
track down the photo i particularly like

333
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,279
the green floor because i've never

334
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,959
worked in an office space that has a

335
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:07,120
football field that you can play around

336
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:08,719
in you know where i work in california

337
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,880
we have ping pong tables in the office

338
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:13,120
but we've never quite had the turf

339
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:14,720
to play to play football and of course

340
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,519
we don't even call it football in the

341
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,839
states but

342
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:19,120
let's not go there and use the other

343
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:20,880
term

344
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,240
so there's obvious ways to participate

345
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:25,920
in meetups attend

346
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:28,480
give talks give feedback to speakers

347
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,959
speakers love feedback we want to get

348
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,920
better

349
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:33,518
we want to add value and so if you ever

350
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,959
have an idea about something that

351
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:36,959
somebody didn't mention

352
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:39,199
or a related point give them that

353
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:41,199
feedback but there's some non-obvious

354
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:44,079
ways to contribute to meetups too

355
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:46,000
um so if you or your company are in a

356
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:47,040
position to host a meet up like the

357
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,600
folks here were

358
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,800
that is a great and valuable thing to do

359
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,639
um the other thing

360
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:55,279
the organizers always appreciate are

361
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:56,000
when people chip in to help pay for food

362
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:58,160
and drink for the

363
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,519
evening because their attendees tend to

364
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,920
appreciate food and drink

365
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:02,560
so that's another way all right number

366
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,560
three

367
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:06,638
you can share your expertise by giving a

368
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:09,359
conference talk just like so many people

369
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:10,399
are doing here at fosdem i had to put

370
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,480
this picture up here

371
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:14,800
because their cfp just opened a couple

372
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:18,079
of days ago so this is um

373
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:20,000
postgres ibiza which um this year will

374
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:21,439
happen in june and it will be the second

375
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,240
year that it happens

376
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:26,240
uh it's called postgres on the beach and

377
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,839
i've had a few debates with people about

378
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:30,000
whether postgres on the beach

379
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:30,880
is a real conference or whether it's

380
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,279
what we call

381
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,800
in english a boondoggle do you all know

382
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:37,200
what a boondoggle is

383
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,839
it's it's kind of like a a business trip

384
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,360
that where

385
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:40,880
there's not so much business and it's

386
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,800
really more play

387
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:44,320
um it turns out this is a very serious

388
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:47,760
conference and i was talking to

389
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:49,440
one of my um teammates dimitri fontaine

390
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:51,760
and he went last year and he said it's

391
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:55,040
absolutely one of the best conferences

392
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:57,439
that he's ever been to so um heads up

393
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,399
about that cfp i think there's also a

394
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:01,760
cfp

395
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:03,440
you went also last year so maboo was

396
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:05,279
there last year and you can vouch for it

397
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:07,920
as well

398
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:08,399
okay um they're expecting to grow this

399
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,479
year

400
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:12,399
and have an even bigger following i

401
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,440
think there are other cfps that are open

402
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:14,639
right now for postgres

403
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:17,519
if that's something you've ever

404
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:18,800
considered um sharing your expertise and

405
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:21,440
your lessons matters

406
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:23,120
you do not have to be a developer who

407
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,920
works on postgres you do not have to be

408
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,839
a contributor

409
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,120
or a committer to have something

410
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:29,519
valuable to share

411
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,800
in fact user stories can make some of

412
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:32,480
the best

413
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,639
presentations so whether you're an app

414
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:37,040
developer or a dba

415
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:38,320
your experience using postgres is is

416
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:41,360
also worth sharing

417
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:42,240
i think pgday austria's cfp is also open

418
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,959
right now

419
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:46,240
am i missing any other ones opg it is

420
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:48,959
open

421
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,440
so there are germany germany that's

422
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:53,119
right

423
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:56,160
and is belgium open yet okay

424
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:58,399
all right so you can go

425
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:00,800
to the postgresql.org website they have

426
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:03,920
a list of upcoming community events

427
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:07,680
and from there you can track down

428
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:09,199
what's opening up all right and uh

429
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,638
devram i have to keep looking at my

430
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:12,639
slides because they're not displaying

431
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:14,079
here so just apologizing to you i know

432
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:16,160
that's your pet peeve you don't like

433
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:18,719
people to turn back

434
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:20,959
number four post your slides online if

435
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:23,040
you do give a talk at a meet up

436
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:25,040
maybe something in your with your team

437
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,599
and it's not confidential and it can be

438
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,079
shared

439
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,760
i cannot emphasize enough the value of

440
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:31,120
posting your slides online

441
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:33,199
by the way those of you who are on the

442
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,720
edges squish into the middle if you see

443
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:36,160
some seats next to you because where

444
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,800
people are filling in here

445
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:40,160
so please just get up squish in make

446
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,240
space

447
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:44,639
move move right yeah move towards the

448
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:46,639
brick wall over here

449
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:48,320
thank you very much for accommodating

450
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:52,880
this room is going to be full

451
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:55,760
thank you joe all right

452
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:57,600
the number of digital views that you get

453
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:59,760
for posting your slides online will

454
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:02,240
often exceed the number of people in the

455
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:04,720
room even if you have 300 people

456
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:06,560
in the room you'll still get more

457
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:09,120
digital views online in almost

458
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:11,439
all cases this is a picture of a talk i

459
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:13,279
gave last year in switzerland

460
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,639
and this is on speaker deck which

461
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:16,320
happens to be my favorite

462
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:17,920
but there's lots of other slide sharing

463
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,920
services that you can

464
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:22,000
share your slides on and of course the

465
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,319
conference sites will always ask you

466
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,320
well

467
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,240
often we'll ask you for it and they'll

468
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:28,399
post it on their websites too

469
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:31,040
most of us do that but some people don't

470
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:32,800
do it absolutely get those digital views

471
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:34,880
share your expertise with people

472
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,160
who couldn't afford to in this case make

473
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:39,120
the trip to fosdem

474
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:40,719
and come here to brussels all right so

475
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,959
then the other way you could contribute

476
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:45,600
is to start a local pg day

477
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:47,518
um i put this picture of pg day paris's

478
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,320
logo up here because it is happening in

479
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:50,639
march

480
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:52,720
and and it's happening two days after a

481
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:55,120
wonderful pg day in the nordics

482
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:57,279
which this year is in helsinki finland

483
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,399
so i went to nordic last year it was in

484
00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:00,000
copenhagen

485
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:01,680
and i felt privileged to be able to give

486
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,079
a different talk there

487
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:05,120
but paris has a warm place in my heart i

488
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:08,239
went to school

489
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:10,639
in france many years ago and so i had to

490
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,920
mention that um the thing about pg days

491
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:14,880
that's so special

492
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:16,880
is they're single track one day events

493
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,600
and so that has a couple of interesting

494
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:20,079
benefits

495
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:22,079
one is that they're just easier to get

496
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:23,279
to typically you don't have to travel as

497
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:24,880
far to get to them

498
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:26,480
and you don't have to miss as much work

499
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:28,399
because it's only a day

500
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,759
and it's also less expensive because you

501
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:31,519
don't have to travel as far and you

502
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:34,480
don't have to miss as much work

503
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:36,320
and then it's intimate like unlike today

504
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:38,000
where some of you will change rooms

505
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:40,320
throughout the day and maybe be sitting

506
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,759
next to a stranger the entire day

507
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,839
you can walk through a whole day at

508
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:45,680
fosdem and not meet anybody

509
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:47,839
i know from experience that that's

510
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:50,479
possible and it can be lonely

511
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:51,279
when you're in an intimate kind of one

512
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,959
room one day

513
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:54,720
conference you're with the same people

514
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:55,680
all day and you're way more likely to

515
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,920
meet people

516
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:59,680
and build contacts that you stay in

517
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:01,439
touch with afterwards

518
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:03,519
so for me at least that's been my

519
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,000
experience and other friends of mine

520
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:06,480
have said that

521
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,959
too i wanted to highlight pg day

522
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,599
santiago because boris mejias who was in

523
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:12,160
the room

524
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:13,359
a while ago and left he's not here to

525
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,120
watch my talk

526
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:17,760
but he first told me about pg day

527
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:19,678
santiago and it was a brand new pg day

528
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:21,839
that happened last fall in chile

529
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:24,079
and um what i thought was so cool about

530
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:26,639
it is it's the only pgday i know of

531
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:27,280
that was completely 100 in the local

532
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,760
language

533
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:30,399
so it was all in spanish catering to the

534
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,480
language

535
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:34,160
and the interests of that local postgres

536
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,880
community and i thought that was pretty

537
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:38,000
awesome

538
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:39,840
um and then pg dsf is

539
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,600
something much closer to home i'm from

540
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:43,760
california i live

541
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,959
outside of san francisco and i actually

542
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:47,280
helped to create

543
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:49,440
pgdsf working with an awesome team of

544
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:51,600
people across different companies

545
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,880
and it just happened two weeks ago so

546
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:55,120
it's still fresh we'll be doing the

547
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:57,120
post-mortem in about a week excuse me

548
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:58,479
the retrospective we don't say

549
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:00,320
post-mortem anymore

550
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,640
we'll be doing the retrospective in

551
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,600
about um a week's time once i'm back in

552
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,640
the states

553
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:08,399
and uh it's a ton of work to create one

554
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,240
of these pg days i got to tell you

555
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:12,240
i was on the talk selection committee

556
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:14,320
for it which was quite a privilege

557
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:16,160
but it's also very rewarding when you're

558
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:17,520
there and you see people meeting for the

559
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:20,080
first time and exchanging

560
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:22,000
email addresses and phone numbers and

561
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:24,000
talking about job opportunities or

562
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,679
walking away with something from a talk

563
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,520
that they didn't know about before

564
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:29,120
so it's pretty cool as an organizer to

565
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:31,039
see that happen

566
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,959
all right another way number six you can

567
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:35,600
write a blog or post an article

568
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:37,919
i know how many of you write blogs about

569
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:40,959
using postgrads or working on postgres

570
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:44,000
raise of hands okay just a few of you

571
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:45,520
all right thank you well it's

572
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,679
and i don't know why that's not showing

573
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:49,280
it pisses me off quite frankly well

574
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:52,000
that's okay those words don't matter

575
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,720
um i took a picture of something leticia

576
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,960
avro

577
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:56,480
who's one of the bouncers outside she's

578
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,760
volunteering today so she's standing

579
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,720
right outside that door

580
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:01,600
but she wrote an article for the program

581
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:04,160
magazine

582
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:05,840
in france and actually made the cover

583
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,960
which i thought was pretty darn cool so

584
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:09,439
that's why i used an

585
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,400
article instead of a blog but it's cool

586
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:13,200
because you can reach

587
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:14,480
so many more people digitally when you

588
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:17,840
do that

589
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:20,640
um all right let's go forward so

590
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:22,720
if you do write blogs then i absolutely

591
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,679
recommend that you syndicate to planet

592
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:26,080
postgres

593
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:27,520
now how many of you have syndicated blog

594
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:29,600
posts you've written two planet

595
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:31,440
postgrass please raise your hands

596
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,959
okay i know joe wants to raise his hands

597
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:35,440
steven did in the back okay

598
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:37,039
awesome thank you devram um this is

599
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:39,679
really powerful

600
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:41,600
i have published blogs my team writes a

601
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:43,360
lot of blogs about postgres and open

602
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:46,080
source and situs and

603
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:47,600
uh when we syndicate to planet postgres

604
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,240
and there's a policy for doing this has

605
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:51,120
to be

606
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:52,480
about postgres it has to be relevant no

607
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:54,239
spam of course

608
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,520
but we reach a lot of people planet

609
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:57,520

610
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:59,600

all sorts of interesting things that are

615
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,760
going on across the various companies

616
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:11,039
that work

617
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:12,080
in this space and if you don't use

618
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:14,320
twitter

619
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:16,480
you can always go to the postgresql.org

620
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:17,918
website you scroll down a bit

621
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:20,000
and there's a section on there called

622
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:21,600
planetpostgrass which has

623
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,200
you can at the bottom of it you can

624
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:25,199
click to the archives and that's how you

625
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,000
can get to the rss feed that exists for

626
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,919
it

627
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,440
and you can also get to on the right

628
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:31,679
hand column the policies

629
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:33,280
and how to get started if you are

630
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:34,000
writing about postgres and you want to

631
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,520
syndicate

632
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,280
all those instructions are available

633
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:40,240
there all right

634
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:41,280
number eight you could write a book so

635
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,520
um i talked to

636
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:45,360
dimitri about how he wrote this book the

637
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:48,158
art of postgrass

638
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:49,439
and he said that if you find yourself in

639
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:51,600
the postgres world

640
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:52,799
constantly answering the same question

641
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:55,120
over and over

642
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:57,280
or that people are constantly asking the

643
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:59,439
same questions over and over

644
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:01,678
then maybe there's a book there maybe

645
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,000
there's a a series of questions you

646
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:04,320
could

647
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,120
collate together into some structure and

648
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,840
publish it

649
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:09,360
and reach even more people and i how

650
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:11,678

675
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:54,239
the german edition sql performance

676
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,159
explained

677
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:58,880
how many of you have used or read or

678
00:21:56,159 --> 00:22:01,280
consulted with this book

679
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:02,240
all right so about another almost 10

680
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:04,158
people

681
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:06,400
one of my colleagues said that in her

682
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:07,280
first year as a developer working on

683
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,760
postgres

684
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:10,960
this was her bible it was incredibly

685
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:13,840
valuable to help her

686
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:15,200
understand how to optimize her queries

687
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:17,439
for performance reasons

688
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:19,200
so she highly recommended it and i just

689
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,400
thought i would feature it and you can

690
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:23,200
find it at sql

691
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:25,600
hyphen performance hyphenexplain.com and

692
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:27,679
again these slides are already public

693
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:29,360
okay so the next thing you can do is to

694
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:31,039
create user stories

695
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:32,879
now you don't have to work for a

696
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:34,960
postgres company like i do

697
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:37,120
to want to create customer stories or

698
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:39,919
case studies

699
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:41,760
plenty of users will write blog posts on

700
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:43,440
their own engineering blogs about their

701
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:45,760
experience

702
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:47,440
migrating their app to postgres or

703
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,960
improving the performance running on

704
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,000
postgresql and those stories are

705
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,919
valuable too

706
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,000
i suspect a lot of you in this room

707
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:56,240
probably have insights into how

708
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,760
people are using postgres and for people

709
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:00,400
who are considering it

710
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:01,840
that stuff is gold it's pure gold so

711
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:03,679
it's worth the effort

712
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:05,199
now the reason i put a picture here of a

713
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:08,080
man holding a big light

714
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:09,919
up high above a stage where people are

715
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:11,678
getting ready to do a performance

716
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:13,760
is because i feel like when you're

717
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:16,159
creating a user story

718
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,799
you have that same kind of power i mean

719
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:18,880
this guy

720
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:20,400
sitting here he's going to control what

721
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:22,960
the audience sees

722
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:24,720
where he shines the light is what their

723
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:26,159
attention is going to be focused on

724
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:28,080
and the order in which he moves the

725
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:28,960
light from this corner to that corner to

726
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:31,439
the middle

727
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:33,200
affects the audience experience and so i

728
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:35,039
when i've created user stories

729
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:37,039
that's how i often perceive of it as i'm

730
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:39,600
that that lighting technician

731
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:40,240
that's figuring out what matters and

732
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:43,039
what

733
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:45,120
um people considering postgres want to

734
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:47,360
know about and want to learn about

735
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:49,279
if you do this i have two tips for you

736
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,000
whether you work on your own open source

737
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:53,279
project or

738
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:55,200
for a company don't ever ever

739
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:56,480
outsource the interview with the end

740
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,159
user um

741
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:59,760
because then you have people just

742
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:00,400
reading off of standard templates of

743
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:02,320
questions

744
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:04,720
and they don't necessarily get to the

745
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:06,240
interesting meet and frankly sometimes

746
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,919
they're bored because they can tell the

747
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:10,960
person interviewing them doesn't know

748
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:11,760
anything about the topic the other tip i

749
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:13,679
have is

750
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:16,400
a lot of writers that you might hire

751
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:18,799
freelancers to help you write the story

752
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:20,159
their tendency is to take something

753
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:22,320
really colorful

754
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:23,200
maybe something politically incorrect or

755
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:25,279
idiomatic

756
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:27,039
that these words that people have used

757
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:29,520
and they try to make it generic

758
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:30,879
in vanilla and standard and you know

759
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:32,720
reaching everybody and that makes the

760
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:33,919
stories really boring so don't do that

761
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:36,240
either try to keep

762
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:37,120
your stories as authentic as possible to

763
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,600
the way

764
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:40,559
actual users talk about it all right

765
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:43,760
number ten

766
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:46,399
um you can use video to help

767
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:48,080
show what postgres can do and the reason

768
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:50,880
for that is some people just

769
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:52,158
learn better with video right some of us

770
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:54,000
are great with books

771
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:56,080
we're book smart right and we're great

772
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,840
reading articles reading documentation

773
00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:00,158
to figure out what we need to do

774
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:02,080
but other people need to see a demo they

775
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:03,440
need to see a screencast i need to

776
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:06,080
increase my voice

777
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:07,360
all right is that better stephanie okay

778
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:09,039
we're good

779
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:10,879
this is just a picture of a video i

780
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:12,000
helped to produce with marco slott in

781
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,919
the netherlands

782
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,039
last year so i just wanted to put an

783
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:16,559
example up there

784
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:18,720
as a way of leading you to the next

785
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:19,279
topic which is if you do create these

786
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,919
small

787
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:23,679
bite size videos like not longer than

788
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:25,279
five minutes please because nobody wants

789
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:26,720
to watch videos that are longer than

790
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:28,159
five minutes

791
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,760
just making sure you have really good

792
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:32,080
video metadata matters

793
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:33,440
it matters for people's discoverability

794
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:35,279
of it and so

795
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:37,120
um don't just include your title and

796
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:38,799
your abstract but also try to put a

797
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:40,719
couple video bookmarks in there

798
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:42,080
that will link to that special spot in

799
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:43,440
the middle which you think people are

800
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:45,360
really going to care about

801
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:46,960
and just think if somebody's watched

802
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:48,399
your entire screencast

803
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:50,559
and then they read the entire

804
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:52,240
description and they're hungry for more

805
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:54,000
be sure to put some other links at the

806
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:55,520
bottom which i don't know if you can see

807
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,440
in the back there

808
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:59,600
but just put a little green check mark

809
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:01,279
next to them link to whatever they can

810
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,719
get to next so they can keep learning

811
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:03,760
more about whatever your open source

812
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:05,919
project is or

813
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:07,120
whatever your product is all right

814
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:10,480
number 11

815
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:13,199
if you build it they will not come but

816
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:14,240
boy oh boy am i so happy for the word of

817
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,320
mouth that surrounds

818
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:17,840
fosdem because all of you are here today

819
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:19,760
so thank you for coming

820
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:21,039
and by the way if you do see an empty

821
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:23,360
spot next to you please

822
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:24,720
after he's done squish over so you make

823
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,639
more space

824
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,919
you have to promote what you've created

825
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:30,880
so whether you create

826
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:32,400
videos or blog posts or new extensions

827
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,840
maybe you've created a new repo on

828
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:36,159
github

829
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:37,199
you do have to make people aware of it

830
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:39,200
what i found

831
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,480
is that people in my inner circle you

832
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,960
know the people i work with

833
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:44,960
every day maybe who sit next to me um

834
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,679
some of them are super helpful to also

835
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,600
help me

836
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:48,799
share spread the word and some of them

837
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,559
don't want to help

838
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:52,639
some of them just aren't comfortable

839
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:54,559
doing that they feel like it's too

840
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:56,159
self-promotional when they work really

841
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:59,120
closely with me

842
00:26:56,159 --> 00:27:00,880
and so what i've experienced is it's my

843
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,678
secondary network like friends of

844
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:04,240
friends

845
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:06,159
or acquaintances who are even more

846
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:08,080
generous and help spread the word

847
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:09,600
and create word of mouth around whatever

848
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:12,720
projects i'm working on

849
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:13,120
which i think is fabulous all right so

850
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,880
now

851
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:17,039
promote on twitter how many of you use

852
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:20,240
twitter

853
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:22,480
okay so about half of you um i think

854
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:23,840
it's an incredibly great place to learn

855
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:25,200
about postgres

856
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:27,360
there are a bunch of accounts like

857
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:30,159
planet postgres that i mentioned earlier

858
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:31,840
this is a picture of the postgresql

859
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:33,279
twitter feed which is the community

860
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:35,840
twitter feed

861
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:36,320
that went live i think sometime about a

862
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:38,559
year

863
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:41,120
year and a half ago and so i think

864
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:42,720
there's almost 16 000 followers here now

865
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:44,320
if you're not following it yet this is a

866
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:46,000
great place to hear about the latest

867
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:48,799
announcements of postgres

868
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,440
but if you work with postgres one way to

869
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:51,600
contribute

870
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:53,760
is to share some of your learnings and

871
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:55,918
your epiphanies and your perspectives

872
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:57,120
and your lessons on twitter if you just

873
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:58,799
read a great article

874
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:00,559
that you're recommending to the person

875
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:02,480
next to you on your project

876
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:04,080
why not tweet about it and include that

877
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,919
link and let people know

878
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:08,399
and again that helps to spread the word

879
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:10,399
and feed this whole growing ecosystem

880
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:11,600
and i think you all know that postgres

881
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:13,520
is growing

882
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:15,678
last this is a small room this year last

883
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:17,840
year we had a room that sat 300

884
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:18,960
and we filled it by the second and third

885
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:22,080
talks of the day

886
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:22,720
so and what db engines database of the

887
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,559
year

888
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:25,919
two years in a row but not this year

889
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:28,158
unfortunately

890
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:31,039
but there's lots of evidence of some

891
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:33,840
significant growth in this space

892
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:35,279
this might be number 13 the most

893
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:36,720
important thing you can do

894
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:38,480
to help contribute to the growth of

895
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:40,640
postgres which is that when you're

896
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:42,480
working in this space say thank you

897
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:44,240
i don't think i do this enough i think

898
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:47,679
lots of us don't do this enough

899
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:49,679
um if you like somebody's work praise it

900
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:51,039
and especially if they're junior

901
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:52,720
especially if they're new

902
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:54,480
especially if they're they're stumbling

903
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:55,200
along and making the mistakes that we

904
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:57,919
all make

905
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:59,520
especially when we were new i put this

906
00:28:57,919 --> 00:29:01,600
example of a tweet up there

907
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:03,679
from a postcrest engineer named louise

908
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:05,360
graujonk who lives in paris

909
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:06,880
and she had gone to a meet-up in new

910
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:09,279
york city and

911
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:11,200
saw sam bale's talk and really really

912
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:13,279
liked it on foreign data wrappers

913
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:15,279
and so instead of it would have been

914
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:16,399
wonderful if she had just gone up to sam

915
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:18,080
and said that was great

916
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:20,320
i really appreciated this part in this

917
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:21,039
part and i'm going to use them in my job

918
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,799
this week

919
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:25,039
but she went even further and tweeted

920
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:26,960
about it and kind of raised awareness

921
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:28,240
probably drove a bunch more followers

922
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:30,159
for sam on twitter

923
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:31,440
and recommend that recommended that

924
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:33,679
people go to sam's talk

925
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:35,200
at the next um conference where sam was

926
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:36,240
presenting and i thought that was a very

927
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,720
generous gift

928
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:40,000
and i think we we just need to help each

929
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:42,480
other and one of the benefits

930
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,640
is that when that person in this case

931
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:45,760
sam is having a bad day or running into

932
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:47,600
obstacles well

933
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:49,440
they have this and all these positive

934
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:51,918
experiences to fall back on

935
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:53,440
all right number 14 how many of you know

936
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:56,960
that the messages to

937
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:59,440
are translated okay

938
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:01,039
a small number i felt like seven hands

939
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:02,320
eight hands went up

940
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:04,240
i didn't know that either in the

941
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:06,320
beginning i think it's awesome

942
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:07,520
there's a whole bunch of people who are

943
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:10,000
actively working

944
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:11,679
on translating the postgres messages

945
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,840
into all sorts of languages

946
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:17,000
and this is a screenshot of a website

947
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:19,279
called called get this

948
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,799
bobble.postgresql.org i put the url

949
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:22,480
right over there on the right

950
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:24,000
it's of the current status i took the

951
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:26,399
screenshot last night

952
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,840
and if any of you speak multiple

953
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:29,360
languages which i'm guessing

954
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:31,678
let's just ask that question how many of

955
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:33,360
you speak more than english

956
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:35,679
okay there you go i knew i was in the

957
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:37,360
right place that is absolutely a way

958
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:39,200
that you can contribute and if you're

959
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:40,959
just getting started with postgres

960
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:43,279
and you want to make a contribution now

961
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:45,200
but maybe you're not ready to do it

962
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:46,320
in some other areas this is a great way

963
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:48,240
to get started

964
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:50,158
so um there are instructions in the

965
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:52,159
postgres documentation about how

966
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:54,240
translators can do it and there's no

967
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:56,480
code involved

968
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:58,000
it's weird on the wiki it's called

969
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:00,000
national language

970
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,159
support and on the documentation it's

971
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,000
called native language support

972
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:05,679
so i don't know just it's native

973
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,159
language support in the documentation

974
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:08,480
you can

975
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:10,240
google for that there and find it but

976
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:12,799
this is an awesome way to help

977
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:14,240
now another way to help is to report

978
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:17,039
bugs with postgres

979
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:18,000
this is super valuable i know there's a

980
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:20,559
tendency among

981
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,399
human beings to sometimes feel like

982
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:24,240
someone's already reported this bug

983
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:25,840
i can't be the first one to run into

984
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:28,080
this this is so

985
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:30,000
obvious that probably hundreds of people

986
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,879
have already reported it i don't need to

987
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,600
report it

988
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:35,200
but absolutely you should because you

989
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:37,360
don't know that and oftentimes other

990
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:39,279
people haven't reported it

991
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:40,719
the turnaround time in the postgresql

992
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:43,200
team for fixing things

993
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:44,799
is pretty impressive i have been told of

994
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:47,279
instances where bugs were

995
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:48,720
literally fixed within an hour of having

996
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:50,720
been reported

997
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:52,720
more likely it will be considered as a

998
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:54,880
candidate for the next patch release

999
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:56,720
patch releases are every quarter and

1000
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:59,840
then the major releases for postgres

1001
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:01,679
are every year so you know if it's

1002
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:02,879
something sizable an impact maybe it

1003
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:06,080
would be a candidate for

1004
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:08,320
a major release but people feel

1005
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:10,000
in the core team and um in the

1006
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,960
contributor community that these bug

1007
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,360
reports are gold

1008
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:14,080
and we absolutely want people to do it

1009
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:16,399
so how do

1010
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:17,279
you submit bug reports where do you

1011
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:19,120
submit them

1012
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:20,720
well you could just send an email to the

1013
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:24,719
mailing list and

1014
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:26,480
it's pgsql hyphen bugs

1015
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:28,799
on the mailing list that's one option

1016
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:31,679
you can also fill out a form

1017
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:33,440
that i think i don't show a picture of

1018
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:34,799
but you can fill out a form

1019
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:36,640
that you can find on the webpage and it

1020
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:38,639
will in turn mail the mailing list now

1021
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:40,559
there is a very important caveat and joe

1022
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:42,480
is looking at me he's got his eyes

1023
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:44,559
looking at me right now so i i think

1024
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:47,519
he's hoping that i'm going to say this

1025
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:48,480
if the bug has security implications of

1026
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:50,399
any kind

1027
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:51,919
then you probably don't want to report

1028
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:54,399
it using that process

1029
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:56,000
don't use the mailing list and don't use

1030
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:58,239
the form because that effectively

1031
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,519
makes it public if there are security

1032
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,640
implications you can check the

1033
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:02,159
documentation

1034
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:05,240
and you'll find that you should mail it

1035
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:06,559
more privately to security at

1036
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:08,480
postgresql.org

1037
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:10,559
got it is that good get a thumbs up on

1038
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:12,720
that one all right very important

1039
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:13,918
all right number 16 submit corrections

1040
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:16,559
to documentation

1041
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:17,919
i have talked to some pretty serious

1042
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:20,240
postgres engineers

1043
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:22,080
where this is the very first way that

1044
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,799
they participated and contributed to the

1045
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:25,039
community

1046
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:26,158
and it can be as simple as a typo that's

1047
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:28,000
worth fixing

1048
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:29,919
um because you know when there are typos

1049
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,919
people think maybe the rest of the

1050
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:34,000
you know the technology might have

1051
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:34,559
mistakes in it and so we like to fix

1052
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,519
those

1053
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:39,678
um my thing that i tend to notice is a

1054
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:41,760
lot of times people will use language

1055
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:43,519
that seems super clear can only be

1056
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:44,320
understood in one way but in fact it's

1057
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:46,080
ambiguous

1058
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:48,399
and there are multiple interpretations

1059
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:49,760
for it so if you see any ambiguities by

1060
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:51,840
all means submit

1061
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:53,360
corrections to them so that we can get

1062
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:54,959
those things fixed

1063
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:56,479
and of course if there's anything in the

1064
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:58,000
documentation that makes you hit your

1065
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,559
head against the wall at one in the

1066
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,919
morning

1067
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:02,080
when you're trying to figure something

1068
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:04,159
out and you just can't find the answer

1069
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:06,559
that's absolutely worthwhile to submit

1070
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:09,520
to now at the bottom

1071
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:10,800
of every documentation page you'll see

1072
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:12,719
something that looks like this

1073
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:14,000
so just scroll down to the bottom says

1074
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:16,158
submit correction

1075
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:18,159
and it welcomes you to submit it and

1076
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:20,159
there's a forum that you link to

1077
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:21,440
and i tried to make it in a narrow

1078
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:21,839
mobile mode so you could see the whole

1079
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,040
thing

1080
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:25,119
but then you could just fill in that

1081
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:28,399
form provide your comment and uh

1082
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:30,800
take it from there all right number 17

1083
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:32,638
stickers our thing okay so i can see

1084
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:34,159
that federico has lots of stickers on

1085
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:35,520
his laptop i don't know if you guys can

1086
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:36,960
see mine

1087
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:38,879
i'm just going to lift it up and show

1088
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:39,760
you that it's got a ton of stickers on

1089
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:41,839
it

1090
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:44,800
how many of you have pristine laptops

1091
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:47,440
that are untouched by stickers

1092
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:48,960
oh my goodness so about 15 maybe 20 of

1093
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,760
you and how many of you have lots of

1094
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:53,679
stickers

1095
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:56,159
come on all right so slightly fewer

1096
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:56,960
i will tell you that where i work in

1097
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:59,440
california

1098
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:00,800
stickers are absolutely a thing and one

1099
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:02,160
of the things that i think so you can

1100
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:03,920
see the postgres sticker down at the

1101
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:05,520
bottom i actually just picked that up at

1102
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:07,839
the pg day on friday

1103
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,560
that happened here in brussels um at the

1104
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:10,640
hilton

1105
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:12,480
and that's an event that precedes fosdom

1106
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:14,319
every year and if you're interested in

1107
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:16,720
postgres i recommend you go

1108
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:18,240
next year there are about 125 people

1109
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:21,919
there if i remember correctly

1110
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:24,160
and i'm just single day single track

1111
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:25,920
uh all about postgres anyway so that's

1112
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:26,879
where i picked that sticker up but i was

1113
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:30,079
on a train

1114
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:31,599
coming home a while ago and somebody saw

1115
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:33,200
my laptop because i worked on the train

1116
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:34,960
i hot spot my phone and

1117
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:36,799
i was just cranking along all in my own

1118
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:37,359
little world and this this man leaned

1119
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:40,800
over

1120
00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:42,240
and he said do you work at cytus data

1121
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:44,079
so this was this must have been right

1122
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:46,240
before the acquisition i guess and

1123
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:48,560
uh and so it led to this wonderful

1124
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:50,078
45-minute conversation all about situs

1125
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:51,200
and scaling out postgres and the

1126
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:53,280
extension and

1127
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:54,879
and it was a pretty fabulous experience

1128
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,359
and i've heard that echoed by other

1129
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,960
people

1130
00:35:55,359 --> 00:35:58,880
they'll be in coffee shops and they'll

1131
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:00,240
have a postgres sticker and somebody

1132
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:01,200
will come up and start talking to them

1133
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,640
about it

1134
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:04,480
so if you don't like people and you

1135
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:05,680
don't want to talk to people maybe it's

1136
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:08,400
not for you

1137
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:09,919
but i i think it's fabulous and and in

1138
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:12,079
fact at the end of my talk i do have

1139
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:14,240
some of our cool alicorn stickers that

1140
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:16,720
link to our open source repo

1141
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:17,520
if you're interested in that okay so

1142
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:19,279
number 18

1143
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:20,960
use your design skills oh my gosh i got

1144
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:23,040
to speed up

1145
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:25,119
graphics and visuals pull people in so

1146
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:27,359
this is that ellie corn that i mentioned

1147
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:28,160
that we make stickers of we use an ellie

1148
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:30,078
corn because

1149
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:31,200
postgrass of course the beloved symbol

1150
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:33,520
is the elephant

1151
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:35,439
and at situs we felt like we made the

1152
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:38,000
elephant magic by scaling it out

1153
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:41,280
horizontally so we combined the elephant

1154
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:44,160
with the unicorn and that's its history

1155
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:44,800
um another example of using design is in

1156
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:48,160
louise

1157
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:50,240
gronjong's crocodile so um she gave a

1158
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:52,000
fabulous talk at a bunch of postgres

1159
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:54,479
conferences over a year ago

1160
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,280
about a deep deep talk about postgres

1161
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:57,839
indexes

1162
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:58,720
very heavy hitting but she used the

1163
00:36:57,839 --> 00:37:01,680
notion of

1164
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:02,959
cleaning crocodile's teeth as a theme to

1165
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:04,560
kind of connect the dots

1166
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:06,079
on all of her conversations about

1167
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:08,880
postgres indexes

1168
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:10,800
and it it got people in the room she had

1169
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:12,880
a crowded jam-packed room

1170
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:15,280
it also kept them awake they weren't

1171
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:17,119
bored like the the storyline and her

1172
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:18,800
connections were very creative

1173
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:20,480
and then here's another example of using

1174
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:21,920
design to help grow the postcrest

1175
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:24,000
community

1176
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:25,680
i just gave one of you a postgres

1177
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,520
activity book he's holding it here

1178
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:29,200
i have about 10 more with me that i can

1179
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:31,920
share but it's it's a

1180
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:33,279
book full of coloring pages and puzzles

1181
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:36,079
geared at kids although

1182
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:37,520
adults like it too and it's just about

1183
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:39,520
promoting postgres

1184
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:41,280
so there's a page on multi-tenancy and

1185
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:42,560
there's a page on analytics and there's

1186
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:44,320
a page on discovery

1187
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:46,400
and they're all kid-friendly but they

1188
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:47,760
might foster a conversation between you

1189
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,640
and your kids about well what is

1190
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:51,440
postgres

1191
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:51,759
and what is a database and mom dad what

1192
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,839
do you

1193
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:55,280
what do you actually do at work anyway

1194
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:56,960
so um they're pretty fun

1195
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:58,960
and they've been very popular and

1196
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:00,640
they're not heavily branded at all i

1197
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:01,359
think on the back we put with love from

1198
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:04,160
our team

1199
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:06,400
at microsoft but that's it um so those

1200
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:08,879
are examples of using your design skills

1201
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:11,839
um now the other thing that i've seen

1202
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:13,680
more and more is people at conferences

1203
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:15,040
people who maybe don't like to write are

1204
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:16,240
not going to publish blogs they're more

1205
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,920
like bullets people

1206
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:19,118
that's how they like to communicate

1207
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:20,000
they'll create these things called

1208
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:21,520
sketch notes

1209
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,599
where they'll put together a few bullets

1210
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:25,280
of the few main takeaways of a talk

1211
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:26,800
they'll put little doodles on it and use

1212
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:29,599
some color and it's

1213
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:30,320
very effective so this is from an

1214
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:32,640
engineer

1215
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:34,800
at octa the security company named david

1216
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:36,160
neal or reverend geek on twitter

1217
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:38,079
and i'm just waiting for him to come to

1218
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:38,640
one of my talks and create a cool sketch

1219
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:41,440
notes

1220
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:43,040
of one of my presentations um the thing

1221
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:44,880
that's interesting is there's a designer

1222
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:46,880
i know named christina wadkie

1223
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:48,079
in the san francisco bay area and she

1224
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:50,160
teaches a user

1225
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:51,599
experience class for interaction

1226
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:54,160
designers and

1227
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:55,040
just general user experience and she did

1228
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:57,680
a small a b

1229
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:58,480
test it's not statistically significant

1230
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:01,200
but where she

1231
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:02,000
she gave one set of students um the

1232
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:04,000
assignment

1233
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,079
of creating a sketch note at the end of

1234
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:08,000
each chapter of learning in that course

1235
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:09,599
it was a semester-long course i believe

1236
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,119
and the other set of students did not

1237
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:12,839
have to create a sketchnit

1238
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:14,880
and the students who had to create the

1239
00:39:12,839 --> 00:39:17,040
sketchnotes perform better

1240
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:18,720
significantly on their grades for the

1241
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:20,079
class for that semester which i thought

1242
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:21,598
was kind of interesting

1243
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:23,760
and it might connect to the fact that

1244
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:25,839
using paper and pencil helps people

1245
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:27,520
retain information or in this case paper

1246
00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:30,240
and marker

1247
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:31,680
all right so number 20 evangelize at

1248
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:33,680
your local university

1249
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:35,440
now this picture was actually the room

1250
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:37,359
at fosdom last year

1251
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:39,839
um so it was as you can see it was

1252
00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:41,520
bigger and devrem gandus standing over

1253
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:43,040
here is actually the photographer and he

1254
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:44,160
posted this on twitter thank you very

1255
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:46,960
much for sharing

1256
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:47,520
um so i didn't have a good picture of

1257
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:49,359
people

1258
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:51,119
giving a talk at their local university

1259
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:52,240
about postgrass or maybe going back to

1260
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:53,920
their alma mater

1261
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:55,359
talking about how they use postgrads or

1262
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:58,400
what they're working on with it

1263
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:59,119
but if you are this is a fabulous way to

1264
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:01,119
contribute

1265
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:03,119
and in fact it probably will change the

1266
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:03,760
trajectory of some of those students

1267
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:05,359
careers

1268
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:07,119
because it's the things that people get

1269
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:07,759
exposed to in college that often

1270
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:09,839
influence

1271
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:11,599
that first project that they join or

1272
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:13,440
that first job that they take

1273
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:15,839
so thank you deborah for the wonderful

1274
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:16,560
photograph and then the 21st way you can

1275
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:18,319
contribute

1276
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:20,000
is just once you are part of the

1277
00:40:18,319 --> 00:40:21,520
postgres community which you've come to

1278
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,119
my talk you're now all part of the

1279
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:25,759
postgres community

1280
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:26,720
make people feel welcome i often feel

1281
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:29,359
like

1282
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:31,279
being welcome is one step one more

1283
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:32,160
positive step further along than just

1284
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:34,400
being open

1285
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:35,520
so if you have an open door anybody can

1286
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:37,839
walk in right that's

1287
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:40,000
open but if they have the courage to

1288
00:40:37,839 --> 00:40:41,920
walk in if they know they can walk in

1289
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,680
and when you're welcoming when you make

1290
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:45,280
sure people know that hey we're in here

1291
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:46,960
come on in we want you to join when you

1292
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:48,319
invite people to join when you make sure

1293
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:49,920
they got the invitation

1294
00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:51,680
well that's just a much more positive

1295
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:54,480
feeling and i have to say that

1296
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:56,160
everybody that i've met and i work with

1297
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:57,359
in the postgres community does a good

1298
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:59,920
job at this already

1299
00:40:57,359 --> 00:41:02,000
i just think we need to keep doing it

1300
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:03,760
alright so that's the summary of 21 ways

1301
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:06,319
to contribute to postgres

1302
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:07,440
beyond code i hope i've given you some

1303
00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:09,680
good ideas

1304
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:10,960
of things that you can do if you're just

1305
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:13,040
getting started with postgres

1306
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:15,680
ways that you can share your lessons

1307
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:18,800
learned your pain points your expertise

1308
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:21,680
and i also hope i've given you

1309
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:23,599
some understanding of let's say you are

1310
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:24,879
a developer let's say the way you want

1311
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:27,040
to contribute to postgres

1312
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:27,920
is in code i hope i've given you some

1313
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:30,400
understanding

1314
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:31,599
and appreciation for the other types of

1315
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:34,240
skills that we need

1316
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:34,960
in order to keep growing this community

1317
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,799
and

1318
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:38,800
raising awareness of how awesome

1319
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:39,839
postgres is and before i end i had to

1320
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:42,160
put up one more

1321
00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:43,440
amazingly awesome fibonacci spiral

1322
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:45,839
obviously of a

1323
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:47,920
snail shell and this actually had two

1324
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:49,759
fibonacci spirals in it so i try to draw

1325
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:52,400
them in in pink and white

1326
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:53,599
and i want to say thank you very much

1327
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:55,599
merci

1328
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:56,640
and i don't know how to say the dutch

1329
00:41:55,599 --> 00:42:00,400

limited edition situs data ellicorn

1340
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:22,640
socks with me

1341
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:24,000
that i thought given that this is an

1342
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:26,560
open source community

1343
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,920
you would appreciate i also have like i

1344
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:30,960
said some cool

1345
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:33,440
situs alicorn stickers and i have about

1346
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:34,800
10 of those postgres activity books so

1347
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:37,280
those of you with young kids

1348
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:38,400
might might get a kick out of those so

1349
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:40,560
you have seven more minutes

1350
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:41,760
i have seven more minutes so i have time

1351
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:44,799
for questions

1352
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:50,000
um if any of you have questions

1353
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:50,000
so i could put that up again all right

1354
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:54,720
why did i choose 21 because 21 is part

1355
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:57,760
of the fibonacci sequence

1356
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:58,240
that's exactly why i picked 21. so and i

1357
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:59,760
also

1358
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:01,839
wanted to go a little bit deeper than

1359
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:03,440
josh did he had 50 which meant he went

1360
00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:03,839
really really really fast and covering

1361
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:05,920
them

1362
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:07,359
and he did cover more ground but i

1363
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:08,079
wanted to talk a little bit more about

1364
00:43:07,359 --> 00:43:09,200
each of them

1365
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:12,160
otherwise i would have picked the next

1366
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:12,160
number in the sequence

1367
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:27,839
how do you think

1368
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:35,680
okay let me answer the question the

1369
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:36,399
question is i'm going to repeat it for

1370
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:38,879
the video

1371
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:39,440
um do i feel like situs data has slowed

1372
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:41,359
down

1373
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:44,000
in shipping new releases of our open

1374
00:43:41,359 --> 00:43:46,240
source software since we were acquired

1375
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,760
um and i suspect if you asked me that

1376
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:48,479
question in the first three four months

1377
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:50,400
last year

1378
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:52,079
i would have wholeheartedly said yes we

1379
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,960
slowed down a little bit we were a bit

1380
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:54,560
distracted

1381
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:56,400
right we had a lot of transitional

1382
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:58,960
things that we had to quickly figure out

1383
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:00,000
um we have been continuing to ship new

1384
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:03,440
releases though

1385
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:07,040
so i think 9.0 9.1

1386
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:09,200
8.5 what 912

1387
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:11,040
soon there will be a 9-2 what we haven't

1388
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:12,799
been doing is publishing the release

1389
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:14,800
notes or the blogs as effectively

1390
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:16,720
so i was just in amsterdam a couple days

1391
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:18,880
ago talking with the engineers

1392
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:19,759
the lead engineer for our situatis open

1393
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:22,000
source offering

1394
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:23,280
and we agreed on a plan to get more of

1395
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,720
those release notes published

1396
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:26,960
so you'll see more of them you'll even

1397
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:28,640
see some retroactively if i have my way

1398
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:30,319
because there's lots of great stuff in

1399
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:32,000
there and then we'll go deep into some

1400
00:44:30,319 --> 00:44:34,800
of those new features that are insidis

1401
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,800
open source too

1402
00:44:34,839 --> 00:44:37,839
what

1403
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:41,520
all right any other questions

1404
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:48,000
what's the biggest cytos cluster in

1405
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:50,800
production and how much data it has

1406
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,520
what is the biggest situs cluster in

1407
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:53,839
production

1408
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:55,759
and how much data does it have that's a

1409
00:44:53,839 --> 00:44:58,960
really good question i'm not sure i know

1410
00:44:55,760 --> 00:45:01,040
the exact biggest i do know of

1411
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:02,000
a customer that i just wrote a blog post

1412
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:03,920
about myself

1413
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,280
where there's one and a half petabytes

1414
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:07,599
of data in

1415
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:08,480
the cluster and i think it's about 44

1416
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:12,079
nodes

1417
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:14,800
um i know of another open source

1418
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:16,720
customer again more than a petabyte of

1419
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:20,000
data

1420
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:20,879
probably about 40 notes um i if you give

1421
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,319
me your

1422
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:23,920
email address at the very end or

1423
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:25,359
something i'd be happy to send you a

1424
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:27,599
link to some of those blog posts

1425
00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:30,799
deborah i know i mean i heard something

1426
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:32,960
from such people more than 100 clusters

1427
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:33,839
or more than 100 nodes you mean i know

1428
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:34,720
the actual number but i don't want to

1429
00:45:33,839 --> 00:45:37,359
attempt it right now

1430
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:39,118
okay yeah so i'm i'm telling you about

1431
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:41,598
some of the biggest ones that i know of

1432
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:43,119
size wise oh i do know of another one

1433
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:45,040
more than a petabyte and that's more

1434
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:47,119
than 80 nodes in the cluster

1435
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:48,480
so i've now talked about heap i've

1436
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:49,359
talked about packs i've talked about

1437
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:51,040
microsoft

1438
00:45:49,359 --> 00:45:53,839
interestingly there's a customer at

1439
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:56,079
microsoft who was our user of cytus open

1440
00:45:53,839 --> 00:45:59,599
source before we were even acquired

1441
00:45:56,079 --> 00:46:00,480
and he runs it on azure our pex customer

1442
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:03,440
runs cytis

1443
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:05,280
on google cloud obviously we have now

1444
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:07,200
integrated situs into azure database for

1445
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:08,640
postgres so it's a fully integrated

1446
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:10,720
built-in deployment option so some

1447
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:12,960
people do it that way too

1448
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:13,919
and a heap has a published customer

1449
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:16,480
story theirs

1450
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:17,440
is a sizable deployment and they manage

1451
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:22,160
it themselves

1452
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:22,160
on aws other questions

1453
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:26,960
i see the nls for italian is very bad so

1454
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:29,359
i think i will pick up

1455
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:30,079
that is wonderful okay so he just made

1456
00:46:29,359 --> 00:46:31,598
my day

1457
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:33,520
um those of you who didn't hear what he

1458
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:35,760
said he can he sees that the native

1459
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:37,440
language support for italian is very bad

1460
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:38,880
and so he's gonna roll up his sleeves

1461
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:40,720
and start contributing

1462
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:43,040
that is awesome you made my trip to

1463
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:46,240
brussels worthwhile

1464
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:48,079
thank you and we all know italian is a

1465
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:51,200
really wonderful magical language

1466
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:52,960
it's crazy or crazy

1467
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:54,560
espenzanico says it's the common

1468
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:56,560
language but we speak any sort of

1469
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:58,400
language in any part of italy so

1470
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:59,680
but i'm quite fortunate because i live

1471
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:02,319
in tuscany which

1472
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:02,799
is the place where italian is supposed

1473
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:06,400
to be

1474
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:09,200
born and it's still spoken in the way

1475
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:10,880
of the uh so i don't know if you guys

1476
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:12,399
could hear federico but he's talking

1477
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:14,000
about all the different dialects and all

1478
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:16,480
the different crazy ways

1479
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:17,920
people speak italian in italy and he

1480
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:19,440
lives in tuscany so if you're ever in

1481
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:20,400
tuscany and you want to talk postgres

1482
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:23,839
now you know

1483
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:25,839

1484
00:47:23,839 --> 00:47:27,839
questions
