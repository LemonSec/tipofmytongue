1
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:11,679
okay

2
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:13,280
so now we have uh timo niguera

3
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:16,720
brockmayer who's talking about the

4
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:18,720
admissions api um

5
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,799
yeah thank you for letting me speak here

6
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,160
at fosdem and present our project

7
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:25,199
emissions api

8
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:28,320
um to add a little suspense

9
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:29,519
to the presentation i changed the title

10
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,359
a little bit

11
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:32,960
emissions api or how to get engaged in

12
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:35,040
public interest

13
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,399
um because i wanted to take into account

14
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,839
a little bit of our origin

15
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:40,879
story how we got to make this project

16
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,879
because i

17
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:44,399
found it interesting to share with

18
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:46,079
people um

19
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:47,600
afterwards we also get a little bit into

20
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,719
the details of the data

21
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:53,840
and the technical aspects um but

22
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:55,920
first i want to show you what public

23
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:58,399
interest tech is about

24
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,239
because we first got in touch with the

25
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:02,719
public interest take

26
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:04,559
when we heard about a call from the

27
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:07,680
prototype fund in germany

28
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:12,158
that is a federally funded

29
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,159
program that lets developer

30
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:17,600
a small prototype of of a project they

31
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:20,320
they want to develop

32
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,520
and they propose this framework of

33
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,679
public interest take

34
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,839
it is basically very broad and simple to

35
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,920
understand concept

36
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:31,280
that you develop technology that

37
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,159
serves the public good so it adds a

38
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,840
little bit to this

39
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,600
floss idea that software is not only

40
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,759
open source and libre but it also

41
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,119
has some kind of social meaning for for

42
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:43,200
the society

43
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:46,640
and we as developers as a small

44
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,240
group of colleagues we found that very

45
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,399
interesting and we were immediately

46
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:53,520
hooked by this idea because

47
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:56,000
we always found that well

48
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,960
it's nice that we know technical stuff

49
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,880
because of our

50
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,240
day jobs but somehow we would like to

51
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:03,280
also put it in use to

52
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:06,079
solve problems that maybe have a meaning

53
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,799
deeper than or that it goes further

54
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:10,000
along than

55
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:13,360
uh than just the technical aspects but

56
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,319
more solves problems of society as well

57
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,959
and so we we really like this idea and

58
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:19,119
we said well

59
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:21,360
we just want to apply to this to this

60
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:24,720
call to this call to this funding call

61
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:28,319
and we're going to pitch an idea and

62
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:30,959
the first ideas we had uh was

63
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:33,040
well have you heard about the satellite

64
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:36,800
sentinel 5p

65
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:38,400
that has emissions data and and

66
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,000
we had heard of it and we thought well

67
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,680
that's really cool there's open data

68
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,440
about emissions we want to

69
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,120
build some cool tools with it where you

70
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:48,079
can maybe um

71
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,080
analyze policy

72
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:55,120
policy effects uh on uh emissions

73
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,920
and maybe build some cool visualizations

74
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:59,040
and

75
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:00,958
um so this the sentinel 5

76
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,400
satellite they provide a lot of data

77
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,560
products for emissions

78
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,599
it's a program from the asa from the

79
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,959
copernicus

80
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:11,280
program um and it's

81
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:12,239
basically spectrophotometric

82
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,280
measurements

83
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:19,840
uh where they where they can

84
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,840
analyze the the wavelength and then

85
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:27,599
then they can calculate the

86
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:30,720
concentrations of trace gases and

87
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:33,760
emissions emission

88
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:37,040
data so uh

89
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:38,480
we were then uh had some ideas what you

90
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:42,319
maybe could do with this so

91
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:44,720
we were uh thinking about maybe

92
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:45,679
tracking ships at sea because there are

93
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,799
no sensors

94
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:51,360
and ships to use a lot of heavy fuel

95
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:53,680
oils and there will be supposedly

96
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,599
a reduction in internal national ban on

97
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:58,640
heavy fuel oils to reduce

98
00:03:55,599 --> 00:04:01,119
sulfur dioxide emissions and

99
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,920
we thought well maybe we can check that

100
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,439
um

101
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:08,559
or think of maybe

102
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:12,079
diesel bands in city centers

103
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:13,760
and and we could just verify how

104
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,478
policies would influence actual

105
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:19,120
emissions um

106
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:19,680
only that we very quickly realized that

107
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,560
it's

108
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,280
not that easy you can just take this

109
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,880
data

110
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:28,479
and analyze it easily and put it maybe

111
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:31,280
in some visualization

112
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:31,919
so we uh for well this is open but it's

113
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:35,359
not really

114
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:37,120
easy to access so uh

115
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,479
the good thing is that it's there so

116
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:42,080
this is really awesome

117
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:43,599
we we can we can access this data and we

118
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,758
also don't have to do all this

119
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,199
fancy analysis of the spectral analysis

120
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:50,720
so uh

121
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:53,919
the asa already gives that to us it's

122
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:56,960
pre uh pre-processed data and

123
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:57,520
um the problem that we realized is that

124
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,599
it's

125
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,799
backed in binary data sets that are not

126
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:04,320
really uh

127
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:07,759
too easy to uh employ in a program

128
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:08,560
or in a an interactive visualization for

129
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:11,919
example

130
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:13,440
so these are nc files it's a scientific

131
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:15,680
data format

132
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,719
and you when you filter this data you

133
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,440
get uh

134
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:21,600
chunks of files that represent one

135
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,600
flyover of the whole satellites

136
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,960
so if you are interested in a region you

137
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,199
also have to do a lot of

138
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,479
processing from from the data that you

139
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:30,800
already pre-filtered

140
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:32,080
it's pretty large files and also

141
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,680
generally there's a lot of data

142
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,758
processing involved beforehand

143
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,840
so we took a step back and that was

144
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:38,240
actually when when emissions api was

145
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:41,198
born

146
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:43,440
so when we came up with this idea we

147
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:46,800
need public infrastructure for open data

148
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:48,479
we need an easy access to this satellite

149
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,800
based emission data

150
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:51,680
and we wanted to build an infrastructure

151
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,680
service

152
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,600
that provides this data that takes it

153
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,400
from the isr does some pre-processing

154
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,520
and gives it

155
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:02,638
to a user who wants to to

156
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:05,758
use this data in a more easily to to

157
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:06,319
employ format also we see ourselves a

158
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,600
little bit

159
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:10,720
ourselves a little bit as a data

160
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:13,600
literacy project uh because

161
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:15,120
satellite data is not that i'll come to

162
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:19,600
that later but there are a lot of

163
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:21,120
um um peculiarities that maybe you would

164
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,560
not expect when you just think

165
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,639
of a satellite you think well there's a

166
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:27,360
lot of data around it's pretty dense

167
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:28,720
and you can maybe make some nice

168
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,960
visualizations but

169
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,840
there are also some constraints that are

170
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:35,599
important to know

171
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:36,560
um yeah so i would uh like to take a

172
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,240
dive into this

173
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,600
uh into the more technical aspects of

174
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,319
the data um

175
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:44,160
how does this work the satellite

176
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:47,520
actually flies over the earth and

177
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:49,599
produces scan lines so you can you can

178
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,799
think of it maybe as a flatbed scanner

179
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:54,960
for the earth

180
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:58,880
uh and uh you actually get

181
00:06:54,960 --> 00:07:01,120
uh so you get a continuous picture

182
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,319
of uh the earth around the orbit of the

183
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:05,360
satellite

184
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:07,360
and this when you

185
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:09,440
get one of these data sets one of these

186
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,560
files and you just plot the data it's

187
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:14,560
something like this

188
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,560
so uh here you can already see

189
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:19,919
some some general aspects of this data

190
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:21,440
first of all we filled it for germany

191
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:24,318
here but you get a lot of

192
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,960
africa of the antarctis as well and you

193
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:28,840
get

194
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:32,479
nothing for example of the north pole

195
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:35,039
um this is simply due to the fact that

196
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:36,960
the satellites are based so the

197
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:38,719
measurements are based on light

198
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,400
and there's no active light source on

199
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:43,680
the satellite so

200
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:45,599
it needs to have sunlight to

201
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,280
get data so you you will never get data

202
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:50,080
at night for example

203
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:51,758
um also you can maybe see that there are

204
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:54,000
some holes or that it's not

205
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:55,280
as smooth as as you would expect the the

206
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,080
line in general

207
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:59,679
um everywhere where there's clouds you

208
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:03,039
don't have data

209
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:05,120
uh and this is just uh some

210
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:06,960
some of the things so now that when you

211
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:10,400
think of um

212
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:12,878
how the satellite flies over the earth

213
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:14,159
you don't have a measurement for each

214
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:16,879
time of day

215
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,599
in every place but you actually get this

216
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:19,440
line that

217
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:20,800
moves over germany in this case here for

218
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,919
example

219
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,560
and you see where you have the

220
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:27,359
measurements so

221
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:29,199
for germany it's a time window of maybe

222
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,720
let's say 10 minutes

223
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:32,800
where the satellite is passing germany

224
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:36,159
and you just get data for that time

225
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:39,519
at that location so when you want to

226
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:40,159
for example measure emissions during

227
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,919
rush hour

228
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:43,679
and the satellite is not there during

229
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:44,480
that time you simply don't have data

230
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:48,640
about that so

231
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:51,279
you cannot have comparisons over one day

232
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,279
for example

233
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,200
um these are some of the important

234
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,240
things to consider

235
00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:01,279
about the data uh now i'm going to

236
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:02,800
switch to the technical side and our

237
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:06,240
architecture

238
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:10,959
what we did we downloaded the data

239
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:13,839
from asa we pre-process it in a way

240
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:14,079
that we can use it more easily we cache

241
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:17,279
it

242
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:20,560
in a way or we save it in a postgres

243
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:24,640
database and we will provide a service

244
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:28,319
as a rest interface where you can query

245
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:31,839
by region by by time and

246
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:33,920
you get a json in return that you can

247
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:35,360
usually pretty easy pretty easily put

248
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,360
into one of your

249
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:40,560
usual javascript frameworks for example

250
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,560
for visualization

251
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,399
i have to say that we are doing this

252
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,360
since

253
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:47,920
since september and we are now in a

254
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,680
state

255
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:54,079
where it kind of works you can check out

256
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:56,959
our homepage in our ui

257
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:58,560
we have a working prototype at the

258
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:59,199
moment we only have the carbon monoxide

259
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,199
data

260
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,640
in our database because it is what we

261
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,680
started with because what easy

262
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:08,480
it was easy to get going with it uh and

263
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:09,760
uh we still need to add some more of the

264
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,079
other products

265
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:13,600
uh we have a lot of examples already on

266
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:15,040
our homepage where you can see how to

267
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,800
use the data how maybe to make

268
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,599
visualizations with this data that we

269
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,160
have

270
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,720
and of course we also needed to develop

271
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,120
some

272
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,959
tools around this service and one of

273
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:28,160
them the sentinel 5dl is a

274
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:29,839
download library that is on pipeli where

275
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:32,480
you can

276
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:33,360
filter and download sentinel 5 data

277
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,000
automatically

278
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,519
it already works quite well so if you

279
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,880
just want to think around

280
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:43,360
yourself you can also use some of our

281
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,360
libraries

282
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:49,760
for some examples how uh the the query

283
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,360
would work so here you have a

284
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:53,920
curl uh command with uh with the query

285
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,959
of

286
00:10:53,920 --> 00:11:00,319
our api you can filter by country

287
00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:03,439
or uh you can also put your own polygon

288
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:06,880
into it and by days

289
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:09,279
and you get a get a json format with

290
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:10,320
the values you can then plot this this

291
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:13,600
is for example

292
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:16,959
just february in

293
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:20,640
germany february 2019

294
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:24,880
and the average for each day so

295
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:27,519
you can like like this you can easily

296
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:31,120
make comparisons for example between

297
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:33,600
measurement days um then you can

298
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:35,040
plug it into your favorite uh

299
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:38,320
visualization here

300
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:41,120
we did an example with deck gl that

301
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,600
just kind of looks cool because you have

302
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,480
the

303
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:46,320
3d effect and you see the different

304
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,839
areas in germany

305
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:51,920
and their missions at that point when

306
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:51,920
the flyover was taking place

307
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,320
well we still have a lot of challenges

308
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:00,720
to resolve

309
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,760
uh we realized during the process

310
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,560
obviously that this is

311
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:05,680
way too much data we somehow need to

312
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:08,319
reduce it we are

313
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:10,239
currently playing around with uh

314
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,040
geospatial indexing systems but maybe

315
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:14,480
somebody else

316
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:16,800
has a better idea how to do it um

317
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:18,560
we also need a long-term host currently

318
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:21,760
we get some credit from

319
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:23,760
amazon from aws and

320
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:25,600
we also have some universities that are

321
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:28,399
interested in hosting our project

322
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,440
but we still need a solution that has

323
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:32,560
enough power for

324
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:34,320
for long for long term as well

325
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,920
and of course we need to import more

326
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:38,399
emission data

327
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:40,959
more of the other products from from the

328
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:40,959
satellite

329
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:47,360
yeah so this is our story

330
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,959
of getting involved in public interest

331
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:52,079
take

332
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:54,719
for us from that point of view

333
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:55,279
uh the real interesting takeaway was

334
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,120
that there

335
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:58,959
is a lot of interesting data out there

336
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:01,760
but usually it's just very

337
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:02,479
difficult to access and we probably need

338
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,959
a lot more

339
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,160
people to get working on this

340
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:10,479
infrastructure

341
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:12,000
to build actually infrastructure that

342
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:15,040
comes before building a

343
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:18,720
building a tool or visualization
