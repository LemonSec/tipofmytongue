1
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:11,200
good afternoon everyone

2
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:12,960
um my name is pia grunovalt i

3
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,200
am a project officer from old digital

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:18,560
and i'm really happy to be here at

5
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:20,320
uh foster it's my second year here

6
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,919
and my first year doing a presentation

7
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,039
and the reason why i'm doing this is to

8
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:26,400
talk about

9
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:28,720
our project on open adult education

10
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,400
uh in terms of open adult education i

11
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:31,840
should be clear that

12
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,079
i'll give an introduction about our

13
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:36,079
network and what we do but in terms of

14
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:39,840
adult education we focus on

15
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:41,920
upskilling and reskilling uh adults with

16
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:45,840
little or no skills to be ready for the

17
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:48,480
digital transformation

18
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,680
just about what we do so at all digital

19
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:53,120
we support about

20
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,719
43 now of europeans with insufficient

21
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:57,680
digital skills

22
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:59,359
and we are an organization that started

23
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,640
from the grassroots up so we were

24
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:04,000
founded a little bit over

25
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:06,560
then ten years ago by

26
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,680
organizations based in cities like here

27
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,240
in brussels we have

28
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,159
florian here with us today who's one of

29
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,600
our who represents one of our member

30
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:15,520
organizations but we have member

31
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,600
organizations all across europe

32
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,880
that work with really bridging the

33
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,600
digital skills gap

34
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,798
with uh excluded disenfranchised

35
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,960
communities

36
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:27,360
and they decided to form the

37
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:29,360
organization after realizing that

38
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,280
there's much challenges to be had at the

39
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:33,360
european level on the

40
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,880
on bridging the digital skills gap so

41
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,520
they formed us in terms of

42
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,798
uh originally we're called telecenter

43
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:41,200
europe and now we're

44
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:42,799
uh we change the name to all digital we

45
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,560
have different focus areas in terms of

46
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:47,200
basic digital skills

47
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,720
employability and entrepreneurship uh

48
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,119
coding

49
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,000
digital media literacy and steam skills

50
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:55,280
for society

51
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,759
and a lot of the projects we do are

52
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,479
erasmus projects some horizon projects

53
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:01,520
uh

54
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:04,719
in doing these areas now going to

55
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:06,479
open adult education i'll actually go to

56
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:10,000
uh

57
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:12,000
this slide here so in 2017

58
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,160
in our member surveys we came up we

59
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,720
realized there were a

60
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,599
few challenges and that our members

61
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:21,040
needed to find

62
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:23,440
new approaches to teaching basic digital

63
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:26,000
skills to different

64
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:28,000
cohorts across the population so it

65
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,400
needed to be more modular and adaptable

66
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,879
to

67
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:33,200
address immediate needs and we also

68
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:35,280
wanted to take into account more mobile

69
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,359
and open source free and open source

70
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,440
technologies and solutions

71
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,040
i'm sure as you probably are aware a lot

72
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,720
of the digital inclusion sector got a

73
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,760
lot of support from proprietary

74
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,720
organizations

75
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:49,840
and that support has been cut a lot but

76
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:51,200
also proprietary organizations prepare

77
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,640
propose a big challenge for

78
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,799
disenfranchised communities because

79
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:57,119
you're locking people into a software

80
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,239
right from the get-go and many of our

81
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,560
organizations are

82
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:02,080
realizing that and making full

83
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,519
transitions to free and open source

84
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,159
technologies

85
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:08,560
and we needed create better training

86
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:10,480
modules to address that need

87
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,920
and we also needed to focus on new

88
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,640
digital skills

89
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:17,200
and use digital different standardized

90
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:19,359
frameworks like digicomp edu

91
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,238
at the european level i mean we're here

92
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,879
in brussels

93
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:24,959
we're not a strictly european

94
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:28,480
organization but there are various

95
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:29,440
uh international frameworks being used

96
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,480
in terms of

97
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:36,000
identifying core competencies to

98
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:37,920
teach digital skills and also to

99
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,599
identify what skills are missing and

100
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:43,760
lacking so

101
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:46,798
the open

102
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:49,920
ae project open adult education project

103
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:51,440
is addressed to teaching high quality

104
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:54,159
skills and competencies to

105
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:56,079
educators and so we're talking about

106
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:57,760
people working in digital competency

107
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:00,480
centers

108
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,120
people working in libraries so they can

109
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:04,319
have

110
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,640
a series of modules to train themselves

111
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:07,679
in

112
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:11,359
and also bring this up to their

113
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:14,159
uh and end users so adults interested in

114
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:17,199
reskilling and upskilling

115
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:19,279
i'll go back down here so

116
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:20,880
we're developing a curriculum we have a

117
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:22,559
curriculum already developed and we have

118
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,159
a toolkit on open

119
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,560
technologies that are mapped according

120
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:30,160
to digicomp edu so we use digicomp

121
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:31,360
as a area which we identify what skills

122
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,880
educators need

123
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:37,840
and we use and with our consortium that

124
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:39,360
are a few organizations very adept in

125
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,119
free and open source technologies we

126
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,840
identified resources

127
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,639
and different modules and softwares that

128
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,919
we can use

129
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:49,520
to train e-facilitators or digital

130
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:53,280
educators

131
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:56,240
we're about to start piloting a

132
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:58,400
with 10 at least 10 e-facilitators in

133
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,479
four different european countries

134
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,880
using this curriculum and this open

135
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:05,758
modular

136
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:08,400
toolkit and then we'll produce

137
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:12,800
guidelines on transferability

138
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:12,799
so they saw the project outputs again

139
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,638
and so we have the toolkit and we're

140
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,720
also going to use um

141
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:20,800
slide wiki if anyone is familiar with

142
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:23,840
that in terms of creating

143
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:27,440
courses for

144
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:28,799
educators and such before we started and

145
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,840
this is also one reason why i brought

146
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,479
florian here

147
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:34,719
is that one of the reasons why i really

148
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:36,960
wanted to come to foster is we wanted to

149
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,880
raise awareness to the free and open

150
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:42,400
source community to developers

151
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:45,120
about what is the need to bridge the gap

152
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,638
um in terms of how free and open source

153
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,120
technologies can better really

154
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:50,960
reach the most vulnerable in society and

155
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:53,759
the people who are most at risk of being

156
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:56,799
locked into a proprietary software

157
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:58,240
and we conducted desk research in all

158
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,639
four countries where this

159
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,600
project will be piloted in so in here in

160
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:05,199
belgium

161
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:07,199
in switzerland in spain and in italy

162
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:08,319
with e-facilitators understanding the

163
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,520
challenges and

164
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:11,360
the results of this cultural and

165
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,318
professional contrast between the two

166
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,319
main effects

167
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:16,080
on one side educators and the general

168
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:19,280
public have superficial knowledge

169
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:20,400
and awareness on open culture topics and

170
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,080
resources

171
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,560
and on the other side there's also

172
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:26,000
lacking structural support and promotion

173
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,800
that has pushed the creation of many

174
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
networks

175
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:31,520
and organizations to independently cope

176
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,520
with its deficiency

177
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,880
and we really want to bridge that gap

178
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,639
and promote that dialogue and that's

179
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:39,919
also why we're here today

180
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:41,280
and the main tangible

181
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:42,799
effects that we can observe in the

182
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,679
presence of this market as a huge number

183
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,520
of free

184
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,120
and open source technologies maybe

185
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,639
florian would like to speak about his

186
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,400
experience and tell a little bit more

187
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:53,440
about the organization here

188
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:56,080
hello everybody my name is florian

189
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:58,000
my english is not perfect but my ideas

190
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:00,000
are simple so i suppose it will be

191
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,479
enough

192
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,160
i'm working with max it's a non-profit

193
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:08,240
organization working in

194
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:11,759
two poor parts of brussels molumbak

195
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:15,039
and anderlecht and we are working in

196
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:19,360
digital inclusion with adults and with

197
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:19,360
young children children and

198
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:25,758
and why we are participating at this

199
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,359
project

200
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:28,960
it's because we realize that the

201
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,520
animators that

202
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:33,280
are working with us most of them they

203
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:37,280
don't have a low

204
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:39,758
low level of education they have a basic

205
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:41,840
basic education but not always a good

206
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:44,960
diplomas and

207
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:46,159
they have a lot of knowledge but we

208
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,960
realize that

209
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:50,560
they can be very good animators because

210
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,878
they know

211
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,840
better the way of thinking of simple

212
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:56,479
people

213
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,280
of this part of the city because they

214
00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:00,318
are simple

215
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:02,400
people like me i'm a simple person also

216
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:03,440
and but it make a normal relation with

217
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,758
the

218
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:08,560
the people who are learning uh and it's

219
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:12,080
easy so we have people also wearing uh

220
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,080
i don't know uh

221
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:21,039
the muslim person the woman also and

222
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:23,440
this kind of things we try to work with

223
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:26,800
peers

224
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:27,199
but we realize that this e facilitators

225
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,360
don't

226
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:30,160
have a big knowledge about the open

227
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,080
source

228
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:34,479
[Music]

229
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,680
way of thinking and the tools it's not

230
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:38,719
something

231
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:41,199
normal for them and so we try to take

232
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:43,919
this opportunity to professionalize

233
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,040
to professionalize better the the work

234
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:48,319
they are doing

235
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:51,439
with this kind of tools and

236
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,160
why why we we are choosing this

237
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,080
direction

238
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:56,160
it's mainly we thought three reasons i

239
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:59,600
want to share with you

240
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:01,360
the first one is it's about collective

241
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:04,320
intelligence

242
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,640
that the people who are in the classroom

243
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:09,279
have

244
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:13,439
knowledge they have competences

245
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:14,640
they have needs and what we try to do is

246
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,480
to

247
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,160
to understand the needs they have but

248
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:22,000
also to start from the

249
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:25,120
the power they have to to be open to

250
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,680
the knowledge they have but also uh

251
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:29,120
to the way of thinking uh that's the the

252
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:32,239
first thing and i think that

253
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,839
open source tools can help especially uh

254
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:36,800
to develop

255
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,399
this kind of things and the second thing

256
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,880
for

257
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:44,399
e-facilitators is that they

258
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:45,120
not always consent about the tools they

259
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:48,000
are using

260
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,880
and the consequence about using these

261
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,480
tools

262
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:55,760
so for instance we are still using a

263
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:59,279
microsoft uh you know

264
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:02,839
we have two digital open space

265
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:05,120
running with 15 computers another

266
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:07,120
connection

267
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,160
and we are in a network with all these

268
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:11,200
open

269
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:14,000
digital open spaces of brussels as

270
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:16,160
together in a network and no we are

271
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:19,040
thinking about a

272
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:20,240
curriculum this one to propose this

273
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,560
curriculum to all

274
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:24,560
multimedia animators working in this

275
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:27,760
field in brussels

276
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:28,880
uh and so the the second idea i wanted

277
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:31,839
to say about the tools

278
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:33,439
is that we will we would like to pro to

279
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:36,720
make possible a choice

280
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,920
that the person knows why he's using

281
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,000
these tools

282
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,760
and when if what are the consequence

283
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,480
about the tools because of course the

284
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,880
tools will

285
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:47,040
have an impact about the results but

286
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:50,160
also an impact on the end

287
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:51,279
on the one who's using the tools and the

288
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,439
way of working

289
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:54,959
of these tools will not be the same way

290
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:58,480
of working

291
00:10:54,959 --> 00:11:01,920
uh of private tools of a private license

292
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:03,519
and to also we think it's a interesting

293
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:07,040
way of uh

294
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:10,240
of promoting uh the fact of

295
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:11,839
working together but with the with the

296
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:14,560
use of the tools i'm not sure

297
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:15,519
to be very clear but it's more to think

298
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,079
and it's the third

299
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:20,320
ideas i i wanted to share with you it's

300
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:23,359
to think about uh

301
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:26,839
about the culture of participation uh

302
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:29,839
and in the in a culture of participation

303
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:29,839
uh

304
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,839
actually you by you found a lot of

305
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:36,959
things in the

306
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:40,320
floss culture as common work

307
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:40,319
to share the resources

308
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:46,239
not one person decide for the others uh

309
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,320
well you have a lot of things who who

310
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:51,120
can be maybe useful

311
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,079
uh for us but that's it and i i give

312
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:55,200
back the

313
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:58,239
the i the question to the

314
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:00,399
to everybody or to pia

315
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,839
i'm very interested in hearing some

316
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:03,600
questions from the audience but one of

317
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:07,040
the things we want to promote here

318
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:08,800
is also the concept of free culture and

319
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,680
collaboration and collaborative

320
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:13,359
knowledge

321
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:15,199
so while max they sometimes speak very

322
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,600
lowly of themselves and say we still use

323
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:19,440
microsoft we still use these tools

324
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,440
but the idea is also teaching people

325
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,480
about licenses teaching people about

326
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:26,240
copyleft

327
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:28,880
how they can create their outputs to be

328
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,360
open so it can be reused by other people

329
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,839
and they're

330
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:33,600
excellent at that the so we want to

331
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:35,040
share that open culture and make people

332
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,200
realize that

333
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:38,079
it's not necessarily strictly the end

334
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:42,320
tools

335
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:45,120
but how you use them in your daily life

336
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,839
and if anyone has questions or comments

337
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:49,200
or

338
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:51,440
challenges uh please raise your hand we

339
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:55,519
have a lovely assistant here who's gonna

340
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:57,760
send over your mic a microphone to you

341
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:57,760
yes

342
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:05,359
hi i just want to ask you said you have

343
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:06,720
your curriculum in slide wiki is that

344
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,800
correct okay

345
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,320
so if i understood correctly what the

346
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,399
curriculum we are currently developing

347
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:14,959
is something like a train the trainers

348
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:16,639
so you're is that correct yes okay and

349
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:19,680
what kind of language do you have

350
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:23,680
so far oh um so this

351
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:26,959
will be in english french italian

352
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:27,279
and catalan a little bit also in spanish

353
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:30,319
and

354
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:31,920
dutch and this is also one reason why

355
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,639
we're starting to pilot in april because

356
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:35,040
it takes a

357
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:36,480
long time to translate it in that many

358
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:39,839
languages

359
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:41,920
and with the slide wiki tools once we

360
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:44,079
we have it closed but once it's open

361
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:47,199
it'll be open for everyone to

362
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:48,880
use the slides in their education

363
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:50,319
it's not open yet but once piloting

364
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:52,480
starts it will be open uh

365
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,839
