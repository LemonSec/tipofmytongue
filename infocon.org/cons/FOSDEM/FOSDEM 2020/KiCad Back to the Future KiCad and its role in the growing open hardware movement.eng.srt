1
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,879
hey

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,760
thanks everybody uh thank you for coming

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,280
i'm gonna do something a little

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,639
different this year in the past i've

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,360
done a lot of uh

6
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:16,480
state of the union with keycad this year

7
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,160
i'm just going to ask if you want to

8
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,520
keep track what's going on with key cad

9
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,480
go out and look at the version 6 road

10
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,919
map

11
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,760
works in progress now so we've been

12
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,720
working on that i want to talk a little

13
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,640
bit about

14
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,919
i've been kind of musing in my mind

15
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,640
about

16
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,599
how key cad's role has helped the open

17
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,280
hardware movement and

18
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:34,960
where we're going with that in order to

19
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,160
do that we've got to go all the way back

20
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,559
to the beginning of the open source

21
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,319
heart

22
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:39,680
software movement and see how that

23
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,640
progressed and i think what you'll

24
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:44,079
notice is for i look around i don't see

25
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,480
a lot of people in this room older than

26
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:47,120
i am

27
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,919
so there's probably a lot of you won't

28
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,599
remember

29
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,840
some of us you know where we started

30
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,719
with the open source software movement

31
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,800
you're going to see a lot of

32
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,360
similarities in the open source hardware

33
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,919
movement

34
00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:00,320
even though it's much much earlier stage

35
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:02,320
of that so

36
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,840
in the beginning before there was

37
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,760
anything that resembled a personal

38
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,479
computer people worked on mainframes and

39
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,159
everybody sat

40
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:09,760
terminals and it was connected the

41
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,119
mainframe and the only time you worked

42
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,240
on software was

43
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:14,640
when you were connected to that

44
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,158
mainframe so software development back

45
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,040
then was the only people that worked on

46
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,799
software

47
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,439
software collaboratively were people who

48
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:24,479
either worked for the government

49
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:27,439
uh universities or large large

50
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:29,520
corporations like ibm so

51
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:31,839
but it was pretty obvious even back then

52
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,520
in the very early days of computing that

53
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:36,479
software copyrights were coming so the

54
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:39,840
big companies lobbied the major

55
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:41,600
uh governments in in 1964 cop software

56
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,040
copyrights were recognized in the us and

57
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,320
pretty much everybody else

58
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,560
follow the rest of the world followed

59
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:48,720
suit pretty quickly okay

60
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,159
so there was kind of a lull there while

61
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:53,119
they were still sorting out

62
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:55,119
the microprocessor world so the small

63
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:57,200
8-bit micros

64
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:58,240
that were in design between the early

65
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,200
60s

66
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:02,560
into the early to mid 70s it took a

67
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,920
while so

68
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,920
there wasn't really any software

69
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,040
development open to the what you would

70
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,640
call the general public

71
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,440
right by the end of the 70s the pc was

72
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:14,000
starting to

73
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,879
take root so these startup companies of

74
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,319
uh

75
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:19,920
apple and the ibm at least their pc in

76
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:22,399
this area right

77
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:24,079
so early really early in this movement

78
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,840
only only enthusiasts went out and

79
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,280
bought computers for personal use right

80
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,640
nobody else had them they weren't on

81
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,080
everybody's desktop

82
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:32,319
everybody's now they're in everybody's

83
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,319
pocket so

84
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:35,760
there was a lot of sharing of code early

85
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:36,640
on people would say hey look at this

86
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,079
thing i made and

87
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,000
they'd there would be like these

88
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,360
conferences like this where

89
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,959
got you know people who were writing

90
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,239
software for computers would meet up and

91
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:46,319
share ideas

92
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:48,480
but it didn't last very long because

93
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:49,518
this grew so fast that people realized

94
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,280
that well there's money

95
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:53,200
there's not just money to be making made

96
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,599
selling software for mainframes there's

97
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:59,518
money to be made for selling software on

98
00:02:55,599 --> 00:03:02,159
personal computers um

99
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:03,200
so the that rushered in the dark ages

100
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:05,200
basically

101
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,958
once the sharing stopped all the

102
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,599
licenses went proprietary there was

103
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:10,239
there was

104
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:11,280
no longer any concept of open source

105
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:13,920
software at all

106
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,599
um they were restrictive proprietary

107
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,559
you've we've all seen those licenses

108
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:19,679
before

109
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:21,680
they've been around for you know decades

110
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,959
early on even commercial software

111
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,120
quality was not

112
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:26,080
what it is i mean today i thought if

113
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,480
you've never used

114
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,159
if you're never part of this and having

115
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,560
to live with because you lived with this

116
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:32,798
because

117
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,000
software distribution was by me some

118
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:35,519
media hard media like

119
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,200
there was no internet it was either a

120
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:39,120
floppy disk or some other

121
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,319
you know that was how software got

122
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,319
distributed

123
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:43,920
so bugs persisted until you upgraded to

124
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:45,760
the next version right so you had to buy

125
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,040
the next version upgrade to get the bugs

126
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,518
fixed but then there was always some new

127
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,920
bugs

128
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:51,120
that came with the new features right

129
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,879
some of the things that also happened

130
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:56,159
during this time that was not

131
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:58,000
very nice was work working applications

132
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:59,200
were purposely broken for competitive

133
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,959
advantage

134
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,958
i won't call anybody out but if you know

135
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,799
the history of that you know who did

136
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:06,560
do did those kinds of things and

137
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,439
basically if you were a user a software

138
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,360
user like

139
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:11,439
like i was during this time you kind of

140
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,200
felt like you kind of felt like

141
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:14,640
that you were just an afterthought you

142
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,159
know it didn't feel like they had your

143
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,238
best interest at heart

144
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,680
so what happened is a large group of

145
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:20,880
professional programmers were kind of

146
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,400
getting frustrated

147
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:25,040
with this whole idea of proprietary

148
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:29,599
software

149
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:32,960
and so in 1980

150
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:34,720
the bsd released the first what we now

151
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:37,120
know what we now know as the first

152
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,000
truly open source license right and mit

153
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:42,160
followed uh

154
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:44,800
not long after that um in the mid 80s

155
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,320
so most of this was done at the

156
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,240
university level most of the

157
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,360
open source software was done by uh

158
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,880
educators and

159
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:54,720
and um their the staff right

160
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:57,440
but there was a couple of big time

161
00:04:54,720 --> 00:05:00,479
projects during this period that were

162
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:02,960
um because because of the permission of

163
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:04,479
permissiveness of these licenses

164
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,000
they were the pro there were two

165
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:09,039
projects that comes

166
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,160
to mind bsd sockets and kerb ross and

167
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:12,400
they were hijacked

168
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,440
and then you know the point of those two

169
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,719
projects was to

170
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,479
unify things right we were going to

171
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,120
bring everybody together right well they

172
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:20,240
were

173
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:23,199
broken for competitive advantage and so

174
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,960
a group group of people realized that

175
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:27,440
these licenses were

176
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,080
not necessarily the spirit of these

177
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,199
licenses

178
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:32,960
was always to to make your code freely

179
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:36,639
available but it didn't

180
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:38,638
specify that so later in the 80s

181
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,759
the new project was formed and they

182
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:42,400
released the first

183
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:43,680
version of the gpl right and so that

184
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,840
opened up the

185
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:48,080
the foundation so the gnu project worked

186
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:51,198
on all the core tools compilers

187
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:53,359
librarians they basically

188
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:54,240
had clean room versions of all the unix

189
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,000
tools that

190
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,280
people had used in back in the days

191
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,919
right

192
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,638
and what helped what helped um spur that

193
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:02,318
was

194
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:05,360
the internet right the early internet

195
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:07,360
even the good old dial up days of 19.2 k

196
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,120
and your your phone line would scream at

197
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,080
you when you you know you logged on to

198
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,600
it

199
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,800
it was a way for people to collaborate

200
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,000
and things started to grow pretty

201
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:17,440
quickly at this point

202
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,919
okay so now things were so we still lack

203
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:22,240
the kernel so in 1991 some guy from

204
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:25,440
finland created a kernel under the

205
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:27,520
under the gpl2 okay

206
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:30,000
and that that really spurred development

207
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:32,159
things really took off at this point so

208
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,280
within a couple of years by the mid 90s

209
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,319
there were

210
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:39,039
probably a dozen packaged distros of

211
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:41,520
of linux so you had red hat and debian

212
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:43,759
and mandrake and

213
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,960
susie and so there was a whole bunch of

214
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:46,560
them so you didn't even need to

215
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,080
do any compiling anymore you could

216
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:51,599
download install and and

217
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:53,440
run linux and this is when i got in

218
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:55,360
i'm sorry just i'd like to move around

219
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,479
this is this is when i started getting

220
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,720
involved in key

221
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:59,758
in in open source development and at the

222
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,680
same time

223
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:03,680
right around this same time there's some

224
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,280
guy a professor

225
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,039
named jean-pierre scherra that worked at

226
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,880
a university in

227
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:10,479
france started working on a project

228
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:12,240
called keycad okay so

229
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:14,479
that's how old key keycad goes back to

230
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,080
the very very you know just when

231
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:18,159
the whole open source thing was really

232
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,758
starting to take off

233
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,280
what really changed the tide was

234
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:22,560
high-speed internet access once

235
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,880
high-speed internet

236
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,479
net access became readily available the

237
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,680
effective cost of distributing the

238
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:30,479
software went to zero

239
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:32,000
right so now open source was really

240
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:32,880
development was kind of in full swing at

241
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,080
this point

242
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:37,680
um by the late 2000s

243
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,280
the small form factor devices and

244
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,360
smartphone industry

245
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:43,679
it was everywhere now you could you

246
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,120
couldn't hardly use a device without

247
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,479
touching open source software you may

248
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,680
not have known that you were using it

249
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:50,800
but you were using it

250
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:53,199
so at this point floss won

251
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,160
you know we basically it's there's not

252
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:57,360
any

253
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:58,960
debate here about whether or not floss

254
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:02,400
was the dominant

255
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:04,878
development model for software right

256
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:06,479
but also during this time we started to

257
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:09,039
see hardware design tools

258
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:10,479
um key cad projects start when even

259
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:12,800
though it was always public it was never

260
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:16,240
really publicly developed and we

261
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:18,720
that that was happened in the in the

262
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,319
late 2000s group groups of people

263
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,160
started actually working on key cad to

264
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:24,400
collaborate and improve it

265
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,400
okay

266
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:31,199
so also during this time

267
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,640
there was some move so now we had some

268
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:33,919
tools and they weren't

269
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,598
super powerful compared to the

270
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:36,718
commercial hardware development tools

271
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:39,519
but we had them

272
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:40,399
so we were starting to see some growth

273
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:43,200
in

274
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:43,679
the idea of open hardware because people

275
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,920
wanted

276
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:47,680
the same arguments for open source

277
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,199
software you could almost make for open

278
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,959
source heart or open hardware

279
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,480
you know it's freely available you can

280
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:54,239
learn you can extend it

281
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,760
there's lots of good reasons to do that

282
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:59,040
right

283
00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:01,200
so what happened here was

284
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:03,199
the cern released their open hardware

285
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,120
license in 2011 and they also

286
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,040
joined the keycad project because one of

287
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,440
their thing one of their mandates is is

288
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,360
their

289
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,200
intellectual property is part they want

290
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,480
to be public and they realize that if

291
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,680
they were going to use a proprietary

292
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,000
piece of software

293
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:17,359
well how open was it it technically

294
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,560
their hardware designs were open

295
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,760
practically

296
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:22,160
less so okay so that's why they joined

297
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,720
and

298
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,519
started to help make key cad functional

299
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,360
so

300
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:28,800
during this time that it's it's pretty

301
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,399
obvious from some of the talks that open

302
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:33,839
source design tools are

303
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:37,200
increasing in power usability um

304
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:41,040
in some cases they're um

305
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:43,600
approaching a lot of commercial products

306
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,959
so as you see there's an interesting

307
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,640
thing here that

308
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,800
recently board vendors have been

309
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,600
supporting key cad board files directly

310
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,479
you don't have to go through the

311
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,560
processing step

312
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,920
of you know generating gerbers and the

313
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:57,279
old the way we've done it for

314
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:59,120
you know 40 years now so obviously we're

315
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:01,519
having some influence there

316
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:03,120
in in in the hardware space because

317
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:04,959
people would otherwise because if

318
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,320
there wasn't enough reason to do so they

319
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:08,719
wouldn't so that's

320
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:11,360
that's kind of where we are at the the

321
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:13,040
moment so

322
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,480
what also happened at the same time

323
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,319
which was really interesting and i

324
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:19,600
honestly didn't see that one coming was

325
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:23,120
risk 5 development so we now have

326
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:25,120
an open in the last few years risk 5

327
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:27,279
has been implemented by quite a few

328
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:31,120
people so this is an open

329
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:32,160
um taped out part and a design for

330
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,640
people to build upon

331
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:36,399
right that i think that's the i don't

332
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:38,560
think you can undercut the significance

333
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:40,480
of how important that is because

334
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:42,000
you know we're getting open heart we're

335
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,360
getting open boards and open electronic

336
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,120
circuits designs but

337
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:47,279
we really don't there's still things we

338
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:50,079
don't know about our electronics right

339
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:50,720
that's all hidden from us and if you

340
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:52,719
like in

341
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,399
the past the hardware was always kind of

342
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,959
approached as well it's a black box

343
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:58,880
you just have to trust that it works but

344
00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:00,560
given the last few years like

345
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,399
with things like spectre and meltdown we

346
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,119
now know that our black boxes might have

347
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:06,959
problems

348
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:09,920
and so one of the things i'd like to see

349
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:10,880
happen is dye level development tools

350
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,760
start to be

351
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:14,000
opened and moved moved in and moved into

352
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:17,600
like

353
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,120
key cad for development so now

354
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,720
i'm not naive enough to believe that the

355
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,600
hardware will quite be the same way as

356
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,360
the software because

357
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,560
obviously the cost will never be zero

358
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,680
for hardware there's always going to be

359
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,880
some cost

360
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:29,439
involved but well one of the questions i

361
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,680
have is

362
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,279
well will the will the stack from top to

363
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,959
bottom ever be fully open

364
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:36,480
and i i don't see the reason why it

365
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:37,680
can't be i mean there was going to be

366
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,519
resistance just like there was

367
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,920
resistance to open source software back

368
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:44,160
in

369
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:45,599
when it was developed so so

370
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,519
the only thing that's left is is will

371
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:50,639
the cost of that

372
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:53,680
determine how the rate of um open

373
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:55,600
open hardware and you can see like it's

374
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,800
we've all so you think about 1980 as the

375
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,720
first open source

376
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,839
license software license that was 40

377
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,320
years ago

378
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:03,760
we're there right it's only been nine

379
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,360
years since we've had an open hardware

380
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,000
license a true open hardware license

381
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,160
that

382
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,839
where will we be in 30 more years from

383
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:12,000
now in the same time frame

384
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:13,200
will the entire stack be open i hope so

385
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,519
because and i think

386
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:17,360
key cad plays a prominent role in that

387
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:19,839
as we'll continue to try to

388
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:22,160
increase the the debt the breadth of

389
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:25,200
things you can do it with open tools

390
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:28,399
over time and uh that's one of our goals

391
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:30,320
so whenever you can use an open design

392
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:33,120
use it it sends a message to

393
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:34,560
the people who aren't open that you

394
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,760
would you prefer open because that's

395
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,638
what happened with the open source

396
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,319
software

397
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:40,320
basically the message was if we can use

398
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,440
open and it suits our needs well that's

399
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:44,160
where we're going to go

400
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,800
and so peop vendors notice that kind of

401
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,240
you know

402
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,800
when their business starts going away so

403
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:51,760
if you can use open please do

404
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:53,199
okay now i a lot of things if for those

405
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,680
of you who don't follow the project

406
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,000
closely

407
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:57,279
this is just a quick uh year in review

408
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,399
since last

409
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:03,200
um fosdem right after fosm last year we

410
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:05,120
released 5.1 this the stable release

411
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,720
i got hired to work full-time on key cad

412
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,639
yay

413
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,480
well that's a that's there's another

414
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:13,120
side of that story um

415
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,160
we had the first ever key cad conference

416
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,920
in chicago

417
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,920
in april last year and if you didn't

418
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,360
make that you missed a great con

419
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:21,360
a great conference probably one of the

420
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,480
best i've ever been to so

421
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,800
if you have a chance to make it this

422
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:26,160
year i highly recommend you you make it

423
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:29,839
and i'll talk a little bit more about

424
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:31,680
that later um

425
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:33,279
key cad services corporation was formed

426
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,959
this year one of the dings against key

427
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:36,560
cad was well i can't get paid support

428
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:38,079
for key cad well now you can there's

429
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,760
commercial so if you're if you're if

430
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:41,120
you're a corporate user and you just got

431
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,959
to pick up a phone

432
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:45,040
and call somebody you can do that now

433
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:45,920
there's and in the in the fair in

434
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,800
fairness of

435
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:49,599
open disclos or disclosure i work for

436
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,680
key cad source

437
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,199
it was it was formed by seth and i

438
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:56,079
thankfully he invited me to

439
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:57,519
be part of that and in october with the

440
00:13:56,079 --> 00:14:00,000
company that

441
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:02,399
promised me that we were going to make

442
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:06,639
t-cad flag

443
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:08,320
dropped me so so boo

444
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:09,760
so that didn't last long enough to get

445
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:12,320
anything significant done

446
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:13,680
really it was a kind of a bummer um the

447
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,519
other thing that happened in november of

448
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:17,920
last year we joined the linux foundation

449
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:18,800
and now what that means is we have a

450
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:22,319
two-prong

451
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:24,319
uh set up for um donations

452
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,920
the the cern donations will continue as

453
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:28,320
they always have but one of the reasons

454
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:29,680
we joined linux foundation is cern has

455
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,839
pretty strict rules about how we can

456
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,638
spend that money so really for software

457
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:34,399
development

458
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:36,079
the linux foundation allows us to do

459
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:38,240
things like expense

460
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:40,160
pay our developers to go give talks so

461
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,680
that's the linux foundation gives us a

462
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,480
lot more flexibility how we spend our

463
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:45,519
money it's not

464
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,959
just software development so if you are

465
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:48,160
interested in donating to links through

466
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:50,719
the linux foundation

467
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:52,719
you can just find the links there and in

468
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:56,079
the

469
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:57,519
my presentation so i joined tcad

470
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:59,040
services in december

471
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:00,560
we also moved another big thing that

472
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,800
happened we moved from

473
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:04,560
launch pad to gitlab at least just the

474
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,839
source for now eventually

475
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,040
we're going to try to migrate the whole

476
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:08,000
project there because there's a bunch of

477
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,480
stuff at github

478
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,920
right now but i'm really happy this move

479
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,600
has worked out really well i'm surprised

480
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:15,360
how easy it was and how much

481
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,600
will really i think it's going to help

482
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,399
development our workflow just a lot

483
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:22,160
better

484
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:23,519
um yesterday we had the first ever new

485
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,880
kick head

486
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:26,639
developers meeting so there was about

487
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:29,759
what 10

488
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:30,720
15 people who aren't regular key cad

489
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:32,720
developers

490
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,079
and three of us three of the lead

491
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,639
development team were there and we

492
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:37,758
worked

493
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:40,320
we introduced them to the code base and

494
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:41,040
helped them work through some pet bugs

495
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,639
that they were

496
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,000
interested in fixing so that's

497
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:44,720
significant because it's always nice to

498
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,160
be able to

499
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,000
you know bring in new talent into the

500
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,920
project and you know because the keycard

501
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,639
code base is pretty intimidating so it's

502
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,160
not

503
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:54,399
it's not something that you'd probably

504
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:59,279
want to take up on your own

505
00:15:54,399 --> 00:16:00,639
now a couple announcements keycon 2020.

506
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:01,759
if you missed last year's you definitely

507
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:04,000
want to make this year's it's going to

508
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:05,759
be at cern in geneva switzerland

509
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,000
from september 11th through september

510
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:10,160
13th the tickets haven't gone on sale

511
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,480
yet but keep an eye on either the blog

512
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:14,639
post on the keycad website

513
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:16,240
or you can go i have the link right now

514
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:18,880
it's just it's just a

515
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,839
placeholder image file there's no

516
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:22,240
information

517
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:23,920
but i suspect the tickets will probably

518
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,320
go pretty quickly to this one so if you

519
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:27,599
if you're

520
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:30,079
if you're in europe in in september and

521
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,839
going to going to cern to to talk about

522
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:32,319
all things key cad sounds interesting to

523
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:35,360
you

524
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:36,880
please please come to that conference um

525
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:39,040
the other thing is happening is monday

526
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:41,519
and tuesday and wednesday of next week

527
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,880
uh the folks at eisler and i'm going to

528
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:45,600
butcher this

529
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,600
did i say it right

530
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:50,719
okay we're going up the the

531
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,079
there's quite a few members of the lead

532
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,440
development team here we're going to go

533
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:55,279
up for a hackathon for three days and

534
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,839
work on key cad so it's we get a chance

535
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:57,199
to

536
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:59,040
it's rare when we all get a chance to

537
00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:00,880
sit down and work together it's usually

538
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,199
email and that whole process is less

539
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:04,480
than

540
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:05,839
ideal um so and just an announcement

541
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:08,079
about we've already

542
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:10,159
i put an initial goal i had no idea what

543
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:11,039
to really put down so i put 40k down for

544
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,559
one year at

545
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:14,319
linux foundation we're already about a

546
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:17,039
third of the way there since

547
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:19,678
november so the donations are good i

548
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:21,520
thank you for

549
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:23,280
all the time and so just what i always

550
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,559
it always i always say thank you to the

551
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,160
development team because

552
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:28,240
i get to stand up here and people know

553
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,960
my name by the fact that i'm the project

554
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,440
leader but

555
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,320
i'm just one guy of many it's a big team

556
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,880
of people

557
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:37,120
that writes write source code develop

558
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:39,760
libraries documentation

559
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,399
translations package builders the whole

560
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:43,760
nine yard

561
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:44,240
i mean there's probably what 50 80

562
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,879
people

563
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:48,559
combined it takes the tool you know

564
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:50,559
contributing their own little

565
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:51,600
in their own little special way to make

566
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:53,520
the project work

567
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,959
i always thank to say thanks to our

568
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:58,080
donors it's

569
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,640
it keeps key cad um going and it and it

570
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:01,520
helps

571
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,840
it attracts interest to um other people

572
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,440
who

573
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,959
might be interested in developing kicad

574
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:07,679
it definitely is a plus

575
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:09,120
we we i always say thanks for that um

576
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:11,039
thank you for your interest in key cad

577
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:13,840
um we're going to continue to do our

578
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:15,600
best to get to provide the best possible

579
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,320
electronics design application that we

580
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:19,439
can

581
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:21,280
and i i don't see us slowing down

582
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,640
anytime soon it's just going to keep

583
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:24,480
growing and growing and growing it's

584
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:26,160
getting it's getting more feature rich

585
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,960
it's getting more impressive every year

586
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:29,840
the things you

587
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:31,039
can do with keycap these days are your

588
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:33,039
there's very few limits

589
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:34,480
i mean it's not a it's not a stripped

590
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:37,679
down four-layer

591
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:40,480
board layout package it's a 27-layer

592
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:42,559
800-pin fpga monster board layout one of

593
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:44,000
one of our users who's like our

594
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:46,080
performance test guy because he's got

595
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,480
some incredibly complex designs

596
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:49,918
so kikai can handle something like that

597
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,440
you're probably not there's i don't know

598
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:53,120
too many people doing board designs that

599
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:55,919
are more complex than that

600
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:57,760
and a special thanks to seth in javier's

601
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:58,720
absence seth stepped up and did the dev

602
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,960
room so

603
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:02,720
thanks to seth for stepping up and and

604
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:11,840
helping out there so

605
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:11,840
thank you

606
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:28,320
all right remember

607
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:30,559
us sitting in this bar in april and jeff

608
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:32,080
was totally excited about all that stuff

609
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:35,200
and

610
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:38,799
now i'm well yeah there are some

611
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,799
questions in my mind whether

612
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:44,320
[Music]

613
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,840
if you mean the relationship between

614
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:47,120
between myself and jeff know it wasn't

615
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:49,439
that it was

616
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:50,320
i mean i i'm not i'm not at liberty to

617
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:54,400
talk about it

618
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:57,039
because it's not it's i signed an nda

619
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,919
so i can't talk about anything with

620
00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:00,960
company wise

621
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:04,799
but it was not my decision it was

622
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:06,159
it was based on other other factors

623
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:07,120
you could probably guess if you were

624
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:08,240
there that night you could probably

625
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:11,199
guess what happened so

626
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,200
i'm just going to leave it at that

627
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:17,919
please say something about version 6. i

628
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,679
knew somebody was going to ask him

629
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:21,440
they say something about version six

630
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:24,640
that's not really a question but we'll

631
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:26,559
i'll say something about version six um

632
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:28,080
things are starting to roll into the

633
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:30,000
master branch now

634
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:32,960
i'm working on the new file formats for

635
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,480
the symbol libraries and the schematic

636
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,559
and so that should be done here

637
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:38,480
hopefully not too distant future

638
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:39,678
because there's a lot of features new

639
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:42,960
features that kind of

640
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:44,480
sit on top of that but uh there's a lot

641
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,240
of work going on there's

642
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:47,600
some configuration work that's going to

643
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,720
change we're going to start

644
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,799
one of the things i heard somebody

645
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:52,640
earlier complain about that you know

646
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:55,120
that when you know that we we used to

647
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:58,799
say we currently save like some of the

648
00:20:55,120 --> 00:21:00,158
the uh the visibility states of the

649
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,120
layers in the board file so when you

650
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:02,080
change them even though you didn't

651
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,760
change the board the board

652
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:05,840
file changes we're ripping all that out

653
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:07,679
we're taking that out so that

654
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:09,199
that'll be a separate config file so we

655
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:10,720
got somebody working on that

656
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,960
um so there's a lot of things happening

657
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:16,960
i mean it's

658
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,960
key features curved traces

659
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:23,520
groups and rooms uh whatever

660
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:25,039
yep pad stacks we have a map we have a

661
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,480
layer manager now that you

662
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:28,400
that's already done that's been in there

663
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:29,039
for a while that you can you know set

664
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:32,000
layer color

665
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:32,320
you can set the the all the definitions

666
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,799
of

667
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:36,399
um between layers so there's a layer

668
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:37,679
stack up editor now you can you can

669
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:41,679
assign it a color or

670
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:44,880
a silkscreen color mask color uh the

671
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:45,440
thickness between each each um copper

672
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,240
layer

673
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:49,760
so yeah there's uh there's that what

674
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:52,080
else are we working on anybody what am i

675
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:56,000
missing guys

676
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:57,678
well 2581 export will be in there um

677
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,679
somebody's actually working on an altium

678
00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:00,240
importer right whether that'll be ready

679
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:01,919
for

680
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:03,919
whether that'll be ready for six or nine

681
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:07,520
i i can't say but i mean it's

682
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:11,200
sitting right there where is here

683
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:14,480
is he oh oh there he is ah yeah so

684
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:16,480
who knows you know um

685
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:18,799
i'm sorry the bus apology stuff that's

686
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:21,200
that's all right

687
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:22,559
john's bus work oh yeah that's right the

688
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:25,280
there's um

689
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:26,799
there's real time net list management so

690
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,520
the net list will be updated real time

691
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:30,879
as you make

692
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:34,320
changes so that was done yeah sorry

693
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:35,840
sorry john um but yeah it's nice because

694
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:37,678
we have the bus unfolding now that

695
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,959
if it's a feature if you you know you

696
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:41,039
create a like a

697
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:42,640
data bus or an address a complex bus

698
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:45,360
using the you know standard

699
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:46,159
text definition you you can go and break

700
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,240
out when you

701
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:50,000
right click you can break out the bus

702
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,280
each net and it'll automatically connect

703
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,120
it's pretty slick

704
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:54,960
so some new stuff going on there's some

705
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:58,158
people who want to work on um

706
00:22:54,960 --> 00:23:01,520
orthogonal uh dragging

707
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:03,039
uh with for the schematic editor so that

708
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:04,879
you know the wires stay nice square

709
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:07,039
you know right angle lines instead of

710
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:09,039
when you drag now you get

711
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:10,240
you got to break them yourself and you

712
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:12,080
know make them square again

713
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:14,240
so yeah there's a lot i mean there's

714
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:15,439
lots of things going on right now i

715
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,200
you know i know i know somebody's got to

716
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:18,480
go the next question is going to be when

717
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:21,600
and

718
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:24,960
i would say i would say

719
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:26,320
given the current rate i'm hoping we're

720
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:30,000
like in a

721
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:30,000
feature freeze in beta around

722
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:35,360
kikon we'll have a better idea at keycon

723
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:37,600
but i'm hoping we'll be close to that

724
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:40,240
so that maybe by the end of the year

725
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:43,439
we're close to a 6.0

726
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:45,120
release oh yeah yeah so

727
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,720
i just wanted to pick up on the analogy

728
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:48,879
you're making for the software side

729
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:50,159
so one of the things that helped open

730
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,760
source software

731
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:53,279
is it was an easy way for large

732
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,960
companies to come up to monetize the

733
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:55,840
cost of some of the big things they were

734
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,880
maintaining

735
00:23:55,840 --> 00:24:00,480
ibm hp and whatever else

736
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:02,159
i can see that's kind of happening on

737
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:05,600
the harbor side for a lot of things

738
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:08,159
like board design and so on where i'm

739
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:09,439
having a hard time figuring that is for

740
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:12,320
the

741
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:14,640
silicon manufacturers so the fabs

742
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:16,559
themselves i don't see how open hardware

743
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:18,960
commoditizes their costs and i was

744
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:18,960
wondering

745
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:23,120
well i there's actually um i know now

746
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:25,760
there's actually people

747
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:26,879
working on trying to get an open an open

748
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:30,000
pdk

749
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:31,760
so that's work in progress i

750
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,600
those are things that i'm not at liberty

751
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,559
to talk about but i know people are

752
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,480
trying

753
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:37,600
to to do that and i i think of like i

754
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,360
said i think event

755
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:42,879
it's it's the one it's kind of the one

756
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:45,360
domino theory if you can just get

757
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:46,000
that one even if it's not perfect and

758
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,080
even if it's

759
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,320
but it's you know it it meets the needs

760
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:53,039
of a large enough group of people

761
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:55,439
every people who want open will start to

762
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:58,080
merge that way and people will see their

763
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,640
you know other customers will or other

764
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,320
you know

765
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:02,400
fab guys will see their business going

766
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:03,918
elsewhere and it's kind of how the open

767
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,360
source worked you know it was

768
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:07,840
there was there was a first

769
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:09,360
implementation and people started to go

770
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,559
that way and no somebody noticed hey

771
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:13,360
where are all these guys going

772
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:15,039
right so i suspect that like i said i

773
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:16,320
don't i don't i'm not naive enough to

774
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:17,679
believe that it's quite the same as

775
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:20,559
software because like i said

776
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:21,120
the internet makes software cost zero

777
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:22,799
there's

778
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:24,799
never going to be a zero cost hardware

779
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:27,200
solution

780
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:28,720
is the money spent on the commercial

781
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:32,320
support anyway

782
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:32,320
less effective on code development

783
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:36,879
the question the question the question

784
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:40,639
is is um

785
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:42,799
when um so for key cad services

786
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:47,360
corporation if somebody pays

787
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:49,679
for a feature or a specific fix

788
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:51,439
does that affect it does it affect the

789
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:54,640
development it only affects

790
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:55,440
the it only affects the order in which

791
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,880
things get done

792
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,799
normally i have like a progression of

793
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,679
things i'm working on so as long as

794
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:01,520
nothing gets in

795
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:03,600
the way of that that's kind of how i go

796
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:05,039
but if somebody comes to me and pays is

797
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,240
pulling to pay me and say i want this

798
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:08,480
done first

799
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:10,799
well i'm not going to say no you know it

800
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:11,840
just i just i slip slot that in and then

801
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:14,400
everything else

802
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:15,360
but but but a lot of times it's a

803
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,960
feature that

804
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:18,879
it all gets it all gets go it all goes

805
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:20,480
back into key cad proper right so it

806
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:24,000
gets merged into the main

807
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:25,679
key cad master branch so i there there's

808
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,679
i don't see a downside to it i really i

809
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:28,159
just don't see a downside it's not like

810
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:29,840
we're

811
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:31,440
just making those features for like one

812
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:32,320
person and we're hiding it because you

813
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:35,520
can't do that

814
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:35,918
the key cad code bases excuse me gpl3 so

815
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:39,200
we're

816
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:42,960
kind of tied to that

817
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,960
what do you think is the biggest thing

818
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:46,960
what do i think the biggest thing

819
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:50,640
holding back key cad development

820
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:52,480
um oh that's a good question

821
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,840
a lot of it's just time you know people

822
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:56,960
were most of us

823
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:58,879
up until recently are very part-timers

824
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,480
you know when you have a full-time job

825
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:01,840
and family and

826
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,520
you know you want to have at least

827
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:07,039
something that resembles a life

828
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:09,520
you know which i didn't for a long time

829
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:10,799
um uh my wife was here she'd tell you

830
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:13,520
that uh

831
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:14,879
so i mean i i think that's just you know

832
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:17,679
what it boils down to is

833
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:19,279
is if we can get back into the way ways

834
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:20,159
some way to monetize it so we can pay

835
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:22,720
people to work

836
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:24,880
spent spend more time just working on

837
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:28,080
key cad instead of working

838
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:29,760
on it in their spare time so so

839
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:31,199
actually development pace has real has

840
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,679
picked up in the last couple years we

841
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,240
have

842
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:34,799
we've at most of the lead development

843
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,399
team

844
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:38,480
seems to be able to find enough time to

845
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:41,120
spend to get that get worked on

846
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:43,520
so i mean obviously it's all it'd always

847
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:45,360
be nicer if you could do it faster but

848
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:48,080
it's actually pretty it's moving along

849
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:50,559
pretty good right now

850
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:51,600
any other questions maybe uh two more

851
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:53,520
questions

852
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:55,039
yep yeah there's always a trade-off

853
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:58,240
between um

854
00:27:55,039 --> 00:28:00,720
ease of use and user experience versus

855
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:02,320
the full capabilities of what you know a

856
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:04,159
professional user using cadence or

857
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:05,600
somebody might need

858
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:06,799
what's your philosophy on that how do

859
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,480
you make that trade-off because you

860
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:11,600
don't want to make fixing

861
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:14,960
you can't make cadence the question

862
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:18,240
the question is is trade-offs between

863
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:20,240
usability and complexity um

864
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:22,159
there's always trade-offs we try to keep

865
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,679
the core features

866
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:26,880
that you would use to do simple board

867
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:28,720
layouts fairly straightforward in keycad

868
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:30,080
a lot of the times if you don't need to

869
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:32,080
use any of the advanced features

870
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:33,678
you're not necessarily exposed to them

871
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:36,720
so like say you would need to do

872
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:38,880
uh matched length tracing you tuned

873
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:40,320
to length tracing right there's there's

874
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:41,200
some configuration you have to do there

875
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,840
you can't get out

876
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:44,399
you can't get away from that because

877
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:45,678
otherwise

878
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:46,959
there are things there's parametric

879
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:47,919
things you have to set up and there's no

880
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,520
way to avoid the

881
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:51,200
complexity of doing that but if you're

882
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:53,440
just doing simple two-layer

883
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:54,559
trace boards and fill in some zones that

884
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:57,279
stuff's all

885
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:58,320
fairly straightforward i i can't imagine

886
00:28:57,279 --> 00:29:00,159
you know like

887
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:01,760
just to do simple board design layouts

888
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:03,440
the key cat is like

889
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:04,960
so complex that you can't wrap your head

890
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:08,399
around it it just

891
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:13,840
it's fairly straightforward

892
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:13,840
one more question

893
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:22,480
quite recently there was quite a lot of

894
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:25,840
like

895
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:26,320
transitions made in the coal base like

896
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:28,959
uh

897
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:29,520
for some time in the whole version i

898
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:32,480
guess

899
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:34,720
there were some changes in how the

900
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:37,919
libraries are stored

901
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:39,440
changes in well we could have chosen

902
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:43,120
different

903
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:45,200
ways the thing is rendered and depending

904
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:49,120
on that we have different features

905
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:54,480
so are all those kind of things already

906
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:57,360
some well to be super quick

907
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:58,720
the question was it's the problem with

908
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:00,399
the symbol libraries which has always

909
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:01,279
been a problem since the original design

910
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:03,600
of key cat

911
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:05,039
and the answer that is yes these were

912
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,520
the problem is is to get from where we

913
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:07,600
wanted

914
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:09,200
where we were to where we want to go

915
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:10,000
there was a couple of intermediate

916
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,480
transitions

917
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,159
and they were somewhat painful because

918
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:16,000
one of the things we always had a bug in

919
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:18,320
the old library look up

920
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,960
that was based on the library ordering

921
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:22,559
so if you had two symbols

922
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:24,240
or identical symbol names in two

923
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:26,080
different libraries

924
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:27,440
what mattered was the library ordering

925
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:29,439
so if you then

926
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:30,799
that was a if you picked the library

927
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:32,559
from one the one you thought

928
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:33,918
you got and you had the library ordering

929
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:35,678
wrong you got the other symbol

930
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:37,520
and that was the problem so that yeah

931
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:38,880
the table where you map it to a table

932
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:41,760
now they're all hard to find they're

933
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:44,880
absolute there's no relative to

934
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:46,000
the the symbols are and so there's a we

935
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:48,559
had to get from there

936
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,320
to there the next in version six the

937
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:52,080
symbols will actually be embedded in the

938
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,559
schematic like the footprints are in the

939
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,960
board

940
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:56,720
so you you won't need any cache library

941
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:58,240
anymore you'll just pick the schematic

942
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:59,840
up and take it with you and

943
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:01,760
every now you won't you may not be able

944
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:03,600
to if you don't have the symbols on your

945
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:05,440
the other machine you won't be able to

946
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:07,360
update the symbols that are in the board

947
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:08,799
with the latest versions of the symbols

948
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:10,320
in the library but

949
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:12,320
you'll still have those you'll still be

950
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:14,080
able to work on the schematic open it

951
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:15,519
it'll be completely portable that's all

952
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:17,678
part of the new file format stuff that

953
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:22,799
i'm working on

954
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:25,840
thank you

955
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:25,840
awful yeah

956
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:33,279
i gotta go
