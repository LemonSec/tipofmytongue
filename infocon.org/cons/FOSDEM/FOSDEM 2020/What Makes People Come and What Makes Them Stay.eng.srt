and this one is about community and what

4
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:18,000

7
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:32,239
hello everyone welcome to my talk what

8
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,120
makes people come and what makes them

9
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:35,680
stay

10
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,399
my name is gloria jumo i'm a computer

11
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,960
assistant

12
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:40,800
systems engineer and i'm also a mozilla

13
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,520
tech speaker

14
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,680
and i've been volunteering with a lot of

15
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:48,079
communities

16
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,840
with people all around the world and as

17
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:52,480
i've been doing that i've been seeing

18
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:55,760
different challenges

19
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:58,879
and various interesting things

20
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:00,800
which pushed me to want to improve on

21
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:03,440
various skills so that i can be able to

22
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:05,039
be more effective in communicating with

23
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:07,200
people that are different than me

24
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,640
or have a different background so in

25
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,439
doing that i've been

26
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,000
curious about what makes people come and

27
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:14,479
live because

28
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,840
sometimes especially when i started my

29
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:18,799
first

30
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,840
job while i was happy to begin my first

31
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:22,799
job

32
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:24,880
some people were happy to be living and

33
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:27,920
so people were happy to be coming

34
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:31,119
so that made me feel kind of weird like

35
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,799
okay while i'm happy to start someone is

36
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:34,640
announcing that they are leaving

37
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,000
and i've been wondering at what makes

38
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,920
people live

39
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,040
and i realized that sometimes it's out

40
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,520
of our control

41
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,159
sometimes reorganizations happen

42
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,320
sometimes

43
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:45,360
layoff happens so that one you can't

44
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:48,079
control it

45
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,560
but we can control what makes people

46
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:50,880
live

47
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:53,119
when they decide to leave so that is

48
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,320
what we are going to focus on today

49
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:57,040
and i'm also going to share a short use

50
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,919
case

51
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:01,759
on how mozilla utilized some of the

52
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:05,119
things that i'll specify

53
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:05,119
to do that effectively

54
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:10,720
so one thing to know is that the tech

55
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:13,920
industry is one of the

56
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:16,640
industries with the highest attrition so

57
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,200
a lot of people leave the tech industry

58
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,519
and

59
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,599
the tenor for a lot of tech companies is

60
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,680
about two to three years people join a

61
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:26,399
top company for two to three years

62
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,920
and usually after that they leave the

63
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:31,360
companies that people stay at

64
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:34,319
for like five years or seven years are

65
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,680
not that many and so that raises a

66
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:37,599
question like what

67
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:40,160
makes people stay longer at certain

68
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:42,720
companies and what makes them leave

69
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:45,200
and also as i show here the turnover

70
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:50,480
rate was estimated to be

71
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:54,000
23 between 2013 and 2018.

72
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:56,879
with 192 million people

73
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,360
leaving their employers so that was

74
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:00,560
something that was forecasted by a group

75
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:05,519
called haze

76
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:08,879
a group

77
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:10,480
and before we see what makes people stay

78
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:12,799
it's important to see what attracts

79
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,679
people to certain organizations certain

80
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:17,280
communities

81
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,280
and certain companies

82
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:20,879
so usually what attracts them is their

83
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,720
needs

84
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:24,399
and their wants usually they have

85
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:27,120
certain needs they need

86
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,239
a job they need money they have various

87
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,040
needs that they need to meet

88
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:32,239
and joining an organization a community

89
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:35,040
or company

90
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:37,120
is the logical thing to do but also so

91
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,200
people join because of their wants so

92
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,879
if you have privileges you don't

93
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:45,040
necessarily need to join

94
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:49,440
a company because you need to but maybe

95
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:49,440
you are at an age where you

96
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:53,680
you no more need to work but you just

97
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:56,959
want to stay active so you just

98
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:58,159
do it because you want to so when you

99
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:01,280
have certain privileges

100
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:04,798
it's easy to join organizations because

101
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,799
of your wants more than your needs

102
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:12,159
but the question is are people's needs

103
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:13,760
met and that is very related to the

104
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:15,760
demographic of people you want to

105
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:17,279
attract because different type of people

106
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,680
have different needs

107
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:21,839
so whenever you want to think of what

108
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,759
people i want to attract to my company

109
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:25,359
you have to think about their background

110
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:26,720
and what type of demographic they are

111
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,720
coming from

112
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,960
but the thing that is important here is

113
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:35,199
that specific demographics have

114
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:36,000
key similar needs so for example if you

115
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:39,360
want to hire

116
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,080
more mothers in your companies a lot of

117
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,560
them will

118
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,359
be very happy if you have parental

119
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,000
support

120
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,600
or you give pareto leave or different

121
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,320
type of benefits that cater to their

122
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,479
needs

123
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:52,000
so having that in mind is very important

124
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:55,440
because if you don't have

125
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,800
things that that cater to the needs of

126
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,560
the people

127
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,840
you'll be wondering why don't certain

128
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:03,759
people come to your company and the

129
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,758
question is you don't meet their needs

130
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,440
so here are some few examples for em a

131
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:09,359
generalized

132
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,639
group for example one thing that might

133
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,759
be they might be looking for is

134
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:14,000
acceptance

135
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:16,000
so if someone that is usually

136
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,639
marginalized comes to your company

137
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,880
organization and they feel that you are

138
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:21,759
not accepting of them or you are judging

139
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,639
them

140
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:27,039
that's one reason why they won't stay

141
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:28,320
there for very long

142
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:30,479
another thing is people with

143
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,520
disabilities they might be looking for

144
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:35,199
accessibility

145
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:37,280
that being in your organization premises

146
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:38,960
or maybe the products that you have that

147
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:41,440
you are creating

148
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:43,039
and if they are not accessible enough

149
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,039
certain people that you might

150
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:47,280
want them to use your products won't use

151
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:47,280
them

152
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,280
so it's important to keep those things

153
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:53,360
in mind

154
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,880
the needs usually are more important

155
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,720
than people's wants

156
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,719
because that is like the key reason why

157
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:01,039
people join companies

158
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:03,039
and those two things are very key to the

159
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:03,599
satisfaction that someone has when their

160
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:06,000
needs and

161
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:08,960
wants are being met you get more

162
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,520
satisfied people

163
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:13,520
so now the question is let's dive deeper

164
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,840
into this like what exactly makes people

165
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,840
live

166
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:20,240
we must first address the barriers of

167
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,960
entry because

168
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,720
before someone can leave we have to see

169
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:27,440
what are reasons that stop them before

170
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:30,720
they even enter

171
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:32,560
so the barrier to the access i have like

172
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,479
six things that i'll specify now but

173
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:37,199
they are more than this

174
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:38,318
one of them is bad fit that goes both

175
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:40,479
ways bad fit

176
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:41,919
for the organization or the company or

177
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:43,840
bad fit for the

178
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:45,359
person that is joining the company the

179
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:48,000
history of the company

180
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,639
some organizations have a bad history so

181
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,039
some people

182
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:52,160
don't really want to have anything to do

183
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:55,759
with them

184
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:58,160
and other things that are we control as

185
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:59,039
humans like poor performance or reposter

186
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,759
syndrome

187
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:02,560
could be reasons why we stop ourselves

188
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:05,360
from

189
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:07,199
entering certain organizations and then

190
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:09,199
another thing that is important is

191
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:10,319
weak networks some people don't have the

192
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:12,639
network that will

193
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:16,160
lead them or guide them to your

194
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:18,400
organization and a lot of organizations

195
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,639
pay a lot of attention to people that

196
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:22,479
are referred into the company

197
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,560
so if someone has if the demographic

198
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:28,318
you're trying to attract usually has

199
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:29,360
a weak network then it's less likely for

200
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:32,720
them to land

201
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:35,680
a job at your company if it's based on

202
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,400
if it's heavily based on referrals so

203
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,880
another

204
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:41,280
thing is red flags a lot of people check

205
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:44,479
red flags in job descriptions

206
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:45,758
and if you have certain specific words

207
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:50,159
that they're looking for

208
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:51,919
they won't consider your organization

209
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,440
another one is how much people know

210
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:56,719
about the company

211
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:59,280
some companies are for example both for

212
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,879
highly technical people and for

213
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,159
non-technical people but because they

214
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:04,479
market themselves

215
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:06,560
very heavily on the technical side some

216
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:09,360
non-technical people think that

217
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:11,599
they have no place there so they won't

218
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,319
even think to apply at those companies

219
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:14,400
so

220
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:16,319
the way you market yourself and what

221
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,840
people know about you and what you do is

222
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:19,360
very important

223
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,758
and also another thing is lack of

224
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:24,800
diversity some people don't want to join

225
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:26,720
non-diverse companies and one thing that

226
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:29,680
is interesting to notice is

227
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,319
if you check in silicon valley a lot of

228
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:33,440
the

229
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:35,599
companies the top ones at least the

230
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,120
the highest demographic is usually

231
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:40,479
related to

232
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:41,519
where the ceo is from or the race the

233
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:43,120
ceo has

234
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:44,880
so if you see a lot of top companies the

235
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:47,120
highest demographic is

236
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,320
let's say if the ceo is caucasian it

237
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,240
will be caucasian

238
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,600
and if you check deeper into that you

239
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,600
might see that the second

240
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,440
highest demographic is sometimes the

241
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,760
spouse of that ceo

242
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,920
so if the ceo is caucasian and their

243
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,839
spouse is asian

244
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:03,920
you might see those as being the highest

245
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:05,360
demographics but that doesn't mean that

246
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:07,439
changing the ceo

247
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,880
will also change like the demographics

248
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:12,080
of your company

249
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:14,720
but that just shows that how

250
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,360
the people you put to lead sometimes

251
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,279
affect

252
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,959
like the people that feel comfortable

253
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:22,080
entering your company

254
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:24,560
or not entering your company and

255
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,200
another thing that might be a barrier

256
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,599
for people

257
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,560
is the bias that exists in recruiting

258
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,040
practices

259
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:34,079
like the the applicant tracking system

260
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:36,240
and the people that build the ai behind

261
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,839
that shortlist who will get hired or who

262
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,399
will get interview or not

263
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:41,279
if they have unconscious or cautious

264
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:43,760
bias

265
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:45,519
that could be a reason why it's a buyer

266
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:48,160
for people to join the company

267
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:49,360
for example someone was saying that in

268
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,519
his company

269
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,480
a lot of women were unable to pass the

270
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:54,240
interviews

271
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:56,240
so they did like a research to figure

272
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,279
out why are a woman passing the

273
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,279
interviews

274
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:00,880
and they realized that a specific

275
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:04,000
interviewer in the company

276
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:06,480
usually plays harder questions for women

277
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,519
engineers so at the end of the day it's

278
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,040
like they couldn't pass

279
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:11,519
those interviews because they got harder

280
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:14,000
questions than their male counterparts

281
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:15,600
counterparts so that is how this one was

282
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,240
a conscious

283
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,120
bias it wasn't unconscious and that is

284
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:23,440
how some ways

285
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:26,399
people affect who gets in or who doesn't

286
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:29,120
so now we are spoke about what makes

287
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:29,120
people live

288
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:34,079
and these are some other reasons of why

289
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:37,120
people live

290
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:38,479
so break those down as well lack of

291
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:41,360
opportunities for

292
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:43,680
advancement this applies to anyone no

293
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,040
matter where you're coming from

294
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:47,120
if you don't have opportunities to

295
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,920
advance like what's the point of being

296
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,160
in the company

297
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:52,000
a lot of people want to be in an

298
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:54,640
organization where they see

299
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,360
a future where they start from a and

300
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:58,480
they can

301
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:00,720
go ahead and get to a point let's say b

302
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,160
but if there's no opportunity to do that

303
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,959
it's like

304
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:06,880
they feel that they are stagnant so that

305
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:09,040
is one reason why they live

306
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:10,320
another key one is unsatisfied with the

307
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:12,399
senior managements

308
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:15,040
the decisions that the senior management

309
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:18,000
does also they might not trust

310
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:19,599
the leaders anymore due to different

311
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,240
decisions they have made

312
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:24,800
so that is one reason why they live

313
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:28,240
another one is the work environment

314
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:30,160
and the culture some places

315
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,600
let's be honest they are very depressive

316
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:34,240
to work at

317
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,120
so if someone gets there they won't stay

318
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:38,160
for that long

319
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:39,839
and the culture the culture how much

320
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:42,079
welcoming your culture is

321
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:42,880
or not and how much you welcome cultural

322
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:45,439
ads

323
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:47,360
instead of cultural fits because

324
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,800
cultural ads means you allow people to

325
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,680
bring more of themselves into your

326
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,760
company

327
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:53,839
but cultural fit means more that people

328
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:55,519
have to fit what you want them to

329
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:58,720
portray in your company

330
00:11:55,519 --> 00:12:01,519
so that might make someone feel that

331
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:04,000
they can't stay there anymore

332
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:06,720
so another thing is people want

333
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,399
challenging work

334
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,480
they want to feel that what they are

335
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:12,639
doing is having an impact and the more

336
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:15,839
challenges that they overcome

337
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:19,120
the more likely they are to stay

338
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:22,560
and then other things like compensation

339
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:25,760
and benefits and rewards

340
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:29,680
to their contributions some people

341
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:32,800
don't feel rewarded for their hard work

342
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:36,638
even if they work hard hard enough so

343
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:38,560
that is one reason why they might live

344
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:40,720
so now seeing all that i thought it'd be

345
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:42,319
interesting to look into women in tech

346
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,480
because a lot of companies

347
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,639
and organizations want to attract more

348
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,800
of them

349
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:49,920
so one thing is being pushed to the

350
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,399
management track

351
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,920
a lot of women in tech feel that okay i

352
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:57,279
started as an engineer

353
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:59,839
but somehow the hr of people want to

354
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:01,839
put me into a managerial role and i

355
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:04,560
don't want to leave my engineering role

356
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:05,200
so that is one reason why someone might

357
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,638
live

358
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,800
if they feel that you are not supporting

359
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:10,800
them in their engineering journey

360
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,959
and you are driving them into more

361
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:16,399
non-technical roles

362
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:18,638
another one is being the only

363
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:20,240
while that might be seen as a positive

364
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:21,920
thing for some people

365
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:25,120
for some others they don't feel

366
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:27,760
comfortable in being the only one

367
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:30,160
at the company so they try to drive

368
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:32,639
efforts to bring more people

369
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:34,560
in order to not be the only one but if

370
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:37,600
that is also

371
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,599
met by

372
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:42,000
a negative stance that will make them

373
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:45,680
probably

374
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:49,360
live at a latter time so another one is

375
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:52,160
feeling the pressure to overcompensate

376
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:53,839
for your competence usually sometimes

377
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,560
when you have woman intake some people

378
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:57,360
feel that

379
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:59,599
you are not a good programmer or they

380
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:01,279
feel that you are a diversity higher

381
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,800
so it's like you always have to prove to

382
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:05,279
those people that no

383
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,160
i'm competing enough you don't really

384
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:08,320
have to prove

385
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:09,839
but there's this pressure that some

386
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,440
people feel that

387
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:13,120
i have to keep proving myself i have to

388
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,560
keep proving myself and this is some a

389
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,639
personal thing

390
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:19,839
but sometimes the environment is what

391
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:21,600
makes people feel this way as well

392
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:24,880
and there's a research that was done by

393
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:28,480
toptal where it says address 5.4

394
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:30,399
of github users when there's over 10

395
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:33,199
millions of contributors

396
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:34,639
from random samples are female so if

397
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:36,479
you're not places like open source

398
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:39,600
communities

399
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:41,440
sometimes other females need feel that

400
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,920
they need to hide and

401
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:46,639
their identity or they just don't

402
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,639
participate

403
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:51,439
so now let's look into other groups like

404
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:55,279
underrepresented and marginalized group

405
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:57,199
they have the same feeling of pressure

406
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:59,839
to prove themselves that they are not

407
00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:01,359
diversity hires their skills they have

408
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:03,920
they have the skills that are needed for

409
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:05,440
the job and they also

410
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:07,040
sometimes feel the pressure to

411
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:09,680
participate in

412
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:11,680
organizational diversity efforts like to

413
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:13,760
be in all of those diversity videos to

414
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:15,599
be in all of those photographs

415
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:17,680
to show that their their company is

416
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:20,480
diverse when sometimes

417
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:22,479
it's the opposite and that constant

418
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,079
pressure of being like the only person

419
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:26,480
in the company that is

420
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:27,120
somehow visually different because a lot

421
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,040
of

422
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:31,519
people like using visually different

423
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:33,040
people in their pr's and photographs

424
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:37,120
can bring a lot of pressure that will

425
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:37,120
make them feel that they have to live

426
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:41,600
so now let's look into open source

427
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:43,360
communities

428
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,800
in open source communities one of the

429
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:47,279
reasons why people

430
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:48,560
who live most likely is low or no

431
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:50,320
appreciation

432
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:52,399
of contributions to projects in the

433
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,199
beginning people start because they want

434
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:55,759
to contribute

435
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:58,000
to something but the more they see that

436
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:59,839
you don't appreciate what they do

437
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,199
especially when they aren't getting paid

438
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:02,720
for that as well

439
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:04,560
it makes them feel that what they are

440
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:07,040
doing is important

441
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:08,000
so then they are more likely to leave

442
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:11,199
another reason why

443
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,880
it's they get burnt out and this is more

444
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:13,519
important for volunteers because when

445
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,480
you don't get

446
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:16,959
compensated it's even more harder when

447
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,120
people

448
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:20,079
continuously ping you like can you fix

449
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,560
this bug

450
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:24,479
why haven't you fixed this yet and it's

451
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,920
like okay i'm doing this on my free time

452
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,279
why are people not being able to

453
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:29,839
understand that

454
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:31,279
i need time to rest and you constantly

455
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:34,639
push yourself

456
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:37,079
and that eventually leads to burnout and

457
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:38,639
you have to live then another one is

458
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:41,199
miscommunication

459
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:42,000
that happens usually due to the diverse

460
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:44,880
nature of

461
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,399
contributing to open source people are

462
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,279
from different countries most of the

463
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:50,160
times

464
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:52,639
different time zones and also a lot of

465
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:55,519
the communications happen virtually

466
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:56,560
so that allows a lot of miscommunication

467
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:58,320
to happen

468
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:01,758
and that might cause some people to

469
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:03,600
leave due to arguments at some point

470
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:06,319
and then another one is losing interest

471
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:09,360
in the project or conflict of interest

472
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:10,079
when you don't believe the mission of

473
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:12,079
that project

474
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:14,000
anymore or the organization that is

475
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:17,760
behind that project

476
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:19,839
so you decide to leave

477
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,799
and these issues are like a waterfall

478
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:23,438
and they cascade

479
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:24,559
they begin somewhere and if you don't

480
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:27,039
take

481
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:30,240
charge of the situation before you know

482
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:30,240
it it takes over

483
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,080
so as i said again when you don't meet

484
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:37,039
people's needs

485
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:40,399
and their wants they are less likely to

486
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:40,400
end up being satisfied

487
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:44,639
and all these things with needs and

488
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:47,840
wants somehow reminds us of

489
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:49,520
maslow's pyramid of needs

490
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:51,918
where there are certain needs that have

491
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:55,200
to be met for people to be happy

492
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:55,600
and some of those needs are fitting into

493
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,160
this

494
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,159
pyramid

495
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:03,039
and as i said it takes more than a great

496
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:06,000
job benefits it

497
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:07,039
takes more than getting a lot of money

498
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:15,520
or stocks

499
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:18,640
or having game rooms happy hours

500
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:21,918
one-third of new hearts quit their jobs

501
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:23,360
after six months and

502
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:25,200
employees knew that they would leave

503
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:27,120
after one week

504
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,280
that makes you wonder like why would

505
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,080
someone join a company and live after

506
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:33,200
six months

507
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:33,918
or how why didn't they know before they

508
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,919
joined

509
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:37,600
that they would leave and they knew it

510
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:42,000
after one week

511
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:46,320
and that is happens for various reasons

512
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:49,440
one thing is expectations vs reality

513
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:52,399
we go to a job with certain expectations

514
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:54,240
and sometimes that isn't met and then

515
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:57,360
reality strikes us

516
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:59,280
usually on the boarding session i

517
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:01,039
realized okay things look very

518
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,799
disorganized here

519
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:04,320
it looks like i don't exist i don't get

520
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:07,280
a lot of work

521
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:09,520
i'm told to study and it's two months

522
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:12,879
into my job and i'm still studying

523
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:14,960
when will i get work to do um

524
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,880
you can't communicate with your managers

525
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:18,880
that well a lot of things happen

526
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:20,880
and then when you go to hr everything

527
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:23,679
gets put under the rug

528
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:26,720
so you're wondering like is this really

529
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:30,240
what i was thinking it is it's not

530
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:32,320
so you're waiting for the right time to

531
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:35,600
leave but you can't leave that early

532
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:37,760
so usually six months feels somehow okay

533
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:39,520
for a lot of people to leave and then

534
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:41,600
they leave which is why it's very

535
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:42,240
important to put a lot of effort in your

536
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,240
boarding

537
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:46,240
session because usually in that first

538
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:48,480
week it's when people know

539
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,679
that okay i'm going to stay here for a

540
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:52,320
long time i can

541
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:54,640
sense that or i'm going to leave pretty

542
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,639
soon

543
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:00,320
it's okay we have seen what makes people

544
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:02,080
live and now we want to see what makes

545
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:03,760
them stay

546
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:06,639
we have seen a lot of like corporate

547
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:09,280
statistics from corporate

548
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:11,120
environments now we will check a bit of

549
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:13,360
the academic side

550
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:15,280
what does academia says makes people

551
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:18,000
stay

552
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:19,200
and i'll look into a research done my

553
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,320
friend of mine called

554
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:27,360
anne barcom a phd

555
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:30,799
where she analyzed what makes

556
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:32,399
volunteers be more consistent in their

557
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:35,200
contributions into

558
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,760
open source communities so one thing is

559
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:39,120
their

560
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:42,158
motives why they joined the

561
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:44,080
project that is very important because

562
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:46,080
if people join for example just to

563
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:48,320
enrich their resume they might

564
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,840
give like one or two contributions to

565
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:52,320
the project and then leave

566
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:53,678
but when they join more because they see

567
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:56,000
the bigger picture of it

568
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:57,600
and they want to see that project grow

569
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,360
or because they are using that tool and

570
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:02,158
they want to see it improve

571
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:04,719
they are more likely to stay for longer

572
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:07,440
one thing is societal norms

573
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:09,360
how society view open source in the

574
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:12,320
country the person is from

575
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:13,120
so in if so if open source is viewed

576
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:15,918
negatively

577
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:16,719
in a society people are less likely to

578
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:20,080
join and

579
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:22,400
stay into open source communities

580
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:23,439
another one is the psychological sense

581
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,120
of community

582
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:26,960
when i joined the project two people

583
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:28,719
welcome me or

584
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:31,120
it's like i don't exist and i don't get

585
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:33,200
any help and there's no documentation

586
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:34,559
and there's a lot of confusion happening

587
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:37,760
all of those things are

588
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:38,559
being taken into consideration and as i

589
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,559
said in the

590
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:41,600
previous time like when the needs are

591
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:44,559
met

592
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:46,158
and when the expectation matches reality

593
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:47,840
and they feel satisfied they are more

594
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:49,280
likely to stay

595
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:51,360
and also another thing that makes them

596
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:54,399
stay in open source projects

597
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:57,039
is the organizational commitment how

598
00:21:54,400 --> 00:22:00,720
much committed they feel to the project

599
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:00,720
the product or the organization

600
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:05,440
so one question to think about is how

601
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:07,120
effectively do we meet the common needs

602
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:09,600
of the demographic we are trying to

603
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,600
attract

604
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:13,840
and now use a specific use case of

605
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:16,480
mozilla

606
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:17,760
so mozilla has a lot of volunteers from

607
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:21,039
all around the world

608
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:24,400
and a lot of people uh usually join

609
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:26,480
with this uh flow they got

610
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,840
they got the knowledge about mozilla

611
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:31,120
through other friend

612
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:33,439
or online social media

613
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:35,840
then they got an initial opportunity to

614
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:38,720
contribute to a project or join

615
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:40,000
the organization and then they had a

616
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:42,640
great experience while doing

617
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,840
that they met a lot of people that they

618
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:46,960
liked

619
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:49,678
or they liked the culture of mozilla

620
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,799
and when proposed by others when

621
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:52,960
proposed

622
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:54,400
other sets of opportunities they decided

623
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:56,960
to stay

624
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,840
pass on the knowledge and continue to go

625
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:00,720
through this loop

626
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:01,760
over and over again anytime the

627
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:04,320
experience

628
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:05,039
that things are great anymore the

629
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:08,240
culture

630
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:10,720
changes to a negative

631
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:12,080
direction or they feel that there's lack

632
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:14,080
of opportunity

633
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:15,840
that might be a time that a volunteer

634
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:18,158
might decide to leave

635
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,879
but usually this is the flow that most

636
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:21,600
people

637
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:22,000
go through over and over again so i

638
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,879
decided

639
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,320
to give like a personal example of what

640
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:29,039
attracted me to mozilla

641
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:30,158
and what made me stay i joined mozilla

642
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:32,720
through a project

643
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:34,799
through a program called outreachy which

644
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:36,240
offers internships for people that are

645
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:39,360
underrepresented in tech

646
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:40,000
or marginalized and prior to that i knew

647
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42,399
mozilla

648
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,520
due to firefox and also because it's a

649
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:46,640
tech company

650
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:48,559
and i'm in the tech industry

651
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:50,559
so after i joined that internship and it

652
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:52,960
ended i was thinking about

653
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:55,600
how can i continue to stay in the

654
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:59,120
community is this the end of it

655
00:23:55,600 --> 00:24:01,120
and no it wasn't the end of it

656
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:03,039
i was asked to write an article about my

657
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:06,158
experience as a

658
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:08,000
web developer in turn and then while an

659
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:10,159
employee was reading it

660
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,760
they thought oh we have these certain

661
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:14,400
opportunities why don't you

662
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:15,440
join them so i was given an initial

663
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,840
opportunity

664
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:19,360
to continue being involved with mozilla

665
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:21,039
so that is what i showed here like

666
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:22,719
initial opportunity

667
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:24,240
and then after that because i had a

668
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:29,200
great experience the people

669
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:31,840
were great and also i had a great time

670
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:33,919
in relation to the culture of mozilla

671
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:34,639
when proposed with other opportunities

672
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:37,120
such as the

673
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:39,039
mozilla tech speakers program because it

674
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,678
also matched with what i was interested

675
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:43,039
in

676
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:44,640
that made me stay and continue being

677
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:48,080
involved and going through this loop

678
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:50,559
over and over again so that is one way

679
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:53,439
by which you can retain people to your

680
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:55,279
various communities you always have to

681
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,760
give them opportunities that they can

682
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:58,480
grab

683
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:59,679
on and stay if you don't give them

684
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,279
opportunity

685
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:03,520
and the moment that the opportunity

686
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:05,520
cease to exist is a moment

687
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:08,960
when you begin losing a lot of

688
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:12,000
vulnerable community members

689
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:13,600
so i'll go through quickly a few

690
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,279
suggestions and approaches that you can

691
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:17,678
follow

692
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:18,559
to make people stay more on your

693
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:21,200
organizations

694
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:22,559
and projects so one thing is honesty is

695
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,559
the best policy

696
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:26,320
people's expectations need to match

697
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:27,120
reality so you have to make sure that

698
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,480
what you are

699
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:30,479
train and what you're telling them

700
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:34,559
before they join your company

701
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:37,039
is true another thing is

702
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:38,639
research make research to set the right

703
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:40,640
expectations as i said

704
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:42,080
who do you want to attract what do they

705
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:44,799
need how can you offer

706
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:44,799
that to them

707
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:48,960
another thing is figure out ways to meet

708
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:52,639
intangible needs

709
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:55,279
as i said the perks that you give

710
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:56,799
are not the only thing the salary that

711
00:25:55,279 --> 00:26:00,240
you give is not the only thing

712
00:25:56,799 --> 00:26:02,720
people have intangible needs that

713
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:05,120
when met are more likely to keep them

714
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:08,240
there because they have sentimental

715
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:09,199
value for them so that is something that

716
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:13,200
you want to add

717
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:17,120
as well another thing is

718
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:18,000
uh have sincere create sincere efforts

719
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:21,520
to be inclusive

720
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,520
don't just make it a pr thing

721
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:26,799
and then consistently evaluate common

722
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,360
practices

723
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:30,720
and see what works what doesn't work the

724
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:33,678
things that don't work

725
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:34,480
stop them the things that work do more

726
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:38,320
of them

727
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:41,120
try to understand why they work

728
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:42,720
and lastly people are very important a

729
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:45,439
lot of people say

730
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:47,760
that they are in a company because they

731
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:48,159
have great co-workers so that just shows

732
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:50,640
how

733
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:52,000
people are very important to others so

734
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:55,440
you have to make it

735
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:58,000
uh just make a point to hire good people

736
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:59,679
and make that a priority because when

737
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,720
you do that you have good vibes in your

738
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:05,840
company and more people who want to join

739
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:06,640

so that's it i think i have a little bit

745
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:21,840
time for some questions

746
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:30,158
thank you so do we have questions in the

747
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:35,840
audience

748
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:42,880
hi gloria interesting talk thanks um i

749
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:45,600
run a small research team seven people

750
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:47,120
and sometimes people leave uh sometimes

751
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,480
that's okay because it is time for them

752
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,918
to move on sometimes i would have

753
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:53,120
preferred that they stay

754
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:55,919
um are there ways of

755
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:56,320
finding out when this is likely to

756
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:58,480
happen

757
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:59,918
i i normally find out at the annual

758
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:01,279
evaluation where we sit down for two or

759
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:02,000
three hours and we really think about

760
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:04,320
things

761
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,520
but sometimes once a year is not enough

762
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,960
and

763
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:08,559
are there key signs that you would look

764
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:11,520
for that someone is

765
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:12,080
unhappy yes so one thing you have to do

766
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,679
is

767
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:16,000
as i said communication is very

768
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:16,640
important if you have like a meeting

769
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,840
with them

770
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:22,159
once a year or i don't know you won't be

771
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:24,240
able to see the signs

772
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:26,720
because for example let's use the

773
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:29,840
natural world when someone is sick

774
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:32,320
they have some symptoms before

775
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:33,520
showing the full blown effect of the

776
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,760
illness

777
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:37,918
if you are not monitoring the person you

778
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,640
won't see understand what the symptoms

779
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:42,080
mean

780
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:44,480
and you know it when the illness has

781
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:46,000
run its course or things are really bad

782
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:48,080
so you have to monitor people from

783
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,840
before and people usually complain about

784
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:52,000
what they don't like

785
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:53,600
whether to you or to co-workers if

786
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,159
someone gives you a complaint about

787
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,559
something

788
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:58,080
over and over again or even goes to the

789
00:28:56,559 --> 00:29:00,000
extent to go to hr

790
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:02,000
you have to understand that if this

791
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,840
person could place long enough

792
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,200
eventually it will cause them a lot of

793
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:08,320
grief and they'll think

794
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:09,360
if i'm unhappy why am i here let me plan

795
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:12,480
leaving

796
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:13,840
so if you make people are happy in your

797
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:17,360
organization

798
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:18,080
and it doesn't have to be everyone

799
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:20,719
sometimes

800
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:22,399
specific things make some people unhappy

801
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:24,720
but if that thing

802
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:26,959
goes with your mission then i guess you

803
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:29,279
can't do anything about it maybe it's a

804
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:31,120
conflict of interest as i said but if

805
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:32,399
that thing is against your mission and

806
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:34,158
what you want to portray

807
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:35,918
you want to make sure that as i said you

808
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:38,159
evaluate what you're doing

809
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:40,720
and change that so you have to closely

810
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:43,679
monitor people's complaints

811
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:45,440
and if you do that you have better

812
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:47,840
understanding of when someone is about

813
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:50,799
to leave

814
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:50,799
any other question

815
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:55,840
so
