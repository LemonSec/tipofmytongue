1
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:09,440
okay

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:11,040
hello everybody welcome to foster the

3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:14,079
lightning talk session

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:16,480
i want to introduce you alexandrio with

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,520
um talk about prototyping the internet

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:21,119
of things with

7
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:24,160
willowdryne studio i hope i

8
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:26,480
sleep it's close closely okay sue will

9
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,000
give us more introduction to this topic

10
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,560
thank you for stages

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,519
thank you so hello everybody my name is

12
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,199
alex

13
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:35,839
i teach computer science at the

14
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,760
polytechnic university in bucharest

15
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,040
mostly to computer science students and

16
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,120
some computer science track to

17
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:43,200
non-computer science students

18
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:45,519
um i'm going to talk about why the dream

19
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,840
studio a project that we started about

20
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,559
five years ago with the purpose of

21
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,559
bringing

22
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:52,879
prototyping and hardware programming

23
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:55,440
closer to students

24
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:56,640
the idea was that everything is going to

25
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,718
run software

26
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,239
actually not only is trying to run not

27
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:01,680
only that it's going to run software

28
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:02,879
it's going to be connected to the

29
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,920
internet

30
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:08,158
so it will not matter in which field

31
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:10,400
you will work you will have to know some

32
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,920
basics of computer science it's becoming

33
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,520
more and more like mathematics

34
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,920
mathematics is used everywhere

35
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,840
computer science will be used everywhere

36
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:21,200
so it's automotive robotics

37
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:23,360
um manufacturing it doesn't matter

38
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,960
the problem is how do you introduce

39
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,400
computer science and how do you help

40
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,679
people that didn't study computer

41
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,360
science

42
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:33,920
to use it and that that's a challenge um

43
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:35,200
part of the solution was arduino and is

44
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,600
arduino

45
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,880
um i'm guess everybody is familiar with

46
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:42,158
this board

47
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:43,600
but they actually did is take a device

48
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:45,840
which was rather common

49
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:48,000
in computer science and engineering and

50
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,880
make it easy to use for everybody

51
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,320
it's easy to connect it has a super

52
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,079
simple programming interface and

53
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:58,320
everybody can write a program with 10

54
00:01:56,079 --> 00:02:01,520
lines of code and make something blink

55
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:03,679
so that's great the problem is it's

56
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,600
the device is limited so we're talking

57
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,280
about connectivity and arduino is not

58
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,758
exactly

59
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,038
well well you did for connectivity and

60
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:13,279
if you go to more

61
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:14,480
processing arduino again is not the best

62
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,840
solution

63
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:18,319
so um somebody in the uk came out with

64
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,239
this

65
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:22,319
which is the raspberry pi i hope

66
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:25,280
everybody is familiar with it

67
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:27,200
which is great absolutely great low cost

68
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,440
super well to use for students and for

69
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,679
prototyping

70
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:34,000
if you can connect the keyboard the

71
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,920
screen and the mouse

72
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,040
so as long as you can do this and use it

73
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:40,480
as a computer

74
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:42,720
that's super fine um

75
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,640
now the problem is what happens if the

76
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:47,599
board is inside the device

77
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,958
if you want to build a robot a car it's

78
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:51,280
on top of a building

79
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,800
so you want to use it for something more

80
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,480
electronics like

81
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,400
your raspberry pi is not going to be

82
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,079
accessible with the cr screen and the

83
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:03,200
keyboard

84
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:03,200
so this becomes increasingly difficult

85
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,400
the steps to program a raspberry pi

86
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,599
which is not

87
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,680
available with the mouse and the

88
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:11,200
keyboard is

89
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,920
you need to have some networking

90
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:17,040
knowledge find an ip address

91
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:20,159
ssh into it use some text

92
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:22,720
based editor compile it and run it

93
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:23,599
and if this sounds really easy for

94
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,799
people that

95
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:28,959
think of this or this it's really

96
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:30,319
difficult for people that did not study

97
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,560
computer science

98
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:34,560
or maybe are in fine arts in finance

99
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,239
they need to do a statue for instance

100
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,239
they want to make it interact with you

101
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:42,879
on facebook it's difficult with

102
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:44,959
ssh so taking the example of arduino

103
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:46,640
um we designed a piece of software an

104
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:47,680
open source software called while dream

105
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,518
studio

106
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,200
which is a one click software

107
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:54,720
programming for devices

108
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,119
like the raspberry pi just to go through

109
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,879
it

110
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,959
it has a simple interface so the

111
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:01,120
simplest way is just a text editor where

112
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,720
you can write some code

113
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,720
connect to your device so you hit the

114
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,840
connect button if the device is in your

115
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:08,400
local network

116
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,360
it will show up here if your device is

117
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,360
remotely

118
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,640
we have a web server which connects you

119
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,560
to the device

120
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,560
um or if you have a serial port and the

121
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,880
serial cable the device will pop up on

122
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,959
one of the serial ports

123
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:23,919
once you're connected you have a run

124
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:26,320
button this is all you need to do

125
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:27,359
so the software while loading studio

126
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:30,080
takes care of

127
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,440
copying your project to the pi compiling

128
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:34,320
it if necessary

129
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,800
running it and giving you some feedback

130
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,800
um

131
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,840
this is the basic process on programming

132
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:41,440
a pi

133
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:45,039
way easier than ssh ip addresses

134
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:45,919
logins and so on we tried to translate

135
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,840
the software in

136
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:50,159
several languages these are the

137
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:52,479
languages that we support so far

138
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,240
we would love some translators so if you

139
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:56,159
think this is a cool project it would

140
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,040
really help us if you can submit the

141
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,560
translation

142
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,880
or maybe complete some of the

143
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:03,840
translations that we have there

144
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:05,039
um if you want to do a little bit more

145
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,119
we have an advanced

146
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:08,840
interface where you can have a tree for

147
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,160
your project so you can upload some

148
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:12,000
files

149
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,840
most of the programming will be done in

150
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,400
one five programs

151
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:18,960
some people really need more so this is

152
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,638
another option

153
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,880
some people have asked us okay we don't

154
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:25,520
have a pie how do we do this

155
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:26,159
so we somehow reversed engineered

156
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,479
fritzing

157
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,600
it was not maintained until half a year

158
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:31,758
ago

159
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,360
and we are able to load some simple

160
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:35,919
fritzing designs

161
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:38,240
and simulate them actually simulate them

162
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:40,560
we don't simulate electronics we have

163
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:43,039
some of the apis in javascript so you

164
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:46,400
can write simple javascript programs

165
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:48,880
and this simulator will show them up

166
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,479
or we have been asked to do device

167
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:53,039
emulation so

168
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:54,560
if your system supports qmo you can

169
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:56,880
emulate the raspberry pi

170
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,880
one

171
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,800
these are basically some of our users

172
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:06,240
mostly universities

173
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,479
um it's also toronto public library used

174
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,960
it

175
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:10,479
a public library in bucharest used it i

176
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,919
think coder dojo used it for some

177
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:15,840
hackathons

178
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:18,799
so more or less these are our users

179
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,599
um while it in studio is at the third

180
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,720
version

181
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:25,600
this is a plugable um system so

182
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:27,280
we've built it the third time it's

183
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,520
basically a plug-in architecture

184
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:31,679
um it can be extended really really

185
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,919
easily um

186
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,759
it's fairly documented let's say so

187
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:38,318
we're looking for contributors

188
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:39,520
for the moment um we can support

189
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:42,000
raspberry like

190
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:43,359
raspberry pi like devices so anything

191
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,240
that runs linux

192
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:48,800
we can support uh an nxp chip called

193
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:51,039
rapid iot

194
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:53,120
as editors we supported monaco google

195
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:55,440
blockly for python

196
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,560
and we had an industrial project and we

197
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:59,680
needed opc ua

198
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:02,720
so we built an opc ua model editor

199
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:04,560
as languages we have python node.js

200
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,759
shell and the visual programming

201
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,800
language

202
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:11,280
but it's extensible so adding a language

203
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:13,199
is just writing another plugin

204
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,960
we have the simulators and emulators we

205
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:17,759
have a dashboard for graphing

206
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,479
it's mostly for debugging we have a

207
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,759
notebook

208
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:24,000
so if you know jupiter notebook

209
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:25,919
it's similar but for using it on the

210
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
raspberry pi

211
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:29,280
and for users that need some more

212
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,720
control we have a shell

213
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:35,758
so they can shove into their device

214
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:37,520
um the bottom line is we have a platform

215
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:40,479
that is super easy to use

216
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:42,400
at least for beginners um it's not for

217
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:42,880
writing rocket science programs but it's

218
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,919
super

219
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:48,400
good for prototyping it's fully gdpr

220
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:51,599
compliant

221
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:55,520
um and it's super easy to extend these

222
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:55,520
are the devices that we support so far

223
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:58,800
it comes in two flavors you can either

224
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,879
download an application

225
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,879
it's a web application it's an electron

226
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:06,240
package for windows linux

227
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:08,319
and mac os or we have a web application

228
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,840
it's exactly the same code base just

229
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:12,319
built for the browser

230
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:13,520
and you could use it directly online um

231
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:15,440
you can use our server

232
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,560
or you can just download the code and

233
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:19,360
run your own server

234
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:21,280
so all the data that is stored on the

235
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:23,120
online version is stored on the local

236
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,520
storage on the browser local storage so

237
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,720
it's

238
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:27,198
fully gdpr compliant basically the web

239
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,840
server

240
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:33,519
is just serving a static local

241
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:35,760
application that runs in your browser

242
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:36,880
um it's fully open source written in

243
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:39,200
javascript

244
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:41,838
actually for electron we license it

245
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:44,240
under apache to zero license

246
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:45,040
so um anybody can contribute use it

247
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:48,399
change it

248
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:50,480
so on and so forth um we're looking for

249
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:52,320
contributors so if you like the project

250
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,959
um we are really really happy to talk to

251
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:58,399
you about contributions

252
00:08:54,959 --> 00:09:00,719
translators that's another thing so

253
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:02,160
our group speaks about seven languages

254
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:05,200
together but

255
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:06,959
we surely need more and um

256
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,640
because we all have day jobs like we

257
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:10,800
work at university and students

258
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:13,360
learn at university we are looking for

259
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,359
sponsors
