1
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:11,040
okay so thank you for staying

2
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,719
all the way to the last presentation so

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,479
actually this year it's not going to be

4
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:15,040
so technical so mathematical as last

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:18,240
year

6
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,560
or the previous year it's going to be a

7
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,919
bit

8
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:23,279
of a summary of of what we're using

9
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,119
uh why we're using software different

10
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:26,880
radio in the lab and especially how it

11
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:28,480
enables experiment that you would not be

12
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,880
able to do without software-defined

13
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,800
radio so it's that's a bit the outline

14
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,719
so at the moment if you look a bit in

15
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,519
the literature i was just looking at the

16
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:38,000
latest

17
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,879
uh articles in the review of scientific

18
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,320
instruments

19
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:41,599
it seems like every scientist or

20
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,079
everyone who's doing software different

21
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,399
radio

22
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:46,559
has to publish uh either a network

23
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:48,160
analyzer or a lock-in amplifier or

24
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:49,760
whatever whatever you want is

25
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,120
basically at the moment you see that

26
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,079
more and more software and radio are

27
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,599
getting into some

28
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,120
some of these experiments actually some

29
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:58,480
quite fancy experiments

30
00:00:55,120 --> 00:01:00,399
um so what actually what kind of

31
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,519
uh scientific instruments would i

32
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:02,879
address with software

33
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,640
and radio is of course this is not

34
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:06,240
exhaustive it's just the kind of topic

35
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,320
that we address in our lab

36
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,679
uh everything that's related to radio

37
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,158
frequency signals so that's

38
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,119
uh spectralizers vector network

39
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:14,720
analyzers

40
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:16,000
basically here you've got very basic

41
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,920
instruments but what i'm going to tell

42
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,880
you later is whenever you use one of his

43
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,479
lab equipments

44
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,000
some of your colleagues if you leave

45
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:22,640
your instrument for too long on an

46
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,320
experiment

47
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,000
someone will say this is not used i can

48
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,600
take it and you know that at some

49
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,960
point your experiment is going to be

50
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,759
dismantled because someone needs the

51
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,119
instrument so

52
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,560
with software infrared radio you're the

53
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:35,920
only one to know how to use your stuff

54
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,920
so no one's going to steal it from you

55
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,079
but more seriously than locking

56
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,920
detectors that's improvement of

57
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:43,759
of uh of of bandwidth i don't know if

58
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,040
you if you read uh scientific journal

59
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:46,479
like physics today but

60
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,320
every time things today you've got the

61
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:49,600
first advertisement so stanford

62
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,439
instruments showing we have analog

63
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,880
blocking amplifier and just on the page

64
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:55,039
afterwards you've got zurich instruments

65
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,719
saying we've got this full uh digital

66
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,640
locking amplifier and everyone is of

67
00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:00,079
course saying mine is better stanford

68
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,600
says we have lower noise level

69
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:03,279
the uh zurich says we have higher

70
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,839
bandwidth and so depending on what you

71
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,360
need so

72
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,000
beautiful thing with software even radio

73
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,758
you tune your hardware to your needs and

74
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,038
then i'm going to show you a bit about

75
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:12,480
basic physics and scanning for

76
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:12,958
microscopy i couldn't find the reference

77
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,879
there is

78
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:17,760
i know there is a published magnetic

79
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:19,599
force microscope that's been done with a

80
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,879
usrp but i couldn't find reference when

81
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:22,799
preparing this

82
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:24,480
so actually as i was starting this uh

83
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,160
presentation my original presentation

84
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,879
you remember maybe a couple of years ago

85
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,599
i presented

86
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:30,239
a passive radar so when i was visiting

87
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:32,319
japan

88
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:33,599
professor sato's laboratory in sendai i

89
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:35,839
discovered how you can use

90
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:36,799
uh oscilloscope for doing a radar

91
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,760
measurement because you've got a

92
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,319
broadband

93
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:41,359
uh radio frequency receiver so now most

94
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:43,518
uh radio

95
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,920
oscilloscope will have two five yards

96
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:47,920
bandwidth so this this uh rodent schwarz

97
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,040
uh must be five gigahertz bandwidth two

98
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,920
point five just a

99
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,799
2.5 sorry five gigahertz bandwidth uh

100
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,599
measurements

101
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,120
and uh initially i was playing with my

102
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:59,280
colleagues trying to do some

103
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,440
some some software for acquisition but

104
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,760
uh it took me a bit of time to make some

105
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:05,040
usable uh new radio interface for

106
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:07,280
oscilloscope so now

107
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,959
uh what we're looking at is collecting

108
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,560
data from the oscilloscope so

109
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:13,280
you know that the schedule of new radio

110
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,120
is working with kilobyte packets

111
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,319
all of these oscilloscopes have mega

112
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,840
sample memory depth

113
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:20,079
so what we're doing is we're collecting

114
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,760
a big chunk of data and of course for an

115
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,360
experiment you don't claim to be

116
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,359
continuously streaming data

117
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,959
you just need chunks of data but if you

118
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,480
have high bandwidth measurements

119
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,879
you still can do quite a serious things

120
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,679
and the obvious presentation beyond

121
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:33,280
radar

122
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,799
is a time-of-flight measurement so

123
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,560
time-of-flight measurements is

124
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:38,000
measuring length of coaxial cable so

125
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,440
here we have our

126
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,720
software defined radio source of course

127
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,840
you cannot treat it but we've got the

128
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:45,280
four channels from the

129
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:47,840
oscilloscope and these four channels are

130
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,799
fed by a noise generator this noise

131
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,239
generator

132
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:52,319
is the reference signal and if you

133
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:55,519
correlate uh this noise

134
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:56,480
source with uh the uh received copies on

135
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:58,080
the other channels

136
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:01,280
you've got the time delay so you see

137
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,239
here 177 nanoseconds 187 nanoseconds 202

138
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,080
nanoseconds

139
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:06,000
and that's actually the time of flight

140
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:09,360
in my two meter or three meter

141
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:12,640
coaxial uh cable so uh very easy

142
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:14,159
uh range resolution is velocity of light

143
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,560
and coaxial cable 200 meter per

144
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:18,079
microsecond divided by twice a bandwidth

145
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,839
if we have something like a gigahertz

146
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,199
bandwidth we have 15 centimeter

147
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,839
resolution if we have five gears

148
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:24,560
bandwidth

149
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:26,080
we get three centimeter resolution so uh

150
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,840
that's one of the classical ways of

151
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:30,320
measuring

152
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:33,198
um a defective

153
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:34,159
optical fiber or crucial cable so

154
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:35,680
another obvious

155
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,440
application which does not need

156
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,120
continuous streaming is

157
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,560
uh displaying the spectrum so when

158
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,600
you're just displaying the spectrum you

159
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,680
want to know

160
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,720
who is sending information on on the

161
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,600
channel you don't need for it

162
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,800
necessarily

163
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:51,280
to uh to to to decode this information

164
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,280
and here the upper limit is given by the

165
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,239
bandwidth of of your oscilloscope the

166
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,159
lower limit

167
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,759
is given by the sampling size so for

168
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,560
example if you have a 2.5 kilo sample

169
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:00,960
per second

170
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,240
oscilloscope and you have an eight

171
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,880
thousand eight thousand

172
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,000
uh fourier transform then you start at

173
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:09,199
uh

174
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,639
6 600 kilohertz so that that's the kind

175
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:13,280
of application that's easily

176
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:13,759
applicable and of course the drawback of

177
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,520
this

178
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:16,880
radio frequency oscilloscope is very

179
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,599
very low number of bits

180
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,880
they claim 12-bit resolution uh if you

181
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:24,160
can get 10-bit nob

182
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:26,240
you're already good and so this limits

183
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,600
the ratio of a stronger signal to the

184
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,039
weakest signal that you can detect so

185
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,560
that's one of the big drawbacks

186
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:33,599
of your software-defined radio with

187
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:36,000
respect to analog front-end

188
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:38,000
so uh actually so this we start this

189
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,960
work was started a couple of years ago

190
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,560
and uh in the meantime as i was getting

191
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:45,198
ready to

192
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,880
publish some of the presentations marcus

193
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:49,440
released new radio 3.8

194
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:52,240
so everything that i did on 3.7 had to

195
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,240
be started again

196
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,320
and so it took another six months

197
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,319
so basically what what is this gr

198
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,560
oscilloscope

199
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:04,080
out of three modules that we released uh

200
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,240
is

201
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,599
a demonstration an example of how to

202
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,400
interface new radio

203
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,960
with other communication in this example

204
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,560
uh

205
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:14,159
over communication protocol in this

206
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:17,360
example i'm using vxi

207
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:19,840
which is a gpib over ethernet and uh

208
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,039
the user configurable oscilloscope

209
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,799
allows you to tune

210
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:24,880
ip address sample rate measurement

211
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:27,199
duration variable number of sources so

212
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:29,039
basically i take this as a tutorial so

213
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:30,400
first of all a tutorial on how to write

214
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:33,440
an ot block

215
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,880
and uh now it has become uh

216
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,319
so actually it's just been released in

217
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,280
the for the french reading audience

218
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:39,440
which has been released

219
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,799
in the latest linux magazine uh i take

220
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,960
it also as a

221
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,479
tutorial on how to translate a new radio

222
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:47,680
3.7

223
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:49,919
out of three module to a new radio 3.8

224
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,520
as i was about to upload the english

225
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:53,758
translation of the article i realized

226
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,359
that i had not upload updated to a 3.8

227
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:56,800
so if anyone is interested i'll be happy

228
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:59,360
to translate it at the moment

229
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,840
on the website on the fosdem site you

230
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,080
only have a french version of a

231
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:04,239
manuscript

232
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,440
so why would you even bother looking at

233
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,360
an oscilloscope as

234
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:09,039
a radio frequency source so this is

235
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,160
actually the experiment that happened to

236
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:11,680
us as we're playing with the

237
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:14,479
oscilloscope in japan

238
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,599
is uh we had sent at the time we're not

239
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:17,199
using a random

240
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:18,719
generator we're just using a sine wave

241
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:19,680
and the sine wave was collected by two

242
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,120
channels

243
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,800
and you think that when you buy one of

244
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,560
these high-grade oscilloscopes if they

245
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,240
claim that the two channels synchronous

246
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,759
well they must be synchronous and this

247
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,360
is absolutely not the case

248
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:31,440
if you look at the phase between these

249
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:33,599
two channels of course

250
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:35,199
this is an 800 megahertz signal fed to a

251
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:37,440
10 gigahertz oscilloscope so

252
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:39,360
we have about a ratio of 1 to 10 between

253
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,639
sampling frequency and carrier frequency

254
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,160
well sometimes you see some of these

255
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:43,199
gems so even someone as clever as

256
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,120
agilent

257
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:47,520
has some missing packets or some missing

258
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,280
data between removable channels so

259
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,120
actually the funny thing is we realized

260
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,719
we did not have this kind of jumps

261
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,280
between channel one and four but with

262
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,199
reaching

263
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:57,840
channel one and two we are losing some

264
00:07:55,199 --> 00:08:00,479
some samples don't ask me why that's way

265
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,479
out of state

266
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:06,240
why is it gigahertz sorry

267
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:08,319
i must have misspelled this is a 10

268
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,400
gigahertz oscilloscope with an 800

269
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:13,120
megahertz oscilloscope

270
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,679
sound wave output uh these are

271
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,199
experimental

272
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,560
actually this is not this is one that i

273
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:18,080
captured but this i mean this is the

274
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,759
kind of thing that you see jumping

275
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,120
uh if you trigger on on the phase you

276
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:22,639
see this jumping every like one every

277
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,960
once every second it's not periodic but

278
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:24,639
so

279
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,000
you see if you're doing radar and you're

280
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:26,639
doing coherence measurements where you

281
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,400
want to do

282
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:29,759
direction of arrival if every second

283
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,039
your phase is jumping of course

284
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,800
you're going to have trouble uh

285
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:34,958
collecting this kind of information so

286
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:37,359
again this is the kind of data that we

287
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:38,958
collected oscilloscope source

288
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,839
either you do the hilbert transform to

289
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:41,838
gave a complex

290
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,200
output which gives you a phase in

291
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:46,640
magnitude or you take the fourier

292
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,200
transform and multiply conjugate to

293
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,959
correlate

294
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,959
and in both cases of course you have

295
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:52,000
consistent phase jumps because it's

296
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:54,000
really physically

297
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,839
your oscilloscope that is missing some

298
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,680
some samples

299
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:59,200
so that was the first step and then i

300
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,719
thought okay let's try to show a little

301
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,600
bit what we're doing with other front

302
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,480
ends

303
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:06,560
so doesn't this look to you like a

304
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:09,760
coherent four channel locking detector

305
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,800
uh i mean i take two b210s i take the

306
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,200
one pps

307
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,959
uh to try to lock their inputs and as

308
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,399
long as i keep on continuously streaming

309
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:17,199
the data to not to lose a phase

310
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:21,120
condition

311
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:23,120
then i have here a fortune unlocking a

312
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,360
locking detector but with the other

313
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:27,680
advantage that i don't have to go for

314
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:29,680
vxi or gpib to collect data

315
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,880
i have streaming data so what i'm going

316
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,239
to show you later is that

317
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,760
the bandwidth for communication

318
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,279
bandwidth of course i have i in a

319
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,040
locking i'm doing a very narrow

320
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:38,560
measurement but because the data are

321
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,519
streamed quite quickly so i can do some

322
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,359
some nice measurement

323
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:43,040
of course i've got the flexibility which

324
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,760
i'm not going to convince this audience

325
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,800
but i can tune the the functionalities

326
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:50,000
of my instrument

327
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:52,800
depending on my needs and here

328
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,920
in the example of a pluto sdr here uh

329
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,000
this is something that we're using in

330
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:58,719
the lab but in our lab we're doing some

331
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,839
uh some some time transfer or sorry some

332
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,000
frequency transfer

333
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:03,680
between high stability oscillators so if

334
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,279
you try to create

335
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:09,199
a feedback loops of using a crappy

336
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:10,880
temperature control crystal oscillators

337
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,320
and you're trying to lock two

338
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:14,240
atomic clocks that's not going to work

339
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,880
very well so in this example for example

340
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,279
we can

341
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,800
clock the pluto sdr from hydrogen maser

342
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:21,439
unfortunately hydrogen major

343
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:23,279
generate 10 100 megahertz signal and

344
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:25,839
somehow when you plot the phase noise of

345
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:28,240
your pluto hdr or your ad9363

346
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:30,079
you realize that you need to to feed it

347
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,920
something above 40 megahertz so maximum

348
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:33,359
seems to be 60 megahertz not exactly

349
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:36,479
shorter specs but

350
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:38,079
80 megahertz top but below it starts

351
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,079
working at 10 megahertz but between 10

352
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:42,079
and 40 megahertz you have a very poor or

353
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:43,439
degraded phase noise so you cannot just

354
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:44,479
take the hydrogen major you need to

355
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,560
trick a little bit of

356
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,680
the synthesis but uh you feed it with

357
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:50,160
your 40 megahertz

358
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:52,160
uh input and then you can do some sort

359
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:54,240
of feedback loop on your on your

360
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,519
uh control so this is the kind of thing

361
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,399
that software defined radio allows you

362
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:58,320
to do so if

363
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,760
i take just an oscilloscope or actually

364
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,440
any rodent farce

365
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,880
instrument uh well actually rhode island

366
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,240
tristan is a good example because i can

367
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,680
i can feed it with a 10 megahertz

368
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,200
external clock but oscilloscope i've

369
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,680
never seen an oscilloscope which i could

370
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,399
give

371
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:12,239
external clock to uh to to clock my a2d

372
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:14,480
converters

373
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,000
so here is an example of a practical

374
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,040
demonstration i'm not doing i'm not the

375
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,240
guy doing the

376
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:22,399
frequency transfer um you're all using

377
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,360
quartz quartz is a little piece of

378
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:26,560
material

379
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:28,720
that creates the rate at which your

380
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,839
microprocessor is clocked and if you

381
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,320
take a quartz

382
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:33,120
actually it's kind of funny that uh 300

383
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:36,959
years ago

384
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:39,760
your clock was uh uh

385
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:40,880
the the time of a second was was defined

386
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,200
by the motion of

387
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:45,519
of of this uh of your clock and actually

388
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,440
today your frequency is still given

389
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:48,720
by the thickness of a piece of course

390
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,600
between which you put your two

391
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,079
electrodes and

392
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,360
everyone will go to farnell by a quartz

393
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:55,439
and say if i just

394
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,200
put the right capacitor it will

395
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:59,200
oscillate at eight megahertz

396
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:01,040
i just want to show you here that it

397
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:03,440
oscillates at eight or 16 megahertz

398
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:06,240
because there's been a huge body of work

399
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:07,600
in tuning the shape of these uh surfaces

400
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,079
of tuning the electrodes

401
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,200
this is just a device that a colleague

402
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:12,959
of mine gave me

403
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,120
to characterize the acoustic mode this

404
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:18,239
is the kind of thing i i do from

405
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:20,079
as research you can map

406
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,200
the acoustic field so remember it's an

407
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:22,560
electrical component from your

408
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,000
perspective it's just an electrical

409
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,599
dipole but the physics

410
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,079
is that actually it's a piece of quartz

411
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:30,240
vibrating and i'm going to show you

412
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:33,359
later how you how you measure this but

413
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:36,079
this is the electrode and if i look at

414
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:38,000
the field of displacement i can detect

415
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:39,599
the magnitude of the displacement and

416
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,200
the phase of the displacement and

417
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,720
if you're not careful in the way you

418
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,600
pattern the electrodes on your piece of

419
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,360
cords

420
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,720
on top here you've got the spectrum so

421
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,880
that's the a

422
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,880
real part of the admittance and all

423
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:52,079
these peaks are the various modes so if

424
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:54,079
you were just to put this on the

425
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:57,040
microprocessor or microsoft

426
00:12:54,079 --> 00:13:00,160
um feedback loop well you would just

427
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:02,399
wouldn't know if it starts on 445 on 47

428
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,439
65 megahertz it will just start on one

429
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:04,959
of these modes

430
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:07,279
and actually i like this picture because

431
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:08,880
it shows you that on on low frequency

432
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:09,519
mode it's not really very exciting

433
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,360
you've got

434
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:12,560
this shape you've got this shape but

435
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,560
when you start looking at

436
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:16,479
high frequency modes sorry this is a

437
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:18,239
frequency so this is five megahertz

438
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,360
uh where you go to eight megahertz you

439
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,399
start seeing this is a different

440
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,240
propagation mode

441
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:24,000
but then when you go to 12 megahertz you

442
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:26,000
start seeing some beautiful patterns

443
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,760
so this is over all the standing waves

444
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,480
that you can find on a piece of course

445
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,079
and then of course

446
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:33,760
the higher the frequency the higher the

447
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:35,680
mode and the the nicer of the patterns

448
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:37,439
so how do you collect this kind of of of

449
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:40,000
data uh

450
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:41,279
that's uh your sky so basics of scanning

451
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,800
pro microscopy

452
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:44,320
um actually we've got an expert i'm

453
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:46,079
scanning for microscopy here in front so

454
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,720
scanning pro microscopy is the idea that

455
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:49,680
you'd have

456
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,399
a scalar probe and for each position of

457
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,079
your sample

458
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:54,240
you collect a measurement and then you

459
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:56,319
move a little bit your sample collects a

460
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,279
new information right so you only have a

461
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,440
single probe

462
00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:00,800
and it's because you move a sample under

463
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:03,120
your probe that you can map

464
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:04,560
the physical quantity in this particular

465
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,519
case the physical quantity that we're

466
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:08,000
interested in

467
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:08,560
is the out of play motion of a piece of

468
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,079
quartz

469
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,518
and how do you measure an out-of-plane

470
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:12,800
motion you make an interferometer so an

471
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:15,120
interferometer is

472
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,800
you send the laser you split the laser

473
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:19,519
you illuminate your sample

474
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:21,439
you compare the time the the distance

475
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:22,880
between the reference arm so actually in

476
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,639
part in this particular case

477
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:26,720
the reference arm is given by the

478
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:28,320
reflection of a laser in front of this

479
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,000
helium neon it's not the right way of

480
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,880
doing it but that's how we do it and

481
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,120
then you look at

482
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:35,199
the reflected signal and this reflected

483
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,399
signal will be at a phase which is

484
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:38,319
dependent on the

485
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:39,760
path difference between this part and

486
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:42,000
this part

487
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:43,360
if you just anyone anyone who's done

488
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,440
basic physics courses and who's

489
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:47,360
assembled the mechanical interferometers

490
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:49,199
know that this fringe pattern is

491
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,920
extremely sensitive to environment if

492
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:51,920
you just

493
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,959
uh heat a bit of the air if you just

494
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:55,120
blow a little bit some

495
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:56,560
some hot air in front of a reference arm

496
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:59,120
you're gonna see the fringe

497
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:00,560
moving so if we were to do this kind of

498
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,639
measurement with a basic

499
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:05,119
nickel center for emitter we would have

500
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:07,040
a static phase varying so what we do is

501
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:09,120
we frequency shift from baseband to

502
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:11,599
radio frequency band using an archoptic

503
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:13,600
modulator and this acoustoptic modulator

504
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,880
is clocked at 80 megahertz this is a

505
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,040
narrowband device

506
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:18,800
so we send the laser the laser is

507
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:20,800
modulated at 80 megahertz

508
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:22,000
it goes to the sample comes goes back to

509
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:24,639
the acoustical optic

510
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,160
modulator so 2 times 8 megahertz 160

511
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:27,839
megahertz and this is what is going to

512
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,639
the radio frequency detector which is a

513
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:31,120
high frequency

514
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:32,480
photodiode so this is the basics of

515
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,680
heterodyne approach

516
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,600
if you don't understand the basic

517
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,479
physics of what i just mentioned just

518
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,680
remember that

519
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:42,639
what you get here is 160 megahertz

520
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:43,199
twice the acrostic modulator frequency

521
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:45,440
plus

522
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:47,439
your acoustic device here and typically

523
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,399
this will be a quartz at 16 megahertz

524
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,800
for example so

525
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:51,759
you intrinsically have a radio frequency

526
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,479
measurement here

527
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:56,160
and what you want is to collect these

528
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,360
two channels the reference channel the

529
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:00,800
measurement channel

530
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:02,320
using uh one of these uh uh one of these

531
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:04,880
uh

532
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,759
signal processing system so we heard

533
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,720
multiple times

534
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:09,279
zero mq i just want to emphasize we use

535
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,000
zero

536
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:13,199
i fell in love with zeromq when i was in

537
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,079
japan because

538
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:18,160
i i could separate what new radio was

539
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:19,519
for which is collecting streaming radio

540
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:21,680
frequency data

541
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:23,600
and what someone else was doing in this

542
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:26,638
case it will be a new octave

543
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:28,160
which is asynchronous operations in this

544
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:29,360
case for example i want to steer an

545
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:31,360
antenna or i want to move

546
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:33,199
this position under the sample that's

547
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:35,040
not the job of new radio here radio is

548
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:36,800
streaming radio frequency data it has

549
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,399
other things to do than to program a

550
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,199
positioner to tell it move to a new

551
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:41,440
position so

552
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:42,240
what we're doing here is we have a b210

553
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,399
this b210

554
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,440
is collecting on two channels radio

555
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:47,120
frequency signals

556
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,480
we want to know the ratio of the

557
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,759
reference channel of the measurement

558
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,199
channels of a reference channel so we

559
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:53,199
divide these devices

560
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:54,719
low pass filter because we have far too

561
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:56,560
many samples per second

562
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,920
and we stream this data to our first

563
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,518
zero and q sync

564
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:01,040
and then i would like to make sure that

565
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:02,800
my experiment is working properly so i

566
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,920
want to get the magnitude of each one of

567
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,760
these channels just to make sure that my

568
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:07,760
signal to another ratio is sufficient

569
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:10,079
so i take these two magnitudes low pass

570
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:11,359
again flow to complex and these two

571
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,879
complex of course it's not real and

572
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:16,159
imaginary but it's two magnitudes

573
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:19,360
i stream to a second zero and q string

574
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:21,120
and these two 0mq streams are sent to

575
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:23,359
new octave and neoctave

576
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:24,799
will make the best on the one hand of

577
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:25,839
zero mq on the other hand of the

578
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:28,160
instrument control

579
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:30,639
uh new octave provides functionalities

580
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:32,559
for communicating rs232gpib

581
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:34,080
all these common communication modes so

582
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:37,360
in this particular case

583
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:39,039
my zero my uh instrument control will

584
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,959
talk through a serial port

585
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:42,960
to this positioner so this uh

586
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:45,520
positioning system that moves my

587
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,000
sample under the probe the laser probe

588
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,160
so i can

589
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,840
just send messages and that's again i

590
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:52,559
think not the job of new radio

591
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:54,080
to stop its streaming activity to send

592
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:55,440
commands to a positioner that is moved

593
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:57,918
once every second

594
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,880
and then as my new octave has moved the

595
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:01,760
positioner

596
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:03,200
i open the socket a zero and q sockets

597
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,879
actually since i have two streams i have

598
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,799
to open two zero mq sockets

599
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,480
in a published subscribe that's

600
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:11,600
analogous to a

601
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:13,760
udp so either data are are

602
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:16,639
sunk and good i process them or they

603
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:19,600
just lost but there is no

604
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:20,320
tcp transaction so i subscribe to my

605
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,959
socket

606
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:24,399
i collect data because 0mq is sending

607
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,080
kilobyte

608
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:28,240
size if you want more than a few

609
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,960
kilobytes you need to collect multiple

610
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,120
sockets

611
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:33,039
multiple packets and the only way i

612
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:35,760
found to make sure that i'm synchronous

613
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:36,799
between my positional motion and my zero

614
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:39,120
mq stream

615
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:41,440
is to close the socket and open it again

616
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:43,840
when i'm at the new position

617
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,720
so in this example for each position x

618
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,639
and y i collect

619
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:48,000
20 radio frequency samples and what's

620
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:50,880
really important to me is

621
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,799
i never stop the radio frequency stream

622
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:55,520
because the b210 if i have 2b

623
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:56,960
to 10 they start being synchronous but

624
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,639
you don't know what is the phase of set

625
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,679
so if at some point i stop the stream

626
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,600
and i start it again

627
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:03,760
i start with a new phase offset and i

628
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,480
cannot compensate for it so in here in

629
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,879
this case

630
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,520
i keep on streaming radio frequency data

631
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,120
and it's

632
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,960
and at least if i calibrate my phase

633
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:13,840
offset i know it's the same throughout

634
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:15,360
the data i collect so this is a kind of

635
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:17,439
experimental setup we have

636
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,799
if you take your basic experiments

637
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:21,280
you're going to see what it looked like

638
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:25,120
initially

639
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:27,678
you had this positioner so this is uh

640
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:28,559
well when i what i call positioner is

641
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:30,960
this little

642
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:31,678
uh sliding stage is you've got one in x1

643
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,919
and y

644
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:35,280
and you want to position the sample with

645
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:37,600
a sub micrometer

646
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:38,320
uh accuracy so it actually takes a bit

647
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,799
of time

648
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:42,240
for this servo to settle actually what

649
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:44,559
you realize it takes about 10

650
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:46,640
milliseconds for the servo to settle

651
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:47,760
so when you have this positioning system

652
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:50,400
you've got this

653
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:52,480
laser beam laser beam is illuminating uh

654
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:54,720
the sample for this optical microscope

655
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,919
lens here and if you take general

656
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:59,360
purpose instruments

657
00:19:55,919 --> 00:20:00,799
remember what i needed is two magnitudes

658
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,840
to make sure that my signal-to-noise

659
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:04,400
ratio is good

660
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:05,439
and one phase information from a lock-in

661
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:08,080
amplifier

662
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:09,600
if you do this with a general purpose

663
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:13,199
lab grade instrument

664
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:15,280
you need four uh gpib communication that

665
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:18,080
takes about one second per sample

666
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:19,360
to stream data and if you have about 100

667
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:21,840
by 100 samples

668
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:23,360
that's 10 000 seconds so you just uh

669
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:25,840
wait for about three hours

670
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:28,158
because your gpib communication is so

671
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:29,600
slow even over vxi11 even even if you do

672
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:31,440
ethernet it's the intrinsic

673
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,879
uh here you have to trigger the

674
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,480
measurement collect the measurement

675
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:37,039
fetch the measurements and start again

676
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:40,720
so you see here we start with 10

677
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:43,840
000 seconds for one measurement if you

678
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:45,360
go to streaming from a new radio from

679
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,959
software radio

680
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,879
you remove the bottleneck you're only at

681
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,679
10 milliseconds per sample so you see

682
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:53,200
that you go

683
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:55,520
from 10 000 seconds to about 15 minutes

684
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,640
so here is where software different

685
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,918
radio enables

686
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,559
something that would not be done

687
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:01,919
previously it's high throughput data

688
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:04,320
but then you see that these 10

689
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:05,840
milliseconds they're not really related

690
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,439
to streaming the data it's just because

691
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,799
i'm wasting time waiting for this

692
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,200
projector to sell

693
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:12,400
so what about removing the positioner

694
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,159
and moving the

695
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:15,919
optical beam so what we did is we

696
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:17,039
removed the positioner that takes 10

697
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:20,000
milliseconds to settle

698
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:21,760
and we just put two rotating mirrors and

699
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,720
these rotating mirrors they have very

700
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:25,200
small inertia

701
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:26,799
so they will move at 100 hertz instead

702
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:29,360
of 10 milliseconds

703
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:30,080
for settling its position i can get a

704
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:32,080
whole line

705
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,678
in 10 milliseconds and there you see

706
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:35,678
that you take the best out of the

707
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:37,200
streaming of software fan radio because

708
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:38,880
now you're not wasting you're just

709
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,320
limited by the data stream for the

710
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,480
software different radio

711
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:44,720
notice that we started with 10 000

712
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:46,880
seconds per measurement and we reach

713
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:48,400
two seconds per measurement this is what

714
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,600
i call what you could not do without

715
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,200
software found radio

716
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,879
with ten thousand second measurements my

717
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,080
colleague were starting an experiment

718
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:56,080
leaving the lab in the evening and they

719
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:58,080
would collect the data the next day

720
00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:00,320
now i can tune my experiments i can

721
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:01,840
focus i can change the focal length here

722
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:04,320
just by looking at the outputs of the

723
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:05,439
images because it's reflec refreshed

724
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:07,678
every two seconds

725
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08,799
so here is what i'm calling enabling

726
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:10,400
experiment that would not be done

727
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:11,840
otherwise and again you see here

728
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,919
this is one of the vibration mode of

729
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:16,480
your course where you've got uh

730
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:18,880
one node and and two maximum amplitude

731
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:20,320
displacement which are out of phase

732
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,640
so it's actually a motion that looks

733
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:24,240
like this on my piece of quartz

734
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,760
uh and this is actually what you gain

735
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:27,679
from software different radio initial

736
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:29,039
experiment was actually the the locking

737
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,600
amplifier has already been stolen by

738
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:31,280
someone

739
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:33,520
you had two spectrum analyzer you have a

740
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:34,399
network analyzer and all this stuff is

741
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:36,720
replaced by

742
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:38,000
an e310 here because i wanted to be

743
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:40,559
completely autonomous

744
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,679
and a couple of passive uh radio

745
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:43,760
frequencies so

746
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:44,880
uh gwen presented to you the austrian

747
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,960
digital framework

748
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:48,159
all this stuff here has been uh uploaded

749
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:51,520
on the oscar digital

750
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:53,679
and where we upload our custom firmware

751
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:55,679
is in triggering the measurement from

752
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:56,799
the e310 so the stream is triggered by

753
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:58,880
an external signal

754
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:59,918
and this is the novelty where we change

755
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,760
the

756
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:04,960
original firmware to have external

757
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:07,120
trigger of the data stream

758
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:08,720
to conclude this presentation another

759
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,840
thing that we're doing is pulse radar

760
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,559
pulse radar

761
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:13,520
is i'll go very quickly quickly through

762
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:15,600
it but again

763
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:16,879
uh here software different radio allows

764
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:20,559
you to sequence

765
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:22,159
uh pulses using uh an updated firmware

766
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:23,520
in this case it's a red pitaya the red

767
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:26,640
pitaya is taking care

768
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:28,320
of sequencing all the uh sec all the

769
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:30,880
pulses needed for radar signal

770
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:32,158
transposition to a radio frequency band

771
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:34,640
is done by

772
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:36,480
feeding a switch with a voltage control

773
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,760
oscillator and an iq demodulator of

774
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,760
course the red pita is only

775
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:41,039
taking care of baseband and this is the

776
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,559
kind of of

777
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:44,240
processing stream that we have in red

778
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:46,799
pitaya generating

779
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:48,640
the various uh start of set top offset

780
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:52,400
to generate the pulses that will be

781
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:55,200
streaming pulse radar so in this example

782
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:57,279
we can have a radar system with a pulse

783
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:59,600
repetition rate of about 250 kilos

784
00:23:57,279 --> 00:24:01,440
hertz and this is again the kind of

785
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,799
update rate that would not be feasible

786
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:05,279
with an oscilloscope

787
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:06,080
collecting data to be processed and why

788
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:08,080
would you need

789
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:09,439
such a high pulse repetition rate in

790
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:12,240
this particular case

791
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,720
we are probing acoustic sensors so these

792
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,559
are

793
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,840
radio frequency sensors acting as

794
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:18,720
cooperative targets

795
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:19,840
what kind of sensor would need 250 kilo

796
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,520
sample per second

797
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:22,879
well actually vibration sensor if you're

798
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:24,879
looking at strain gauge

799
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:26,559
uh in this case we have a strain gauge

800
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,080
glue to a tuning fork

801
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:29,678
and if you hit the tuning photographer

802
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,960
with a hammer of course you've got the

803
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:32,799
440 hertz

804
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:34,000
main mode but thanks to the high

805
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:36,879
sampling frequency

806
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:39,200
you can see modes up to 40 kilohertz our

807
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:40,000
bandwidth is up to 125 kilogram per

808
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,159
second

809
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,760
now i'm not saying that pulse radar is

810
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:45,840
the right way of doing a radar of course

811
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:46,960
frequency swipe radar much more elegant

812
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:49,600
and much more beautiful

813
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:51,440
but a frequency swap radar or correlated

814
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:53,918
radar with noise radar will never

815
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:55,679
achieve 250 kilohertz uh update rate

816
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:57,200
only post radar to my knowledge will

817
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:57,600
achieve such high pulse repetition rate

818
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,279
so

819
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:01,360
in this particular case where we wanted

820
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:03,840
high measurement bandwidth we went for

821
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:06,320
this pulse radar approach

822
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:07,840
and finally to the last presentation the

823
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,960
last demonstration is phase noise

824
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,080
measurement phase noise is the

825
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:12,640
characteristics

826
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:14,559
of the stability so if you remember that

827
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:16,480
phase is the integral of frequency

828
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:18,158
if you look at the phase fluctuation of

829
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,799
your oscillator over a given bandwidth

830
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:21,520
so that's

831
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:22,240
phase fluctuation over one hertz uh bin

832
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,559
size

833
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:26,400
then you characterize how your

834
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:27,440
oscillator how stable your oscillator is

835
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,279
so let's say you have a reference

836
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:30,880
oscillator you have a device under test

837
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:32,159
you don't care about the carrier you

838
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,200
just want to know what is happening

839
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:35,600
around the carrier

840
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,559
so you need to mix it and because this

841
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,639
guy is going to

842
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:40,559
continuously move respect to this guy

843
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:42,559
you need a feedback to control

844
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:44,559
uh and and keep your reference

845
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:46,320
oscillator uh running after the device

846
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:47,279
memory test this is your analog approach

847
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,960
to cancel

848
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:50,720
uh the carrier it's got a lot of

849
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,039
problems uh my colleagues are experts in

850
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,799
this

851
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:54,720
you've got fluctuations due to the to

852
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:56,799
the mixer here so we do a digital

853
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:59,440
approach so it's exactly the same story

854
00:25:56,799 --> 00:26:00,080
we collect a we collect b no feedback

855
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,919
loop

856
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:04,158
after a to d conversion everything is

857
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:06,720
digital so no bias no

858
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:07,600
drift we have the mixer with a local

859
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:10,799
oscillator

860
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:13,760
digital uh decimation

861
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:14,879
arc tangent unwrapping linear regression

862
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:17,679
fourier transform

863
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:18,159
and we send uh the phase uh fluctuation

864
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:19,840
so

865
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:21,600
this is actually what the kind what what

866
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:24,559
we do with e310

867
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:25,120
uh the x310 unfortunately x310 although

868
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:26,799
it's got

869
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:28,719
two times two a to the converter it can

870
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:31,440
only stream complex values so we need

871
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:32,320
uh two x310 to do this kind of

872
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:34,720
measurement

873
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:35,840
and here again is what we implement in

874
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:38,159
the x310

875
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:38,959
uh to get this kind of face so the curve

876
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:40,960
here

877
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:42,799
looks smooth uh it's it's actually a

878
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:44,559
very uh consistent with

879
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:46,960
professional hardware from agilent or

880
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:48,799
rodent shards and what you have here is

881
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:50,640
the phase fluctuation as a function of

882
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:51,440
the offset to the to the carrier

883
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,279
frequency so

884
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:55,440
again this is a kind of measurement

885
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:57,120
where you have a 50k

886
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:59,679
instrument from rod and schwarz or

887
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:02,719
agilent which is pretty well implemented

888
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:04,080
with uh two usrp here so just to show

889
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:06,640
you a little bit what we're doing

890
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:08,960
in our custom hardware and what i would

891
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:10,559
like to emphasize is all these guys here

892
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,840
uh we did a presentation last year at

893
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:12,639
the international frequency control

894
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,080
symposium

895
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:15,919
uh if you look at the road and charge

896
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,960
system they will hide all of these for

897
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:18,799
you so whatever is

898
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:20,000
uh these spikes they consider them noise

899
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:21,679
and they will just uh

900
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,200
smooth it for you actual rodent schwarz

901
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:24,640
is not that bad because they have a mode

902
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,240
in which they still give you the raw

903
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:28,159
data but the display data

904
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:29,360
has been spoofed so the osc is very

905
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:31,760
beautiful charts

906
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:32,879
but phase noise always has this this

907
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:34,799
previous

908
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:36,480
information so that concludes my

909
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:38,240
presentation i wanted to show a little

910
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:40,080
bit how sdr could be used

911
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:41,520
beyond radio frequency communication

912
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,720
especially digital radio frequency

913
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:44,480
communication

914
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:46,240
i wanted to show how you could use

915
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:47,919
readily available hardware

916
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:49,440
radio frequency oscilloscopes i wanted

917
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:52,480
to see to show you

918
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:54,080
how we could enable in

919
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:56,880
measurements that would not be feasible

920
00:27:54,080 --> 00:28:00,000
without software from radio hardware

921
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:00,559
um and all these topics will be expanded

922
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,919
a bit of

923
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:04,158
advertisement although there's been a

924
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:06,000
plenty of it uh during this session

925
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:07,279
during the european new radio days uh

926
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,960
con call from the episode

927
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:12,080

keynote speech which was given last year

936
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:30,559
by marcus

937
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:31,360
on the internals of the scheduler of new

938
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:34,639
radio

939
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:35,080
this year will be given by uh the author

940
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:38,159
of

941
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:41,600
gnssdr uh carlos fernandez from

942
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:44,240
universe from the technical university

943
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:46,559
on communication of catalunya

944
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:48,159
of spain so he will be given the genes

945
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:49,918
sdr is one of the head

946
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:51,279
one of our complex software for global

947
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:54,480
navigation satellite system

948
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:56,640
processing heavily relying on new radio

949
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:58,000
so if you're interested uh austrian

950
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:01,520
digital was already presented

951
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:03,919
near a gr oscilloscope and it's 3.8 port

952
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:05,679
and for the french-speaking audience you

953
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:07,679
can find the details of the article

954
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:13,840
in the current linux magazine and with

955
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:13,840
that i thank you for attention

956
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:23,360
you
