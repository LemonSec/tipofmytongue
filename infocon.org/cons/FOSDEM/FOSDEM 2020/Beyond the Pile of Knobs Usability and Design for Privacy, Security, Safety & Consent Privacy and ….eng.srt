1
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:09,840
okay

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:12,799
buzzers i hear buzzers excellent um

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,080
okay hi everybody uh i'm georgia bolin i

4
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:14,639
am the executive director at simply

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,320
secure

6
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:18,080
um i'm going to talk today about some of

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,600
our work around designing with

8
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:22,799
tools that are focused on safety and

9
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:24,320
security and designing with that in mind

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,680
so simply secure if you haven't heard of

11
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:31,119
us we are a 501c3 nonprofit in the u.s

12
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:33,840
and our mission is to support capacity

13
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:34,239
education and capacity building in sort

14
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,719
of the

15
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:37,360
intersection of vulnerable populations

16
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:39,680
design

17
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,800
and usability so we believe everyone

18
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,320
deserves technology they

19
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,000
they can trust and that that is

20
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,920
something that we can be designing

21
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,840
for designing to protect people's safety

22
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,920
and privacy

23
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,120
so how do we do that um to do a just

24
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,120
quick intro to us

25
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,320
we sort of have three main types of work

26
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,680
that we do um

27
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,239
one and the biggest one and what i'll

28
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:00,000
talk about most today is we do direct

29
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:02,399
design support and ux support for

30
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,119
projects so that means user research

31
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,159
wireframing testing things like that we

32
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:07,760
also do some of our own

33
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:09,680
independent research and we publish as

34
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,880
much of that as open resources and tools

35
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,960
available to the community

36
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,479
as we can they're on our knowledge base

37
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,479
on our website

38
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:17,759
and lastly we try to run community

39
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:20,080
events so

40
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:21,600
um in the last year we did a week-long

41
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,880
residency where people came and worked

42
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:26,240
on their projects with us

43
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:28,399
and other mentors we've run workshops on

44
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,679
human rights center design and ai or

45
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,720
human rights center design

46
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:34,320
and technology generally so things like

47
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,320
that

48
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,479
so the challenge which probably all of

49
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:40,479
you feel hopefully all of you feel

50
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:42,159
is privacy and security and safety are

51
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:44,000
critical most teams

52
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:45,520
um open source projects might not lack

53
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,880
designing ux capacity

54
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:50,079
and the challenges that all of you are

55
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:52,079
facing are complex and overwhelming

56
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:53,600
for the developers honestly as much as

57
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:55,439
the designers a lot of the time

58
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,880
and the users right and so the goal is

59
00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:00,000
to try and solve those problems

60
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:01,280
so how can we try and design for safety

61
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,399
you're in the design room so hopefully

62
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,159
this is something you agree with but

63
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:05,680
focusing on user needs

64
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:08,080
so we take a human center design

65
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,440
approach but we add a level around

66
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,680
to thinking about threat modeling and

67
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:14,239
risk which i'll talk about

68
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,680
um and so that sort of comes from two

69
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:17,120
aspects one is the

70
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,879
how does the technology or product

71
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,879
affect someone's safety

72
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:22,640
how is it is it being introduced to help

73
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:24,480
but is it also potentially introducing

74
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:26,160
new challenges like

75
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,238
if you're collecting data you are

76
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:30,000
introducing risk to your system

77
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:31,519
to the people like who is holding that

78
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,160
data what's happening

79
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:35,280
um are they expected to use it in ways

80
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,640
that we

81
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,400
that might introduce risk in their lives

82
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,000
that we don't totally understand

83
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,560
and a lot of what matters there is

84
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,760
context so our design choices can cause

85
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,800
security holes

86
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:49,599
uh confused people create workarounds um

87
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,519
if we like over preach or try and push

88
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:53,359
people to do exactly what we want to do

89
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:55,040
they can get annoyed and tune it out and

90
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,040
walk away

91
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,799
and people will do there's a lot of

92
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,159
research that suggests that people will

93
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,519
do whatever they can to not have to

94
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:05,280
think about security in depth

95
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:06,959
so you might be saying how can i start

96
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,640
to do anything about this

97
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:10,239
uh and so some of you some of these

98
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,440
slides um if you came last year with

99
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:12,400
molly some of these you may have seen

100
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,519
before but the

101
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:17,760
our secret sauce suggestion is to do ux

102
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:19,519
research and design research

103
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,359
you can do that remotely but talking to

104
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:23,280
people figuring out what their needs are

105
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,200
understanding the context in which they

106
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,680
work and getting that feedback and

107
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,920
feeding

108
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,200
back into the process understanding how

109
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,879
people

110
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:33,200
their mental models for the how the

111
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:34,798
tools work so a lot of times especially

112
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,599
the closer you are to the tool that

113
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:37,440
you're building

114
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:39,599
uh which if how many people in here work

115
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:43,440
on an open source project

116
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:45,200
yeah okay thanks to all of you um we

117
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,879
we forget how close we are to it and how

118
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,399
well we understand that and so it's

119
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:49,040
really important to talk to people and

120
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,760
understand

121
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,879
what of that matches um because that

122
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,159
helps you understand

123
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:55,200
the difference between what you know

124
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:56,400
about the way it should work and the

125
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,159
design from the way people are

126
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,519
understanding it in the interface

127
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:01,599
um there's a lot of there's some folks

128
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:04,000
that sometimes think like oh the users

129
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:05,359
are wrong and we need to fix it for them

130
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,080
or we need to teach them how it should

131
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,879
work um i vehemently disagree with that

132
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,120
concept

133
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:12,640
people learn technology in so many

134
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,080
different ways and we need to figure out

135
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,359
the gaps between how they've gotten

136
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,359
there what they might know

137
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,639
and what we're trying to support them

138
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:19,918
with doing with technology

139
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:21,280
and find a way to meet in the middle and

140
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:23,280
that has to do with onboarding that has

141
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:25,520
to do with design

142
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:27,198
ux generally but one of the great ways

143
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,799
to start is to say like

144
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:30,479
what do you think this does how does it

145
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,360
work talk me through your process

146
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:34,960
watch them use it um watching people use

147
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,080
tools

148
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,198
lots of people have trouble with this

149
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,719
because if you sit next to someone

150
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:40,160
watching them use your tool you want to

151
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,680
tell them how to do it and show them

152
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,960
what they're doing and it's really hard

153
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,479
to watch people stumble through stuff

154
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,758
but it's really valuable to get good

155
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:47,359
feedback about

156
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:49,040
what you thought made sense and totally

157
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:52,160
doesn't to the person

158
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:53,759
so we suggest actually talking to people

159
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,600
doing those interviews and observing as

160
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:57,360
much as you can

161
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,759
a big piece of this too is to understand

162
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,919
their context so tools need to work for

163
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:03,039
all of your users in all contexts we're

164
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:04,960
kind of always

165
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:07,680
it's it's a sort of standard practice to

166
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:10,560
design for the best case solution

167
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,840
but the reality is people aren't always

168
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,840
their best selves when they're trying to

169
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,599
use your tools they might be in a rush

170
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,039
they might be under stress for any

171
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,680
variety of reasons

172
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:21,280
so this is a quote more around like the

173
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,240
terms and conditions accept buttons that

174
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,559
we see

175
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,759
every day on every website like i know i

176
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,199
should read these terms and conditions

177
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:27,759
but i just really need to do this right

178
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:29,120
now i'm up

179
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:31,680
you know i'm applying for my benefits

180
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,840
i'm applying for a job i'm applying for

181
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:36,400
a grant like

182
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:37,520
accept we've all done it we know other

183
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,638
people have done it

184
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,799
you can't assume that people are going

185
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:42,720
to take the time um and because

186
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,720
it's just not the reality right there

187
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:47,520
they have other things other goals that

188
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:49,520
have nothing to do with that experience

189
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:51,039
um we do some projects we've done some

190
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:53,120
projects working with journalists

191
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:54,080
and so they'll have this is a specific

192
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,639
context that has

193
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:58,400
specific needs so if you're working if

194
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:00,160
journalists might be some of your users

195
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,840
they need to know that their sources and

196
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,520
their information are safe so if they're

197
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:05,520
putting data into a system

198
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,799
how are they protected how is that

199
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:09,599
system protecting

200
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:11,199
the source itself a lot of them will

201
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,440
avoid using any types of tools and

202
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:14,800
systems because they don't trust

203
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,400
anything other than what they can keep

204
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,880
in their possession or what they

205
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:20,318
understand

206
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,400
sort of on a very different type of

207
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:24,080
context this is an early career

208
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,560
researcher in academics

209
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:28,318
uh and talking about harassment and

210
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,880
bullying and the threat of

211
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:31,919
retaliation from within the community on

212
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,360
a tool so they're

213
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:34,960
they're really worried they really like

214
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,560
the fact that this tool asks them to

215
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,159
review the code of conduct every time

216
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,680
because it helps them remember

217
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,520
that the community is intended to be

218
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,120
safe and constructive and so if we're

219
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:45,039
actually creating that friction point

220
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,880
asking people to

221
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:48,800
do you did you actually adhere to the

222
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,400
code of conduct

223
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:53,360
that actually helps this person feel

224
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:55,440
safer on the system

225
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,440
so user research can help you develop

226
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:59,280
concepts of who your users are

227
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,880
sometimes called personas it can help

228
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,198
you understand the journey that they

229
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,560
take through the tools and help you

230
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:06,479
understand where you can provide better

231
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,960
controls to give people

232
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:10,000
that transparency and that agency to

233
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,318
make changes

234
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,440
or to to review their data to review

235
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:16,639
what permissions they've set

236
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:18,479
things like that so our big uh

237
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:20,000
advice of most projects is don't just

238
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:21,359
focus on the majority a lot of times

239
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,400
we're saying like oh how can we solve

240
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,800
the problem for the most

241
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,400
people but if you actually focus on the

242
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,120
stress cases the people who are in the

243
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,719
most

244
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,120
like high risk settings what works for

245
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,240
them

246
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:36,000
is likely to work for most people and so

247
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,440
if you can solve that problem well

248
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,720
you can actually probably support your

249
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:43,680
entire user base well

250
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:45,039
um that didn't that cut off funny but

251
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,560
yeah so a lot of this starts with asking

252
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:47,199
like who actually are your users what

253
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,520
are their needs

254
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,800
what challenges do they have now um and

255
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,440
one thing i'd like to throw in there and

256
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,560
this came up

257
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,800
as i've been talking to projects

258
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,160
recently is you actually probably have a

259
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,759
lot of data a lot of people don't know

260
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,120
where to start like

261
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:00,960
okay i don't know how to contact my

262
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,560
users they might actually already be

263
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:05,359
contacting you every day

264
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:07,759
through support forums discussion uh

265
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,360
platforms like chats

266
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:12,160
and depending on the type of tool you're

267
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:14,080
building like developers or users too

268
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,199
and they you know you can look at the

269
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:18,800
challenges that they have

270
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:20,400
as well so um

271
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,840
yeah so users need transparency and

272
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,960
controls to evaluate the changes they

273
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:25,359
need to make

274
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,479
so we're big on on good starting with

275
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,240
good defaults

276
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:29,599
um but making sure that it's things that

277
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,919
then people know how to do something

278
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:32,159
with

279
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:33,120
so this quote comes from an interview we

280
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:36,399
were doing where

281
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:38,000
um a user is allowed to change their

282
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:38,799
profile and i'll show a screenshot of

283
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,200
this in a minute

284
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:42,718
but my pseudonym keeps me safe safe if i

285
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,680
need to change my account name i know

286
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:46,959
that i can do that in the profile

287
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,640
so starting with that good default

288
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:51,359
allows people to opt in rather than

289
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:53,120
forcing them to opt out

290
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,399
so let's talk about some examples more

291
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,040
specifics uh

292
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:58,320
so last year and if folks here were at

293
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:01,040
um

294
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,720
at camp the chaos camp in the summer you

295
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,480
might have seen my colleagues molly and

296
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,920
eileen talk about this project

297
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,600
um but over the summer last summer we

298
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,719
worked with noscript people familiar

299
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,760
with noscript

300
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:13,839
raise hands nodding okay cool great um

301
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,880
so if you've used noscript and you think

302
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:17,360
yourself

303
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,480
a a pretty good technical person um

304
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,080
you've probably still been really

305
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,200
frustrated because it's hard it sort of

306
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,480
seems like it's geared

307
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,880
towards a really specialized set of

308
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,680
knowledge um we've talked to a lot of

309
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,040
people and there

310
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,439
their answer was when i can't tell if

311
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:31,760
it's working i just turn it off

312
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,040
so it's strict by default it's meant to

313
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,880
be interactive it's not something you

314
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:37,439
can set and forget

315
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:39,040
and it's actually sort of intending to

316
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,360
be a place to create friction to have

317
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,519
you

318
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,760
question you know how this tool is what

319
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:46,320
you want actually on a website to load

320
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:48,160
um so for the challenges it's got too

321
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,920
many confusing choices there are terms

322
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,360
that are contradictory in the interface

323
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:53,519
and it's hard for users to know

324
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,680
what settings will just work and

325
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:59,360
actually protect them

326
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:02,239
so we worked with giorgio the

327
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:03,040
maintainer and did lots of prototyping

328
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,880
work we

329
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:06,560
made like high fidelity mockups we

330
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,519
interviewed people interviewing people

331
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:10,640
allowed us to

332
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:11,519
create sort of three core personas so a

333
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,360
super user

334
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:15,360
a privacy advocate and someone who's

335
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:17,440
just curious about

336
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,560
how they can be protecting themselves

337
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,800
better online

338
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,839
um we also looked at other ads and

339
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,680
script blockers

340
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:25,600
uh we analyzed the data that we were

341
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:28,640
seeing from the way um

342
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,920
the way noscript works uh and we kept

343
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:32,000
iterating on prototypes because it was

344
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,360
just such a complex system we actually i

345
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,880
don't have it in this presentation but

346
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,560
if you go watch the talk

347
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:39,040
from camp over the summer which is

348
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:40,959
linked and these are i will be online

349
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:44,399
but that is linked from that

350
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:46,000
blog post i we actually have models of

351
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:48,000
the flow of the different options

352
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,279
and choices it's very complicated there

353
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,440
are many ways you can

354
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:54,320
you can actually block a site or script

355
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:57,360
or use it in one instance or another

356
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:59,040
but our main takeaway was uh people who

357
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,760
want we need to figure out how to make

358
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,719
those controls easier for people to

359
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,319
navigate

360
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,079
on a basic level and then easy to

361
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,279
configure for power users and so those

362
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:10,239
are sort of the two

363
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:10,640
primary audiences that we aimed for

364
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,160
because

365
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,839
it's not that noscript is keeping you

366
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,319
safe specifically or makes browsing

367
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:17,200
easier

368
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:19,040
or it's just working for power users

369
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,440
like the idea is that noscript buys

370
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:23,040
you time to make informed decisions

371
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:26,240
about who you want to trust

372
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:28,719
so it's starts as strict and backs off

373
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,399
so hopefully this is coming soon um i

374
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:33,279
know giorgio is working on it

375
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:34,800
uh but we i made it so that you we

376
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:36,399
actually introduced a new feature which

377
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,079
is that you can have settings on a

378
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:41,200
per-site basis

379
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:42,640
so you don't just always have to block a

380
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,399
script that might appear on multiple

381
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,720
sites you might need it on some right

382
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:46,079
like

383
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,760
on the new york times you might need the

384
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:50,000
new york times as scripts

385
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,959
um if that's what you want to be doing

386
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,160
so uh

387
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:54,319
that's sort of a new feature that was

388
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:57,360
introduced by this um you have

389
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:59,760
sort of clear fine-tuning hopefully

390
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,519
and ways to just turn it off when

391
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:04,560
nothing's working the way you want

392
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:06,079
and move forward at your own risk

393
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:08,319
so hopefully that will actually be ruled

394
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:10,000
out sometime this year

395
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,240
another project i'll just talk about

396
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,639
quickly is one that um this is in the

397
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,639
open

398
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:16,560
science space that's called pre-review

399
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:17,680
preview is a platform for crowdsourcing

400
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,199
pre-print reviews

401
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:21,279
i'm happy to talk about that more later

402
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:23,120
if anyone wants to dig in on the science

403
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:25,680
part but basically it's like

404
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,480
early research so drafts of papers

405
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,000
before they

406
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:30,560
are fully accepted and published by a

407
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,040
journal and so the idea of the tool

408
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:34,160
is to create and cultivate more open

409
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,760
feedback in science

410
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,279
and supporting the development of

411
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:40,000
expertise in

412
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:41,760
in open peer review so it's a totally

413
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,240
new process there are no tools in this

414
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,639
space

415
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,720
at all yet um and so we actually have

416
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:49,120
been playing with two iterations

417
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,399
which are linked up there many

418
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,360
researchers are still learning how to

419
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:54,399
work in the open

420
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:56,240
at all i think it's there's been a long

421
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:58,240
i don't think openness in science is new

422
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,680
but there's a adoption of openness and

423
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,519
sciences

424
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,800
growing in popularity i'm seeing some

425
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:05,440
nodding from folks who seem

426
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:06,240
familiar with that generally no matter

427
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,720
who you talk to

428
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,560
researchers main fear is retaliation

429
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:12,959
from others so if they give a

430
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:14,479
strong critique of something they are

431
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,279
worried that people will find some way

432
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,600
to attack them

433
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:19,439
either in the feedback processes

434
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,040
themselves or

435
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,720
through other channels right it's a

436
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:24,319
small community and network people

437
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:27,360
look for jobs have grad students that

438
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:30,320
sort of thing so there's lots of ways to

439
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,680
be bad actors in the space these are

440
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,519
just some screenshots of the tool

441
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:36,479
there's a browser extension

442
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:37,839
for the rapid pre-review which is this

443
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,720
what these screenshots are from it's the

444
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:41,839
outbreak science

445
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:44,720
link um and it has a little like

446
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:45,680
it lets you read a paper and write

447
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,079
reviews which is

448
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,880
it's very early beta i'll put it that

449
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:50,719
way

450
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:52,079
um this is a tool where anonymity is

451
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,040
something we've been playing with a lot

452
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:54,719
so

453
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,480
at the moment this is a screenshot from

454
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,160
the profile

455
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:00,399
users can actually switch back and forth

456
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,680
between their anonymous user and a user

457
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:03,920
id that's tied

458
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:05,519
to an identity system called orc id if

459
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:08,000
you're familiar with it

460
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:09,680
and so this is something that we've i

461
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,279
we're just trying to put some stuff out

462
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,800
and get feedback so it's in really early

463
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:14,000
stages but it's an interesting idea that

464
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,319
you can actually

465
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,079
swap when you're working in the open or

466
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:20,639
when you want to work anonymously

467
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:22,239
you can swap back and so you're you have

468
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:25,519
a context of

469
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:27,279
your anonymity status and your actions

470
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:28,639
that can apply in certain contexts which

471
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:29,839
makes it really complicated

472
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:31,600
but is meant to be something that

473
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:33,120
enables people to interact in this

474
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,160
community in ways that they can feel

475
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,519
safe

476
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:38,000
and hopefully geared towards everybody

477
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:39,760
working in the open but allowing them to

478
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,160
start from a place where they feel more

479
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,160
secure

480
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:45,279
some stuff that we're working on right

481
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,479
now just in the interest of time but

482
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:46,959
things if you want to talk to us about

483
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,240
it

484
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:50,079
uh we are working on improving the

485
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,160
usability of python um

486
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:53,519
the pep cli tool so if you're a python

487
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:56,639
user and want to chat with us you can

488
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:59,360
talk to me or bernard

489
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:00,079
and uh yeah and that's i highlight that

490
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,680
mostly to

491
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:03,040
to make the point that developers are

492
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,719
users too and we can be thinking about

493
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,319
usability in those contexts and there's

494
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,720
a lot of security challenges that come

495
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,839
up

496
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,240
so like one of the things in that

497
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:14,480
project that we will be looking at is

498
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:14,720
um uh how the dependency resolver works

499
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,839
and

500
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,760
making sure that people know that the

501
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:18,160
packages they're pulling together are

502
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,639
all

503
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:22,800
safe packages that might not have issues

504
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:25,279
we've been working with aura design

505
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,319
and the global leaks team to improve the

506
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:28,880
whistleblowing

507
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:30,320
and admin interfaces of that tool we're

508
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,759
working with some funders to make it

509
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:34,000
easier to apply for money

510
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:35,680
i hope that starts to help all of you if

511
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,120
you're people who apply to funding so

512
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,160
we're working with the moss program at

513
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:41,680
mozilla

514
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:42,639
and the open technology fund um and then

515
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,479
we're doing some work around this

516
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:45,199
information and working with tor around

517
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,959
metrics

518
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:48,240
um so that's some stuff that's coming up

519
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:49,518
if you have are interested in any of

520
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:52,560
those i'm happy to talk about it more

521
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:55,600
after um and as i mentioned we have a

522
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:57,439
knowledge base on our website and

523
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:59,920
included a link here to like a ux

524
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,880
starter pack so if there's

525
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,319
if you just want to be able to read

526
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,759
through some resources if you're getting

527
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,199
started with user research for the first

528
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:07,360
time or with user research with high

529
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:09,199
risk users for the first time

530
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,880
that's a good link to start with i'll

531
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:13,040
leave that for a second

532
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:14,560
um and i think i wanted to leave the

533
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,439
rest of the time for questions because

534
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:17,920
we have

535
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:19,519
a little over five minutes yes okay um

536
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,319
do i realize that that was just a super

537
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:22,480
quick

538
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,240
set of how we approach it what we do but

539
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,440
this is me i'll leave this link i'll

540
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,920
leave that link up but

541
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:29,920
um questions because i covered a lot of

542
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:36,160
things very quickly

543
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:39,040
yeah thank you

544
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:40,399
so if you've got a question shoot your

545
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:44,560
hand up and if you can

546
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:44,560
repeat the question for the yeah

547
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:51,839
no questions

548
00:16:55,519 --> 00:17:00,880
yeah i hope so um we

549
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:02,800
are we need to do some fundraising to be

550
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,600
able to run it again um but we are

551
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,760
hoping to

552
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,760
and what we've been trying to do is feed

553
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:10,559
sort of the experience that we

554
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:11,199
did in the residency into workshops so

555
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:14,240
um

556
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:15,679
there's a uh yeah into along these lines

557
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:18,959
we run a community slack

558
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:20,480
so if and i realize it's on slack but

559
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:22,319
um if you're working in the space and

560
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:23,919
want access to folks in the community to

561
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:25,839
ask questions or just find out about

562
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:27,839
interesting opportunities um

563
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:29,440
i will i should have added the link here

564
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:32,159
but it's i have a

565
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,880
short link that is i think anyways i can

566
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,520
pull it up

567
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,960
but um i can also just add you on my

568
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,639
phone right now if you want

569
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,160
um we've also been trying to do a little

570
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,960
bit more organizing around human rights

571
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,600
center design

572
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:45,520
tech and security design uh so we have a

573
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:47,520
mailing list for that as well

574
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,879
so i'm happy to add folks to those if

575
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,080
those are things that you want to

576
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,240
know what's coming up but we're trying

577
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:54,240
to do things at events where people are

578
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:55,840
um so maybe at fosterm next year could

579
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,919
be cool uh

580
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,959
but we there will be something there'll

581
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:00,799
be stuff at wright's con

582
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,799
if you go to rightscon we're thinking

583
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:04,320
about allied media conference

584
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:05,918
and internet freedom festival or some of

585
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:08,399
the ones that we're looking at this year

586
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:10,559
so iff at the moment where hopefully

587
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:12,720
we'll have like two days of

588
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:14,799
kind of like design jam workshops that

589
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:16,799
maybe if any of you will be at iff

590
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:18,400
or at least in valencia around that time

591
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:19,840
um hopefully that can be like a mini

592
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,600
residency type of thing

593
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:23,120
but yeah we're hoping to we've just been

594
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,879
trying to do it in

595
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:28,239
um formats that we haven't had to

596
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:28,240
fundraise for that way

597
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:48,559
yeah so the question is about scale like

598
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,280
how many interviews to get enough

599
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:53,360
information

600
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:55,760
for different um persona types uh so

601
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:57,280
the terrible answer is it depends um and

602
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,799
the other terrible answer is we do

603
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:01,678
what we can based on the resources we

604
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:02,639
have so in the no script case i think we

605
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:05,760
did a total

606
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:07,280
of um about five pre-interviews just

607
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,720
like talking to people understanding

608
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,559
if they already used it and what they do

609
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:12,640
and challenges they have and that we

610
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:14,639
tried to we did a mix of existing users

611
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:17,520
and people who had never seen it before

612
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,919
um and then uh on like a totally

613
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,000
different

614
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:21,360
we did testing with a handful more so

615
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,799
probably in total we got feedback from

616
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,719
about 10 people

617
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:26,720
but that was still super helpful there

618
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:28,320
was pretty consistent alignment in that

619
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,679
so we felt pretty confident about where

620
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,120
we were going with it

621
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:32,880
um with some of the work that we're

622
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:34,559
doing around like the funding

623
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,160
issues um there we're getting closer to

624
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:38,240
like 20 interviews and it's partly

625
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:39,840
because there are just so many different

626
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:42,640
groups of people that they're trying to

627
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:44,959
serve so we try to scale it based on

628
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:47,039
the diversity of focus if that makes

629
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:49,200
sense um but yeah

630
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:50,559
sort of a yeah i was wondering you very

631
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:53,440
quickly

632
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:54,799
remote uh yeah yeah and i was wondering

633
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,640
would you comment a bit on that like

634
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:57,280
what are limitations in terms of types

635
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,679
of research

636
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:00,799
and how do you deal with less tech savvy

637
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:02,720
yeah yeah

638
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:04,799
we've had a lot of pretty good luck

639
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:07,440
using like things like jitsi and zoom

640
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:09,200
for remote sessions or google meet

641
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,799
whatever whatever the video conferencing

642
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,080
tool that the people we're talking to

643
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:13,760
are comfortable with and we try to meet

644
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,720
them at those platforms sometimes we use

645
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,080
whereby

646
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:19,200
just whatever the video conferencing

647
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:20,879
tool is the challenge there is that

648
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,559
yeah if anything goes wrong technically

649
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:25,280
like some things won't work

650
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:26,480
uh on the pre-review science project we

651
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,280
were talking to someone and for some

652
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,280
reason there were

653
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:31,120
tons of bugs that happened in safari and

654
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:32,799
they were safari user and we didn't

655
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:34,719
um we couldn't figure out what's going

656
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:37,440
on and it kind of like made the whole

657
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:38,880
interview go a little bit awry um but

658
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,320
then we also that helped us find some

659
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:43,280
bugs that we didn't know about

660
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:43,760
so we kind of try to roll with it a bit

661
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,440
the other

662
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,799
the problem we've run into the most is

663
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:49,440
if you're using tools

664
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:51,440
if you're testing tools that have a key

665
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:53,840
like login stage

666
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:55,280
people usually everybody stores their

667
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:57,360
passwords differently i could write a

668
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:58,720
whole separate research paper about that

669
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:01,199
just based on interviews we've been

670
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:03,039
doing is people have to log in

671
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,480
and that can be challenging because a

672
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:05,840
lot of people are nervous they're like

673
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,520
scared to show you what they do

674
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:09,439
and so just trying to be supportive

675
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:11,120
around it's okay like i'm not looking

676
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:13,679
like i don't mind how you do it and just

677
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:14,000
sort of let them not feel bad about how

678
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:15,840
they

679
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,960
store their data that can be that's sort

680
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,840
of the main thing i would say where

681
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,679
we've run into

682
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:21,678
interesting people will like turn off

683
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:22,480
the screen share to log into a system

684
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:24,000
and then

685
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:26,320
um turn it back on once they feel

686
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,159
comfortable that type of thing

687
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:29,840
um but yeah it's been i think the

688
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:31,840
challenge more has been in people's

689
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:33,360
low latency environments so if they

690
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,639
don't have good connectivity and really

691
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,799
don't want to screen share

692
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:38,880
or don't want to be on video um the

693
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:40,960
video conversation just helps so much in

694
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:43,760
understanding emotions that are unsaid

695
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:45,200
right being able and being able to

696
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,480
support the person as they talk about

697
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,960
something that might be difficult or

698
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,880
might

699
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:50,400
relate to you know whatever is cause the

700
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:53,120
thing that causes them stress

701
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:54,640
so those aspects can be challenging but

702
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:57,120
it's still better than

703
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:58,799
not getting access to those people um or

704
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:00,479
only getting access to them in context

705
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:02,480
like this which can be

706
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,520
overwhelming in and of their own right

707
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:07,440
so yeah

708
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:12,320
hopefully that helps answer that yeah

709
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:15,520
any other questions one concise

710
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:18,158
question because we're going to uh

711
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:19,918
move the room for the next uh talk

712
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:21,520
anyone's got a nice short question to

713
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:23,919
ask

714
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,799
okay i was interested in that you've

715
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:27,120
worked on a

716
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:27,120
command

717
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:34,480
no no no it totally does i will say it

718
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:36,240
totally does one of the we're just

719
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,520
getting started um and bernardo and i

720
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:41,280
are working on this project together

721
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:42,879
um and uh i mean one of our big

722
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,280
questions has been like how are we going

723
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,520
to be

724
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,559
testing the new features so we have to

725
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,480
be set up with

726
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:50,480
test dev environments which means we

727
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,679
kind of have to onboard as developers to

728
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:53,840
be able to

729
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:56,080
run through all of that which could be a

730
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:58,639
project just on its own to like improve

731
00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:00,000
onboarding for developers um i have a

732
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,840
feeling we will end up giving them lots

733
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,080
of feedback on all of these things

734
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:05,918
um but yeah i mean i think the other big

735
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:07,280
piece in those types of projects and in

736
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:10,480
any big open source project

737
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:12,879
is there are so many pieces and we name

738
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:14,799
things in what seems right at the time

739
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:16,480
and that's really hard for like new

740
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:18,158
folks in the community no matter what if

741
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:21,600
they're users designers

742
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:23,200
developers right so trying to figure out

743
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,719
we could probably work on a million

744
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:26,400
things related to this project in the

745
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:28,159
next year but we only have

746
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,600
x amount of time so how do we make sure

747
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:30,880
we prioritize and like

748
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:33,120
log the right things to come back to

749
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:34,480
later maybe help with how that process

750
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,760
works out so that's kind of when we mean

751
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,840
capacity building thinking about

752
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:38,799
introducing processes to the teams to be

753
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,760
able to get that feedback more

754
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:41,279
consistently

755
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:43,279
but yeah i think we'll it'll be lots of

756
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:44,799
interesting challenges but we do have to

757
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:45,520
wear this like developer and designer

758
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:48,158
hat

759
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,559
which i think is fun but it means it's

760
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:50,640
hard

761
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:52,240
to sometimes approach projects like that

762
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:55,200
yeah

763
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:55,200
next year yeah

764
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:58,880
hopefully yeah yeah okay so thank you

765
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:05,840
very much

766
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:05,840
thank you

767
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,480
you
