1
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:14,799
so our next speaker

2
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:18,320
is boxley boxy is a master student at

3
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:21,520
eth zurich and but currently he has

4
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:23,439
exchanged it to you to delved

5
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:24,800
and he's one of the developers behind

6
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:26,720
the qtip

7
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,840
project which is an essential software

8
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,759
toolbox

9
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,119
for quantum simulations including the

10
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,000
noisy and

11
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:35,200
open quantum systems and today he's

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,360
going to be talking about

13
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,280
the outcome of this google summer of

14
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:41,680
code project

15
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:45,840
in a talk titled simulating quantum

16
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,840
noisy quantum devices with q-tip

17
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:51,839
hello can you hear me good yeah

18
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,600
thanks for the introduction so my name

19
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,480
is roxy

20
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,600
i am a google summer of code students

21
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,160
last year

22
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,960
and that's when i joined the qtip

23
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:04,238
community

24
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:08,000
for this project so

25
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:10,720
in this talk uh i'm going to

26
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,760
talk about a new module in q-tip that is

27
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,520
going to help you

28
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,040
stimulate your quantum chips your

29
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,920
quantum system

30
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:20,000
now if you were here last year you might

31
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:23,200
already heard a talk about q-tip

32
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,880
which was the general q-tip step given

33
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,200
by shannon watts

34
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,158
now in this talk we'll focus on this new

35
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,240
module

36
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:32,400
so i'll first still give a very brief

37
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,640
introduction of q-tip but only the

38
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,000
very central part and then we're coming

39
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,880
to this

40
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,880
new simulator

41
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:45,199
yeah so to begin with so today we have

42
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:47,439
a lot of different approaches that are

43
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:50,000
trying to build us quantum computers

44
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:51,039
so we have super conducting system

45
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,520
quantum dots

46
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:55,119
or some photonic platforms also iron

47
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,200
traps

48
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:59,520
they are all different kind of platforms

49
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,880
but in your quantum chips or what you

50
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,119
have in your system

51
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:06,719
it's a usually a very small quantum

52
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:08,639
system that we treat them as qubits

53
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:09,840
because everything here is quantum

54
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:12,119
that's why i want to

55
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,080
use them there's a lot of

56
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,120
counterintuitive phenomena happening

57
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,760
there

58
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,319
so one way of understanding your quantum

59
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,319
system

60
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:24,160
and study what is really happening in

61
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:24,160
your chips is by simulation

62
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:31,440
so q-tip as the name indicated the

63
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:34,000
quantum toolbox in python is exactly

64
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:36,879
this python package that help you to

65
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,599
understand your quantum system

66
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:41,040
we have a lot of different nice tools in

67
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:43,679
our package

68
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:45,120
ranging from some nice abstraction of

69
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,680
quantum operators

70
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,360
we call it q objects so we have a lot of

71
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,440
transformation function

72
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,879
which can transform between for example

73
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:57,200
choice operator

74
00:02:52,879 --> 00:03:00,159
or super operator which commonly used in

75
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,679
quantum information theory on the other

76
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:03,679
hand we also have many

77
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,120
predefined quantum states that can help

78
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,400
you to for example

79
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:11,440
set up your quantum simulation

80
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:13,519
and we also have nice realization tools

81
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,800
so like block sphere or weakness

82
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:17,680
function used in

83
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,000
optical system so they will help you

84
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,560
like

85
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,760
have a closer look or more intuitive

86
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,959
understand

87
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:28,798
of your quantum system but

88
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:32,319
those are very nice tools we have many

89
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:34,720
tons of them now the central part

90
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:36,159
that combines them and unites them

91
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:40,400
together is actually

92
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:40,399
the quantum dynamic silver of q-tip

93
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,400
so don't forget don't freak out this is

94
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:47,359
the only

95
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:49,040
page with formulas now what i want to

96
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,840
say is that

97
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:53,120
despite this eccentric behavior of

98
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,599
quantum

99
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,319
quantum physics we can still describe

100
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:58,959
sins

101
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:59,760
with physical laws so the neutral

102
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:01,439
equation

103
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,879
in the quantum world will be the

104
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:06,400
so-called trading

105
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:09,200
equation it basically means that if you

106
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:11,120
give your initial state and they'll give

107
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:13,599
something called the hamiltonian

108
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,480
which basically determines the dynamical

109
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:17,120
system

110
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,079
and you can actually calculate what kind

111
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:21,120
of state

112
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:22,960
am i having in the future now of course

113
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,280
it's never going to tell you what

114
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:28,638
exactly is the measurement results

115
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:30,960
because we still have this uncertainty

116
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:32,000
but it can describe your state your

117
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:35,840
physical system

118
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,240
in a statistical way now this works only

119
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,919
for

120
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:42,800
perfect isolated system but

121
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:44,240
in reality it's never the case so we are

122
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,880
trying very hard

123
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,960
to isolate our quantum system like we

124
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:50,320
put it in vacuum chamber or we could

125
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,719
temperature down to

126
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,440
some milk heaven but still there's

127
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,720
always that

128
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:58,160
environment around and this environment

129
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,840
will lead to something called

130
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,759
decoherence

131
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,840
so if you save your you store your

132
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:07,120
cubits in some kind of memory

133
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,599
and you come back like after a micro

134
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,960
second

135
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:13,600
or millisecond you marry it again then

136
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:15,359
probably you find out that it's the

137
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,919
state change it could become

138
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,120
from a drop from some state one to state

139
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:21,840
zero

140
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:24,639
so it means that your quantum system

141
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:27,359
actually talks to environment

142
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:28,960
so this kind of dissipative behavior is

143
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:32,080
captured by the so-called

144
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:33,198
lean blood master equation and the

145
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:36,840
silver

146
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:40,479
of this equation is the central part of

147
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:42,799
q-tip we also have a bunch of other

148
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:44,080
solvers some of them deal with a

149
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,759
slightly different

150
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,440
situation like if you have some

151
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:50,240
invariants in your system

152
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:51,120
but they are basically all designed and

153
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,800
used

154
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,800
for study quantum dynamics

155
00:05:54,880 --> 00:06:00,400
based on all those those silvers

156
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,000
um a lot of you know a lot of physics

157
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:05,120
phenomena can be studied like

158
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:08,080
quantum optics cavity qed

159
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,960
quantum optimum control and also the

160
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:12,159
topic today

161
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:13,440
quantum information processing

162
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,120
now when we talk about quantum

163
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,680
information processing we usually use

164
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,680
this

165
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:22,639
circuit model so q-tip also have this

166
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:24,880
very nice quantum circuitry station

167
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:28,000
where you can create a circuit

168
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:28,319
you can add gate to it so we have a lot

169
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,360
of

170
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:33,680
predefined quantum gate and we also

171
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:35,600
allow you to define your gates

172
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,520
your customized gates your own gates in

173
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,440
your matrix form

174
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,560
so when you round the gates you get the

175
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,600
final state

176
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,000
by matrix production but this part is

177
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,840
not

178
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,319
it's not new like you might also ask

179
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,318
that

180
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:52,319
we already have many many other

181
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:54,319
softwares that are doing this quantum

182
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:57,360
circuit simulation so we have

183
00:06:54,319 --> 00:07:01,520
quiz kit project q and

184
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:04,080
dozens of others what's the difference

185
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,359
now the difference here is that in q-tip

186
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:07,680
we are going to simulate

187
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:10,479
the circuits at the level of your

188
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:12,800
physics dynamics control pulse

189
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:13,758
so we will first transfer the quantum

190
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,479
circuits

191
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:18,240
into the control powers of some of our

192
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:19,758
device of a physics system

193
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,639
and then it simulates the physics

194
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:25,039
dynamics so our simulation

195
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:27,520
is running one level lower than the

196
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:30,479
circuit model

197
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,880
so with this i'll go to the second part

198
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:33,440
so

199
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:36,000
noise device simulation this new module

200
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,000
in q-tip

201
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:42,400
now imagine you have some quantum chip

202
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,000
and usually the way what you want to

203
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:46,960
control your

204
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,919
cubits is through some control pulse so

205
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,719
you either shy

206
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:53,120
laser on it or you give it some

207
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:55,599
microwave signal

208
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,479
so this kind of your quantum chip is

209
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:58,878
represented

210
00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:00,159
in our simulator calling a class called

211
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:02,720
processor

212
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:04,000
so it has information like number of

213
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:07,360
qubits

214
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,440
the typical relaxation time t1 t2

215
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,599
and also the most important your control

216
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:14,319
policies

217
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:16,560
so the control process is actually the

218
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:18,639
basic element in our simulation

219
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,680
so so it's characterized by the

220
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:21,919
hamiltonian

221
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,440
which describes the interaction and the

222
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:26,000
target qubits

223
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:27,199
and also the pulse coefficients and the

224
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,440
time sequence

225
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:31,520
so basically the last two the last two

226
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:34,159
here describes what kind of

227
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:36,240
shape is the pulse is going to have so

228
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:38,640
when do i want to turn the pulse out

229
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:41,360
and it does it has a rectangular shape

230
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:44,800
or triangular or even

231
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:48,080
even a gaussian shape so with this

232
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:49,199
you can define a device and add some

233
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,839
power straight

234
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:53,440
like i'm sure here is short code block

235
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:56,560
you have sigma

236
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:59,040
hamiltonian and act um cubic zero

237
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:00,959
with some house chip and then you can

238
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:03,839
you click run you run the state

239
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:04,800
or simulator tells you what desert state

240
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:08,080
looks like

241
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:10,560
at some future time t this

242
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:12,480
is less interesting if we are really

243
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:14,800
interested in the ideal case because

244
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:18,080
if you want to simulate ideal gate then

245
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:20,640
why don't just use the matrix

246
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,120
now since become interesting if we want

247
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:24,160
to add

248
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:26,800
noise so usually in those

249
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:28,640
gate based simulator the way of

250
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,399
simultaneous noise

251
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,319
is for example through some deep

252
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:33,200
polarizing channel we are assumed that

253
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,160
okay

254
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:38,000
a small part of a small part of the

255
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,560
small part information of my quantum

256
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,600
system

257
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:45,518
is lost after each gate

258
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:49,360
i say that okay i apply some flip error

259
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:52,000
with some probability p after each gate

260
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,399
but there's always an additional level

261
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,080
of

262
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:55,760
abstraction there so you have to

263
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,920
calculate these

264
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:01,040
which probability do i want to apply

265
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:01,040
this error gate

266
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:05,519
so in our case because we are doing this

267
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,760
simulation at the physics level

268
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:09,600
you don't need to worry this so because

269
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:12,160
we have an open system server

270
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,720
it is quite natural to aid like single

271
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,519
qubit

272
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,000
relaxation noise but beyond that you can

273
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:19,120
define

274
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
a lot of other kind of noise like pulse

275
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,480
shift noise

276
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
where your pulse is suffered from some

277
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:27,040
random amplitude noise

278
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,360
or maybe you have exponential tail

279
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,719
or for example your power it can happen

280
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:34,000
that your powers is

281
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:36,480
not very well focused so you

282
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,320
are you're trying to address one qubit

283
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,040
but because the pulse is a little bit

284
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,959
broader

285
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:43,439
you address actually several neighboring

286
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:45,599
qubits at the same time

287
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,480
there's also this so-called leakage

288
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,120
noise

289
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:51,040
where so basically we always imagine our

290
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,480
cubits to be a two level system that's

291
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:55,439
why i call it bit

292
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,000
but in fact even in a simple atom

293
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:59,279
there's

294
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
infinite many energy levels so we just

295
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:03,439
pick two of

296
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,839
them to use them as a as our qubit

297
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:07,440
but if your control part is not perfect

298
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:10,000
which is

299
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,680
usually the case it's very likely that

300
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,880
you can also excite

301
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:17,519
you can also accept excites your state

302
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:20,399
to some third level that is not even

303
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:22,640
captured in your cubic description

304
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:23,839
so in our simulation you can you can

305
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,240
easily define

306
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:29,279
uh characterize those kind of noise by

307
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:31,600
for example some ancillary level

308
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:34,000
so basically your qubit circuit is still

309
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,120
qubit but with a run simulation it

310
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,079
actually runs on

311
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,079
three level system

312
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:44,079
now with this pulse level control and

313
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:47,200
noise

314
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:50,479
you can basically characterize your chip

315
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:53,680
but then the the part that connects

316
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:56,880
the quantum circuit and the physics

317
00:11:53,680 --> 00:12:00,638
the physics dynamics is what we call

318
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:03,439
back-end and compiler so this part is

319
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:04,639
still under active development where we

320
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:07,120
aim at

321
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:07,920
create different back-end compilers for

322
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,800
different

323
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:11,120
common physics systems like those that

324
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:14,160
are

325
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:16,800
commonly used for quantum computing

326
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,519
so basically what a backend does in our

327
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,240
sense

328
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:21,040
is that you give it a parameter a few

329
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,240
parameters

330
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:26,639
like number of qubits or the frequency

331
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,760
of my resonator or my the frequency on

332
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:29,680
the ion trap

333
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,519
and then we construct the control

334
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,599
hamilton hamiltonians for you

335
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:37,279
automatically

336
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:38,880
so uh yeah basically it's a simulator be

337
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:39,439
careful it's a still simulator so

338
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,680
there's

339
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,880
no hardware no hardware backend we're

340
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:46,079
just simulating

341
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:47,600
different kind of physics system now on

342
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:50,000
the other hand

343
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,800
the compiler start from the quantum

344
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,440
circuit

345
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:54,719
and transfer find the corresponding

346
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:58,079
control powers

347
00:12:54,720 --> 00:13:01,120
that realize this circuit so

348
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:04,959
this helps those two you can basically

349
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:06,399
create some creates describe your

350
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:09,599
quantum device

351
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:11,600
with a few parameters and then you can

352
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:16,320
load some quantum circuits

353
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:18,560
defined in qt for example qt

354
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,360
circuit module and then you add some

355
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,599
noise to it

356
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,880
you run the simulation and you can see

357
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,440
how does this circuit

358
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:28,800
perform on this certain device maybe

359
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:31,760
even with some additional noise

360
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:34,479
so in a more illustrative way here is a

361
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:35,839
figure for the workflow so basically

362
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,839
what you can do is that

363
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:39,120
you choose some predefined backend and

364
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:40,800
compiler

365
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,040
and you give your quantum circuit as

366
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:45,599
input so the compiler

367
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:47,519
will then transfer your circuits into

368
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:51,040
the ideal control pulse

369
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:54,079
of this certain device and then

370
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:56,000
the noise object will add noise to this

371
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:58,959
control to those control powers

372
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,680
so you can have here for example phase a

373
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:03,518
pulse

374
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:06,479
shape noise or some additional noisy

375
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:07,600
noisy signal we then patch all those

376
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,079
things together

377
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,600
create a fixed model around it and send

378
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:14,160
it to the qtip server

379
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,680
the server will show you how is the

380
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:18,639
system looks like

381
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,638
as a function of time

382
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:23,680
so as an example we have a simple.jaws

383
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:26,560
algorithm implemented

384
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:28,000
on our tutorial page so tutorials in the

385
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:30,319
form of jupyter notebook

386
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,279
you can look at that you can read the

387
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,519
instruction

388
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:34,959
and also run the code by itself at the

389
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:37,600
same time

390
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:39,760
so where we have a very simple digital

391
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:42,839
circuit here of three qubits

392
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:44,000
and we find the control pause of this

393
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:47,279
algorithm is

394
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,760
one called spin chain model

395
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:51,120
so each color here in this figure

396
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:53,040
represents a different control

397
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,000
hamiltonian basically different control

398
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:56,639
pulse

399
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,279
and those controls will realize this

400
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:01,120
circuit

401
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:03,279
so those higher powers is for s naught

402
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,639
and these those one are for the c note

403
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:06,880
gate

404
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:07,760
so in the in the notebook you can find

405
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:10,320
that we

406
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:11,600
run the circuit and compare the results

407
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:14,720
these and without

408
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,720
some additional noise

409
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:22,000
the summary so this new module

410
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:23,360
in this new module we produce a

411
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,199
structured framework

412
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,480
that can help you to simulate your

413
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:28,639
quantum device

414
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,600
so we offer this pulse level control

415
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:32,800
interface

416
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:35,360
and with this noise with this

417
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:37,439
way of defining noise you can actually

418
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:40,480
simulate your device in a more

419
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:43,040
way closer to physics

420
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,160
so we will transfer the gate into the

421
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:47,839
control pulse

422
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:50,319
also in noise to it with the help of

423
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:51,519
back-end and compiler you can actually

424
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:56,800
set up your device

425
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:56,800
the simulator of a a few lines of code

426
00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:03,439
so there's a lot of potential

427
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,360
use cases for this so for example

428
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:08,000
because we are now running running a

429
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:09,440
simulation you can actually turn on turn

430
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,759
off noise

431
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:14,160
means that i can compare the influence

432
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:15,279
of different kind of noise

433
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,839
so in this way you can actually

434
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:18,639
determine or at least study get an

435
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:20,639
intuition

436
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:23,600
what is actually the dominant noise in

437
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:26,320
my system

438
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,199
um if you are like the designer quantum

439
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,959
algorithm

440
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:31,359
you can also give your quantum algorithm

441
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:33,040
as an input to our system

442
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,959
and then you see that you can see that

443
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:38,319
how does the algorithm perform

444
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:38,959
a certain kind of device or how or is my

445
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:42,639
algorithm

446
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:45,040
sensitive to some certain kind of noise

447
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:45,839
so addition you can also use it to for

448
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:48,399
example test

449
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:49,120
some noise mitigation scheme so there's

450
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:51,759
a risk

451
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,320
there's a paper from ibm where they use

452
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:55,440
this

453
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:58,560
extrapolation to mitigate noise

454
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,600
basically what they do is that they have

455
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:02,079
a parameter

456
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:04,400
that characterize the strength of noise

457
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:06,000
and they run their device rear physical

458
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:09,120
device

459
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:12,799
for different noise strengths and they

460
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:15,599
extrapolate back to find okay what

461
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:17,039
does the result looks like if i have no

462
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:19,280
noise

463
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:20,879
so because the argument is basically at

464
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:24,000
the level of hamiltonian

465
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:26,000
and this module will be useful to for

466
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,839
example verification their results

467
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,839
or maybe even do some improvement

468
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,760
now with this i'll go to the end of my

469
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:35,370
talk

470
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:37,039
so those are the

471
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:39,918
[Music]

472
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:41,600
developers for q-tip so because q-tip is

473
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:44,240
actually already

474
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:46,480
eight or nine-year-old there has been

475
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:49,280
different generations of developers

476
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,960
so those two are the original developer

477
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:53,678
in from japan

478
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:55,600
and so they have nice paper published so

479
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:58,720
if you are using qtip for your research

480
00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:01,520
please tell society and those are the

481
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:03,360
current lead developers you can see that

482
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,918
we have people from basically all around

483
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:07,760
the world

484
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:09,520
from europe from canada from japan

485
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:11,840
and we also have dozens of other

486
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:16,559
contributors who

487
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:16,559
contribute to the qtp project

488
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:21,600
so if you're interested in this project

489
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:23,760
or in general in q-tip

490

and let it become part of q-tip

510
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:10,240
so another way another very nice way of

511
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:12,320
contributing and become the one of the

512
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:14,799
one of the community is through the

513
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:17,039
google summer of code

514
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:18,799
so this year we are participating again

515
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:22,640
in google summer code

516
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:23,280
so between may and august so if you are

517
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,679
about to

518
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:28,080
graduate in a few months or you are

519
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:31,360
going to have a very long holiday

520
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:33,918
you can it's a very nice way to

521
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:34,799
join the team so you can find a few

522
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:37,440
projects

523
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:38,480
proposed on this page a few more is to

524
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,480
come

525
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,760
and you are also very welcome to bring

526
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:44,559
our own project

527
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:46,960
so what do you want to do with q-tip or

528
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:50,000
what you want to add to q-tip

529
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:52,720
so because i am a student of last year

530
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:55,360
i very highly recommend it if you are

531
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:58,799
interested in open source vm

532
00:19:55,360 --> 00:20:02,240
development uh so even if you have

533
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:04,158
zero experience you it's it's also okay

534
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:05,280
because you are going to be mentored by

535
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:09,039
the

536
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:11,918
qt members both from the coding side and

537
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:13,039
from the physics side so and also google

538
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:17,200
will give you a

539
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:20,480
scholarship for a few months for support

540
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:23,520
and so this is my blog of last year

541
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:25,039
so i where i wrote some of my some of

542
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,879
our ideas and what

543
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:28,960
the problem we're trying to solve and

544
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:32,640
also some of kind of were

545
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:35,200
a method we used and at the very end

546
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:36,799
a small advertisement for myself so i'm

547
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,000
a master student that is about to

548
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:41,520
graduate this summer

549
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:43,679
i'm looking for phd positions so if

550
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:45,120
any of you have some nice project and

551
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:48,400
find my background might be

552
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:49,840
helpful please contact me okay uh

553
00:20:48,400 --> 00:21:03,840
with this i'll thank you for your

554
00:20:49,840 --> 00:21:03,840
attention thank you very much

555
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:16,960
uh hi what format are the control pulses

556
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:19,600
emitted in the back end of q-tip

557
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,960
is it like splines frequency domain time

558
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:25,199
domain

559
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:27,200
sorry the control pulses that the beckon

560
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:29,200
emits that are device specific

561
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,240
what's the format or how are they

562
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:33,679
represented

563
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:35,120
is it like uh like splines or frequency

564
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:38,159
domain or

565
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:39,760
uh it's it's it's basically just uh as a

566
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:41,840
figure i showed before the control

567
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:45,120
hamiltonian from so we don't have

568
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:47,280
we don't yet have like a

569
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:48,399
back end for iron trap design yet it's

570
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:51,360
their development

571
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:53,360
but basically what we consist of is the

572
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:56,559
hamiltonian corresponding hamiltonian

573
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:59,520
the target pulse and that will define

574
00:21:56,559 --> 00:22:02,240
characterize your device device okay

575
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,240
cool thank you yeah

576
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:10,080
okay so you were talking about the

577
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:13,199
different noises

578
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:14,080
what happens if in your gate if you have

579
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:17,200
some

580
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:18,080
structure defect or surface defect did

581
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:22,240
you do such

582
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:24,559
study like will it modify or distort

583
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:27,039
your output pulse

584
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:28,320
um it basically determines so this part

585
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:31,520
will come into the

586
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:32,240
back end so now we only have backhand

587
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:35,440
for some

588
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:36,320
a very limited range of devices and i

589
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:40,720
think

590
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:42,960
um the the those like defects you

591
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,600
mentioned will be very small part like

592
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,799
in the

593
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:48,480
device and can be maybe modified how the

594
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:50,720
evolution is running backend

595
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:52,159
you can do that but it will depends very

596
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:55,840
highly on what kind of

597
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:55,840
system it is right

598
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:03,520
okay we got time for one more

599
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:05,679
um i was wondering this solving of a

600
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:07,679
differential equation is this just

601
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:08,960
cutting it up a very time small small

602
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:10,559
time steps and just running through

603
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:12,880
there's something more clever happening

604
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:14,639
there are different approaches so there

605
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:17,039
is a

606
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:18,799
differential equation approach you use

607
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:19,520
something similar to learning kuta not

608
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:22,400
exactly

609
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:22,960
and solve it and there's also montcallo

610
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:26,720
approach

611
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:28,799
so you basically

612
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:30,320
build different sample sound of

613
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:31,679
approaches with different kind of

614
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:34,399
collapse operator

615
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:35,200
lint blood operator and then you take

616
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:38,640
the average

617
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:40,720
of different month color trays

618
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:44,159
that's a that's that's a typical way to

619
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:46,799
do this like in quantum optics and this

620
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:46,799
field yeah

621
00:23:47,840 --> 00:24:05,678
okay so let's thank boxy one more time
