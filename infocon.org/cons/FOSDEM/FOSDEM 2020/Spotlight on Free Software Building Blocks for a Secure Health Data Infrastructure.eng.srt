1
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:22,160
okay so we are right on time

2
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:23,680
and thank you for organizing this track

3
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,920
thank you for the opportunity to speak

4
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:27,759
to you

5
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,160
this is marcel my name is marcos we are

6
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:32,800
both research associates at the

7
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:35,840
department of medical informatics

8
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:37,919
in the city of gottingen in germany and

9
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:42,840
now we switch from the neurosciences

10
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:46,079
domain to the medical research domain

11
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:48,480
and our plan is to give you a quick

12
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,320
very quick overview of some of the tools

13
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,959
that we

14
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,320
use in our domain of research and just

15
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,960
to get an overview

16
00:00:54,320 --> 00:01:00,160
who has ever been in contact with the

17
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:02,239
domain of medical informatics

18
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:04,479
quite a few well well it's overwhelming

19
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:06,560
actually

20
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:08,240
so you might recognize some of the tools

21
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,960
but for all the others

22
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:12,560
we try to introduce a little bit the

23
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:16,559
discipline in general

24
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:19,280
so we thought of how to

25
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,240
how to characterize our domain and we

26
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,880
set those like

27
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:24,080
four major fields of research in medical

28
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:27,439
informatics

29
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:28,640
so at the core of it there's systems for

30
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:31,119
primary care

31
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,479
so um i think everybody can relate to

32
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:33,680
that when you are sick when you go to

33
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:37,360
the hospital

34
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:41,119
um you your case creates data

35
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:43,119
your your condition is documented

36
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:45,119
and all of this is done in electronic

37
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:48,560
health record systems

38
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:51,040
um maybe there are images taken mri ct

39
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,560
echocardiography those are put into some

40
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:55,360
information systems

41
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,159
and all of this is a primary care domain

42
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,479
and then

43
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:01,040
we have a couple of research domains or

44
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:03,520
we should research heavy domains

45
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:05,119
first of all biomedical research where

46
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,679
you study the

47
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:08,639
systems biology within the body and

48
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,000
derive

49
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:15,519
therapy ideas the other

50
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,520
route would be to go down here into take

51
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:20,800
routine data

52
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:23,840
run statistics on them and do

53
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,319
use so it's called secondary use because

54
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,360
uh

55
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:30,480
you again data that was collected

56
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:33,120
in primary care is used for research to

57
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:35,359
develop new therapy options again

58
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,200
and finally because we run something

59
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,280
called evidence-based medicine we want

60
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,920
statistical scientific evidence that the

61
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,640
therapies

62
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:44,000
run in primary care are actually not

63
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:46,238
harmful and even

64
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,840
beneficial for your condition so all of

65
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:50,800
this goes up to the top

66
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,599
into what's called clinical trials so

67
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,720
basically

68
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:55,359
you do experiments in human to make sure

69
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,239
that

70
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:00,560
everything we do in therapy is actually

71
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:00,560
sound

72
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,879
we will go through a couple of software

73
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:08,560
tools that

74
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:10,079
are part of some of those fields

75
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,239
and one thing i would like to mention is

76
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,879
that the primary care

77
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:16,319
is basically the probably the domain

78
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:20,399
with the least

79
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:22,319
open source software which is due to the

80
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,599
regulations that are in place in primary

81
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:25,679
care i mean it is

82
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:26,959
you're treating patients which means

83
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,879
that even software will

84
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:34,560
soon have to comply to european medical

85
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:38,159
device regulations and so on so

86
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,920
many companies create proprietary

87
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:42,959
software and sell it

88
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:44,839
because they say our software complies

89
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:47,040
with all the

90
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:49,680
regulation so to take you to the

91
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:52,720
software tools that we want to introduce

92
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:55,920
a short story

93
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:57,920
this is bob bob suffers from chronic

94
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,238
heart insufficiency so this means that

95
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:01,359
bob

96
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:01,920
regularly has to visit the hospital have

97
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:05,519
his

98
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:07,119
condition checked up every time he has

99
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:10,879
to go in for routine checkup

100
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:13,920
they document the medication he's on

101
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:14,959
they take blood samples and also they

102
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:18,560
make echo

103
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:20,399
cardiographic imaging and

104
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,240
all of this is stored in the clinical

105
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:24,400
information systems

106
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,160
so this is a model hospital because they

107
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,159
actually use an open source tool for

108
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:31,520
primary care documentation

109
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:34,000
in this case they news use exnut

110
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:35,440
which is a picture archiving and

111
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,199
documentation system

112
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:42,719
that is open source and

113
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:44,800
that can store the images created and

114
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,000
the the structured data that is derived

115
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,360
from those images

116
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,400
so the vital parameters that are

117
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:56,080
actually interesting in further

118
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:58,880
research on the data xnet is a

119
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:00,719
very extensible open source tool you can

120
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,919
not only store the images and share them

121
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:05,120
with your colleagues

122
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:05,919
you can also plug in analysis pipelines

123
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,199
like image

124
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:11,680
image j to run analysis on the

125
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:12,960
on the images and data that is stored in

126
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,840
there

127
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:17,758
and yeah in the end it gives you

128
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:20,159
web-based user interfaces for image

129
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:23,199
upload

130
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:25,919
also image viewers etc

131
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:27,759
so uh since bob is also not only at the

132
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:29,359
model hospital but he's a model patient

133
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:33,039
he has given content for

134
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:34,720
uh that his his medical data may be used

135
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:38,800
for research purposes

136
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:42,639
um just like that

137
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:46,400
and this leads us to of course alice

138
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:48,560
and alice is a health data engineer

139
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,919
at a place called the medical data

140
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:53,440
integration center

141
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:57,039
so that's basically where we work

142
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:58,479
and her job is to get all the data that

143
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:00,719
is created

144
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:02,080
and documented in primary care systems

145
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:05,360
out of those systems so we

146
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:06,318
extract this data to mask patient

147
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,960
identity because

148
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:10,479
in clinical systems you always have the

149
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,159
medical data stored

150
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:13,680
for each patient and you know who this

151
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,360
patient is in research

152
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,319
we do not want to know who the patient

153
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:21,520
is so we want to anonymize the data

154
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:23,280
so the data has to be masked then the

155
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,799
data has to be transformed

156
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:27,198
according to the formats that you can

157
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,960
use in in research

158
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:30,880
and finally put into some kind of

159
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,840
research data repository

160
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:35,360
to make it accessible again for

161
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:38,080
researchers

162
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,479
the tool that alice uses is open source

163
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,080
and

164
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:44,080
it's talent open studio for data

165
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:46,800
integration so this is a

166
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:47,359
graphical user interface data workflow

167
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,759
manager

168
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,560
i'll give you a little bit better image

169
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:53,440
of that

170
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,319
so you can create a data transformation

171
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,560
workflows

172
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:57,919
with a graphical user interface it's

173
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:01,759
based on eclipse

174
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:03,919
it's also provided as a product by a

175
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:05,599
company but

176
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:08,000
all in all it's open source tool and you

177
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:11,280
can create these kind of workflows

178
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,520
uh dragging and dropping like sub

179
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:16,400
processes that are encapsulated and can

180
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:18,639
be reused in different workflows

181
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,638
you can export all of that as a as a jar

182
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:23,199
file and then run it on servers

183
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,880
and orchestrate this and this is

184
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:26,479
basically what we do to

185
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,319
extract data from all the different

186
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:29,199
clinical information systems and put it

187
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:32,639
into a single

188
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:36,319
research repository in the end so sub

189
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:39,919
uh processes part of these etl jobs

190
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:42,840
run through talent is for

191
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:44,000
for one the masking of the patient

192
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,679
identity

193
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,120
the example two we use for that is the

194
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:50,240
mindset lister

195
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:53,520
it's a german german name for

196
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:55,440
two mostly created in germany so please

197
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:57,280
excuse me that these slides are in

198
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:59,599
german it just says that we

199
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:01,758
pseudonymize the identifying data of a

200
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:04,240
patient so you see the name on the

201
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:04,960
uh on the left actually and then you

202
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,280
sodium

203
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,799
pseudonymize it you just get some random

204
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:11,919
id number back

205
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:13,440
and you can also use this service this

206
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:16,400
masking service to

207
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:18,400
create different different secondary ids

208
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:22,799
that belong to this first id

209
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:23,440
so yeah there's lots of math behind that

210
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:28,240
and you can

211
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:31,520
actually do lots of stuff so you can do

212
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,919
a de-identified record linkage so you

213
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,279
have

214
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:37,838
research data from two different systems

215
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:39,519
that have separate ids you do not know

216
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:41,279
that those are the same data from the

217
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,159
same patient but you can use the service

218
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:45,839
to

219
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:45,839
link those data back again in the end

220
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:52,399
yeah so each of those de-identified data

221
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:54,480
packages that we now created in the

222
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:56,640
first step of our workflow

223
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,000
has to be stored and we are working in

224
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:01,120
science we want to have

225
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:04,080
all the all the data pieces we use in

226
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,880
in the scientific progress uh archived

227
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,839
and stored

228
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:10,560
persistently for this we use an open

229
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:14,160
source tool called cdstar

230
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:17,839
this is developed in gottingen it's a

231
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:21,120
data storage middleware basically

232
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:24,240
so we mask all the

233
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,800
underlying block storage options or that

234
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,519
are when

235
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:28,240
running the data center we put a rest

236
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:30,560
api

237
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:33,279
in front of it and we can just use rest

238
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:36,399
calls to store data items

239
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:38,399
together with access control lists and

240
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:40,000
metadata about this item

241
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:42,160
and we also generate persistent

242
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,040
identifiers so that each data package

243
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:46,560
that was used

244
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:49,839
in one of those processes can be

245
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:51,599
identified afterwards permanently

246
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:53,760
hopefully forever because we use data

247
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,600
center that's in the forever business

248
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:59,439
because they are linked to our

249
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,440
library university library

250
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,839
so this is the q2 switch

251
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:32,000
so awkwardly switching has been done i

252
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,800
hope the cartoon was long enough to

253
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,800
distract all of you

254
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:38,880
so we've seen that alice has started

255
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:41,360
data in cd star

256
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:43,279
and now uh she has this data in some

257
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,640
format she maybe thought of but we would

258
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:46,800
like to have more we would like to have

259
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:48,880
semantic annotation meaning that

260
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,000
the data file itself should contain

261
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,399
something that tells

262
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,640
some other person what the data is about

263
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:55,279
so you may know it from csv files with

264
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,279
just

265
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:58,720
data tables where you don't know what it

266
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:00,720
means and

267
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:03,279
best most of the time uh table header

268
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:05,360
that says some weird combination of

269
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:06,399
letters that you don't understand so in

270
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:09,680
order to circumvent

271
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:11,600
circumvent that we use open ehr open ehr

272
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:13,359
actually is a foundation so it creates a

273
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,560
lot of stuff but the two things we want

274
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:17,120
to focus on

275
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:20,160
uh would be the specification as well as

276
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:22,399
the clinical modeling part of openehr

277
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,199
so as for the specification the guys at

278
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:26,320
openhr

279
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:28,720
created a two level modeling

280
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,920
yeah architecture where the

281
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,079
specification states

282
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:33,040
different reference models um these are

283
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:34,800
the most basic

284
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,160
parts that you can store data in so

285
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,000
think about that as

286
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:39,680
data types in every programming language

287
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,640
like character or integer or something

288
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,560
like that

289
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:44,720
using this reference model you can go a

290
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:46,000
level higher and use it in the let's say

291
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,839
user space

292
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,680
where different users with clinical

293
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:52,320
knowledge can take these reference

294
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:54,399
model uh piece of information and put

295
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,320
them together into an archetype

296
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:58,240
an archetype would be a let's say

297
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:01,600
logical um

298
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:04,000
yeah logical uh compounded uh um

299
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,800
value that you can store in a database

300
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,120
afterwards

301
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:08,319
so meaning that instead of just storing

302
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,160
a number you want to have the blood

303
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,320
pressure you need two numbers and maybe

304
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:14,240
some other units or something like that

305
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,800
so an archetype would for example be

306
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,279
bob's

307
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:19,359
blood pressure at the topmost level the

308
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:20,000
templates are even a higher level

309
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,079
collection

310
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,880
of archetypes meaning that you can model

311
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:26,959
even higher level uh constructs like a

312
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,360
visit so meaning that a patient comes to

313
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:30,399
a

314
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:32,639
hospital you're able to create how

315
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:34,240
should a visit look like what archetypes

316
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:37,279
what what parameters

317
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,639
has to has a study nurse to record in

318
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:41,600
order to

319
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:43,279
map everything to a common data format

320
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,360
if you do that a template may look like

321
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:45,920
that so pretty complex pretty big and

322
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,760
it's

323
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:49,599
more or less really hard to just look at

324
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,160
the data itself so imagine that will be

325
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,560
a

326
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:53,839
really big json xml file it's hard to

327
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,680
find the data in that

328
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,959
so obviously the guys of open ehr

329
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,638
thought of that and created the

330
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:00,880
archetype query language

331
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:02,720
which is a kind of hybrid between sql

332
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,399
and xpath that allows you to traverse

333
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:06,639
the hierarchical data

334
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:08,079
and get your data that you want to have

335
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:10,000
out of that

336
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:12,239
so very nice we have now the data in a

337
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,160
common format that can be understood by

338
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,920
other people so let's introduce another

339
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:19,120
researcher called carmen

340
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,599
and she wants to get the data she uh no

341
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,360
she

342
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:24,000
first of all she does research on heart

343
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:26,320
and suffix heart insufficiency

344
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,079
so just the condition that bob has and

345
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,560
she now wants to have some data from the

346
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:31,519
open

347
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:32,800
ehr repository so so if she's capable of

348
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:35,279
doing that

349
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:36,639
she will specify some coin some kind of

350
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:38,880
aql query

351
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:41,040
get the data out of the database that is

352
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:43,439
uh set up at the hospital

353
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:45,599
and is then able to use another platform

354
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:49,120
or another tool to analyze the data that

355
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:51,760
uh is called i2b2 transmit again

356
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,399
i2b2 transmit actually are two tools but

357
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:55,040
they are

358
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:57,360
being merged right now together and this

359
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:58,639
tool is a data a clinical data warehouse

360
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,880
that allows to

361
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:02,800
do some simple analytics and analytics

362
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,240
on data

363
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,680
we will focus on transmog for this

364
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:07,279
presentation because it's the tool that

365
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:09,120
we run at the moment but in

366
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:10,399
due time we will switch to the iqb to

367
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:13,600
transmit merged

368
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:15,440
tool for that you can see

369
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,959
in this picture you can see how this can

370
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,880
look like so you can

371
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:20,479
look at very basic statistics like the

372
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:23,680
distribution of the age

373
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:26,000
or the gender distribution

374
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:27,279
so to kind to get a feel for your data

375
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,199
that you have

376
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:31,279
and you can even run more sophisticated

377
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:33,680
analysis using our scripts you can just

378
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:36,000
create an r script write it upload it

379
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:38,479
there and the analytics engine will

380
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,079
give you the output that you desired uh

381
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:43,279
the two

382
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:44,800
we use this tool primarily to kind of do

383
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:47,120
a data review

384
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,000
so in this example you can see that

385
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:51,440
there is a

386
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,040
correlation between age and height

387
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,800
and you can see that there is a lot of

388
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:56,560
data points on the left but only one at

389
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,040
the right this is because the person

390
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,760
that is

391
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:01,920
depicted there has a height of 165

392
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:04,880
meters which is let's say unlikely

393
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,599
but it just shows that um data that you

394
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,519
integrate

395
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,199
from the heterogeneous it

396
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:10,800
infrastructures usually are

397
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:13,680
erroneous and you have to think about

398
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:17,040
that and you have to keep that in mind

399
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:20,079
um okay so let's let's say she uh

400
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:22,399
had a had a a research hypothesis

401
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:23,279
uh common that specified that did her

402
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:26,079
research and

403
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:27,199
was able to either approve or reject the

404
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:29,199
hypothesis

405
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:31,040
she writes up a paper and everything is

406
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:33,519
nice everything is clean

407
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:35,360
and she submitted this submits this

408
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:37,360
paper to an open access journal

409
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:39,279
what we'd like to see is that she opens

410
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:41,920
up her data as well so in the spirit of

411
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:43,600
open research open data she showed

412
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:45,839
yeah publish the data somewhere she

413
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,680
could do that in a phantom seek instance

414
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:49,199
located at the hospital run at the

415
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:51,680
hospital

416
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:53,040
fedomseq is basically a data repository

417
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,719
which follows the ic

418
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:57,360
isa standard which stands for

419
00:15:54,720 --> 00:16:01,440
investigation study and

420
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:04,560
assess essay thank you

421
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:06,959
and most importantly it

422
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:08,239
stores rich metadata with the data files

423
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:10,800
that you can upload there

424
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,839
so you can assign a license you can say

425
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,519
this data p

426
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:16,240
this piece of data was conducted in this

427
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:18,560
study using this investigation and so on

428
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,759
and with that you can much better

429
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:22,638
publish the data

430
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:24,480
and uh yeah stored persistently so even

431
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:26,959
after several years

432
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:28,800
you can provide the same link you can

433
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:29,680
call that link and you can see okay this

434
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:32,880
data was

435
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:34,399
used in this publication and i can maybe

436
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:36,880
open up this publication to find more

437
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:39,759
about the data or vice versa

438
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:41,120
so yeah thanks to all the tools and the

439
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:43,279
people that are involved and that were

440
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:45,440
able to use these tools

441
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:47,360
maybe bob can get healthy and all his

442
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:50,639
fellow patients

443
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:52,240
can lead longer and happier lives so for

444
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:53,839
one hospital this may

445
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,920
may even be somewhere the case i don't

446
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:58,399
know not in germany more certainly

447
00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:00,479
but um what about sharing data with

448
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:01,839
other hospitals

449
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,400
this is something that is very hard to

450
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:06,079
do for us especially we're working on

451
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,600
that project right now and we can see

452
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:08,639
that there is a lot of data

453
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:11,359
infrastructure

454
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,400
on the global level that uh tries to do

455
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:14,240
that to link

456
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,919
data together so create this internet of

457
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:18,880
data objects

458
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:20,000
um there is a lot of work put into that

459
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:22,720
in different domains

460
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,079
um and for example in the medical

461
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,439
informatics domain

462
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:27,760
uh on the national scale we have the

463
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:30,400
medical informatics initiative which uh

464
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,879
yeah has offered us some money basically

465
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,960
to

466
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:35,200
build this up for germany on the

467
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,799
international scale odyssey or eden

468
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,240
do basically the same with other data

469
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:39,679
formats other technologies but have the

470
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:41,200
same goals so

471
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:42,880
it's a very very good movement to see

472
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,760
that that they want to link the data

473
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,840
together

474
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:47,600
and across domain there are also

475
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,159
developments that most of you people may

476
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,799
know

477
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,520
like the research data alliance or the

478
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:54,799
working group

479
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:57,600
from the w3c data on the web which has

480
00:17:54,799 --> 00:18:00,080
specified the doap protocol to

481
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:01,360
access digital objects from different

482
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:04,080
domains or from different it

483
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,080
infrastructures

484
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:08,640
so in order to create in order to to use

485
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:10,960
this data over

486
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:12,320
uh the boundaries of our hospital we

487
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,840
have to think

488
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:15,439
especially in medicine about the

489
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:18,159
security um

490
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:19,280
since medical data is very sensitive um

491
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,440
as we said we

492
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:23,678
we are doing a masking of the patient

493
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,160
data but still this may be not enough if

494
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:27,919
you think

495
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:28,720
of rare diseases it's very likely that a

496
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:31,360
doctor that

497
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,000
knows a lot of rare diseases or works in

498
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,479
the fields

499
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,240
is able to find a specific combination

500
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,720
of some diseases and no okay i know this

501
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:40,400
patient

502
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:43,120
i've seen that before because it's rare

503
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:44,559
so this medical data bears both high

504
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:47,760
value for the research

505
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:50,559
but also potential for misuse so

506
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:52,160
uh we think that the benefit from linked

507
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:54,480
medical data has to be

508
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:56,080
uh exploited basically so we we want to

509
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,600
have the data we don't want to have it

510
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:59,360
accessible

511
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:02,240
and do research on that to improve

512
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:03,840
healthcare but what we need to do

513
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,280
would be to create secure i.t

514
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,080
infrastructures for that so not

515
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,918
everybody should

516
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:09,600
be able to just like that download

517
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:11,679
everything and have it in a

518
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,879
really big nice repository and do some i

519
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:13,840
don't know big data analytics or

520
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,080
something like that

521
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:17,678
as he wishes but we do need some

522
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:19,520
regulation and do need some yes

523
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:22,000
safeguards in place

524
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:24,720
um and for the to do so we need

525
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,480
accountable and transparent workflows so

526
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:28,640
not only we have to make it secure but

527
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,200
the patient should know where is my data

528
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,200
going

529
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,960
what is happening with my data where is

530
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:35,039
research may be published for

531
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:36,480
with my data in order to empower the

532
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:38,720
patient um

533
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,919
yeah scandals like the the cambridge

534
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:42,480
analytica

535
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:43,360
uh data leak or the legal what they did

536
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,360
with the data

537
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:47,199
doesn't really make it particularly easy

538
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,320
to say go up to a patient and say hey

539
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,120
can we have your data we want to do

540
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,760
research so

541
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:52,559
they're pretty hesitant on that um this

542
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:55,440
also not all

543
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:57,120
this this not only all this this not

544
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:59,919
only counts for the data

545
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:01,280
but obviously for the for the um for the

546
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:04,159
for the tools that we use

547
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:06,000
themselves so uh we try to use tools

548
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:07,840
that are off the shelf are available for

549
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,679
download but not every tool fits our

550
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:11,280
purpose so we have someone

551
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:13,280
some sometimes to extend it or even

552
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:15,840
build new tools and

553
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:17,200
from our perspective this has to be uh

554
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:20,320
open source tools because

555
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:23,600
um this is the only way to really

556
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:24,320
uh show get transparency and empower the

557
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,719
patient

558
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:28,080
so things like public domain public

559
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,440
money public code

560
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:31,600
show that we're going in the right

561
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:34,240
direction and have a political

562
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:35,120
let's say a layer to talk about these

563
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:38,240
things

564
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:39,840
so we need that for medical

565
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,840
research especially and we should

566
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:43,280
emphasize that everyone

567
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:45,120
who's working in this medical field

568
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,480
should think about that that making not

569
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:48,479
only the data open

570
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:50,720
just as is but thinking about the tools

571
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:54,240
that you are using and making these open

572
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:55,679
and the data flows you're creating so

573
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,440
global data infrastructure we saw them

574
00:20:55,679 --> 00:21:00,640
they are being built um

575
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:02,000
and we should uh establish decentralized

576
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:06,240
and free technologies

577
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:07,840
to ensure secure it it infrastructures

578
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:09,440
typically the medical information

579
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:11,199
systems are really not

580
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:13,280
free or open source whatsoever these are

581
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,080
proprietary big blocks that we saw that

582
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:17,520
are very black

583
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:18,960
and nobody touches them um but the tools

584
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:21,918
in medical informatics research are

585
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:24,960
frequently used and could be very well

586
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:26,720
rolled out to more of the primary care

587
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,080
but we have to advance that we have to

588
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:30,159
uh politically uh

589
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:32,240
like make voice for that and say hey

590
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:36,320
there are tools you could use

591
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:38,240
and yeah please do so if you are capable

592
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:39,520
so we saw that uh some people from the

593
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,280
medical school mania

594
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:43,440
raise your voice it would be really a

595
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:45,840
step forward to have more openness in

596
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:48,880
the medical informatics research

597
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:50,320
um so for the references uh obviously

598
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:52,320
thanks for the team in gutting and

599
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:53,918
we had a lot of guys that are very open

600
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:57,678
to the whole open source

601
00:21:53,919 --> 00:22:01,120
community and we try to uh yeah

602
00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:02,640
advise it on further use and

603
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:04,239
like like everyone basically said if

604
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,720
you're interested contact us we have

605
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:13,840
jobs

606
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:13,840
yeah so thank you very much

607
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:24,799
questions doesn't work if i turn off the

608
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,799
microphone so any questions

609
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:31,919
yes actually i don't find that

610
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:34,960
the software is

611
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:38,240
appropriate and

612
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:41,360
i find that for example this format

613
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:44,320
of medical

614
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:46,240
research should be opened you know

615
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:48,559
exchange format should be

616
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,559
should be

617
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:55,840
unified somehow

618
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:14,000
which triggers the person

619
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:17,760
or let's say helps the doctor

620
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:20,720
to treat it with some

621
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:22,400
kind of algorithm so so the first

622
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:24,640
comment was that we

623
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:26,480
do not necessarily need open resource

624
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:28,080
tools or research tools but

625
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:29,600
especially open formats and open

626
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:31,199
standards right so like

627
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:33,120
open ehr representative there are a lot

628
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:36,320
of other standards fire

629
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:37,039
ombcdm i we agree totally so we we do

630
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:39,120
need that to

631
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:40,080
exchange data and enrich it semantically

632
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:43,199
so other can

633
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:45,760
reuse the uh the same data um

634
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,480
the second comment was uh what the

635
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:50,000
question was

636
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:52,159
um where is our field of application

637
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,720
right where where we where we going that

638
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:56,720
so basically as medical informaticists

639
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,039
uh we're kind of in between everything

640
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,520
so

641
00:23:57,039 --> 00:24:01,679
basically we're trying to help the

642
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:03,840
researchers get the data analyze it and

643
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:06,799
and derive research hypothesis from it

644
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:08,080
we're trying to get to the patient to to

645
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:10,240
to empower

646
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:11,520
his view on his data and we're also

647
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,960
trying to

648
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:15,360
go a little bit into primary care and

649
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:16,240
say hey look at that we have this tools

650
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,799
we use

651
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:20,000
this path to get the data from a to b

652
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:24,799
and wouldn't it be

653
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,799
a a possibility for you guys in the it

654
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:29,120
yes you talked about sharing data

655
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:31,440
between

656
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:32,959
medical institutions as well as like a

657
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:35,120
political movement to get this

658
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,840
underway which happens to be exactly

659
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,360
what we're trying to do in the

660
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:39,760
netherlands so my question is how can we

661
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:43,039
get in touch

662
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:44,559
uh okay the the question was um

663
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:46,400
there are similar movements in the

664
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:48,158
netherlands right now so basically what

665
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,679
we shouted out we want to have the doing

666
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:52,240
that in netherlands so great

667
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:53,679
um please come to us after the talk we

668
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:56,799
would like to talk i guess

669
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:58,480
um and i i hope i think i don't know

670
00:24:56,799 --> 00:25:00,000
which project you are associated with

671
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:02,720
there are some projects that do that

672
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,559
internationally but i agree there's not

673
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,360
much communication so everybody gets

674
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:06,639
this grant and

675
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:08,879
tries to build up something open

676
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:10,400
sourcing and then we have 60

677
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,919
different versions of open source

678
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:15,360
standards which comply

679
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:18,720
very very badly yeah so i guess yeah

680
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:28,320
the answer is let's talk we have to talk

681
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:31,120
yeah sure

682
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:32,399
you are in one consortium but um is

683
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:34,080
there a lot of dialogue with the other

684
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,600
consortium because i get the impression

685
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,799
they are also developing different

686
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,719
versions

687
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:40,639
to do this um is there a lot of

688
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:42,400
discussion on using their people's tools

689
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:45,120
there as

690
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:46,559
so so your question was regarding the uh

691
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:48,799
medical information

692
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:51,120
informatics initiative in germany and

693
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:52,000
how the four consortia that are being um

694
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:55,439
um

695
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:57,760
funded their act together so

696
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,720
yes especially relating to the open

697
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:01,600
source tools

698
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:02,480
so uh we have uh like yeah organization

699
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,639
that goes

700
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:06,960
above all of it and tries to increase

701
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:08,080
the communication between

702
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:09,840
but of course these are these are

703
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,960
professors talking about problems that

704
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:12,720
have to be solved

705
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:14,159
um on a working level we try to

706
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:15,919
establish those

707
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:17,840
i mean in germany it's not a huge

708
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:20,080
community so basically everyone knows

709
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:22,080
everyone some how and we have meetups

710
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:24,559
and so things like that so

711
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,678
um we have to increase uh the the

712
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:29,360
talking bit in between

713
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:32,240
we try to do so and we have we tried to

714
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:33,520
establish well let's say the standard

715
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:36,320
for for open source

716
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:38,000
is set i i i've never seen a researcher

717
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:39,039
in medical informatics who says now open

718
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,000
source we don't need that

719
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:42,960
everyone is the same but what we have to

720
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,200
do is to

721
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:46,640
deliver that more into primary care and

722
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:48,240
to the people that are not

723
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:50,080
affiliated with medical informatics

724
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:52,640
itself but maybe more in the

725
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:53,760
medical i.t which are somewhat more

726
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:56,480
hesitant

727
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:56,480
regarding that

728
00:26:56,799 --> 00:27:00,559
now you can speak with your speakers

729
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:07,840
afterwards

730
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:10,879
you
