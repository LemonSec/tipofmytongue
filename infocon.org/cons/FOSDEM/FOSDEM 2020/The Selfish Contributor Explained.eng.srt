1
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:08,639
um

2
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:09,760
so good morning everyone um our next

3
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:12,879
speaker is mr

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:16,560
james bottomley with his talk

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:19,090
titled the selfish contributor explained

6
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:23,840
well thank you very much indeed and

7
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:26,480
[Applause]

8
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,240
so if you attended the previous talk

9
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,560
denise took us through a nice

10
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:32,238
view of the airy hopeful altruistic

11
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,920
uplands of open source and what it can

12
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:35,760
do for municipalities

13
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,200
i'm going to take you on a journey

14
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,519
through the deep dark

15
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,360
motivational secrets to see me

16
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,840
underbelly of open source

17
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:45,440
how people can actually get engineers to

18
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,719
contribute efficiently to the open

19
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:49,120
source project

20
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:52,000
um i'm james bottomley i work for ibm as

21
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:53,839
you can see from my email address

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,600
i am actually a very old school open

23
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:58,480
source person so my open source

24
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:00,719
experience actually goes back to 1982

25
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:03,038
with looking at the source code of what

26
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:05,760
was then bsd

27
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:06,080
so that means i've spent almost 40 years

28
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,680
in

29
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:11,679
open source and as a result although

30
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,680
my marketing department in ibm makes me

31
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,600
put my twitter account on the slides

32
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,880
twitter for me is mostly a write-only

33
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,559
exercise so

34
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:21,679
if you expect to contact me that way

35
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:24,720
you're going to be sorely disappointed

36
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:26,159
so i've been a container evangelist for

37
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:30,000
a long time in fact

38
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:31,600
nearly um 10 years now so containers are

39
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,079
usually my thing and i have actually

40
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,360
talked

41
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:36,960
at fosdem about containers before

42
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,960
i have actually spent a lot of time in

43
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,679
open source advocacy in the very early

44
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,279
days

45
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,439
so i was one of the people who was

46
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,000
instrumental in actually

47
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:47,758
trying to capture what was then the open

48
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,680
source development laboratory that was

49
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:51,280
trying to co-op the linux kernel into

50
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,119
doing projects it didn't want

51
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,960
and actually make it serve the open

52
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:58,320
source community so that's where i got

53
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:00,158
my first taste of open source politics

54
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,000
and of course i'm still technically a

55
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:04,159
kernel developer of course

56
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,920
i'm now so old that nobody really

57
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:06,719
expects me to write that much useful

58
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,598
code

59
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:10,478
so i have uh sub maintainers martin

60
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:12,640
peterson

61
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:14,319
abele looks after the skizzy subsystem

62
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,319
and helga della looks after the peer

63
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:18,079
risk architecture i do virtually nothing

64
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:20,000
i think the last few patches i did for

65
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,000
scuzzy were just some bug fixers

66
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,440
admittedly for pa risk this year i did

67
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,920
actually make the bootloader work on

68
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:29,040
ext4 so i'm still coding there

69
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,319
but the point is that uh martin just

70
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:33,040
doesn't really want to deal with the

71
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:35,200
hassle of sending patches to linus every

72
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,720
uh merge window and all of the blowback

73
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,480
that you can get from that particularly

74
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,160
if you're a scuzzy developer

75
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,679
so he leaves it up to me to actually

76
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,040
send the pull request even though he's

77
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,920
done all the hard work of actually

78
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,920
assembling the tree

79
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:50,000
um i do have to give you a disclaimer

80
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,840
this talk is wholly based

81
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,760
on personal observation there will be a

82
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,599
lot in this talk you may disagree with

83
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,040
and i'm happy to entertain disagreements

84
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:57,679
afterwards in the question and answer

85
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,359
session

86
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,440
but this is my personal opinion and

87
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,040
observation it is definitely nothing to

88
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,560
do with ibm

89
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,040
who were not very keen on me coming to

90
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:10,400
talk about this topic anyway

91
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:12,799
so let's begin with a fun topic

92
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,480
since almost everybody in this room in

93
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,760
some form would count themselves as an

94
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:18,079
engineer most people would count

95
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:20,959
themselves as a software engineer

96
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,640
managing engineers is a hard problem and

97
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:24,560
it's been a hard problem since long

98
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:26,238
before i was in open source and long

99
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,480
before computers existed

100
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:30,000
engineers tend to be opinionated and not

101
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,560
play very well with others

102
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,640
there's a very famous quote about

103
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,360
managing engineers is a bit like herding

104
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,359
cats

105
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,879
they are very difficult to get them all

106
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,599
to line up and go in the same damn

107
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:43,200
direction

108
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:43,200
and actually work on your project

109
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:47,120
and obviously this means that getting

110
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:49,599
engineers to do productive work

111
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:51,360
can be incredibly difficult and so

112
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:53,119
managers who can actually get productive

113
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,840
work out of engineers in propriety

114
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,760
industry

115
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:58,239
are in very big demand that's why they

116
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:00,319
paid very big salaries

117
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:01,599
but one of the interesting corollaries

118
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:04,159
of engineers is they do

119
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:04,720
actually work best on things they like

120
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:06,959
so

121
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:08,560
i've worked in a lot of proprietary

122
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:09,120
companies doing a lot of proprietary

123
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,799
stuff

124
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,319
and i find the best way of actually

125
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:14,080
managing engineers

126
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:15,599
is to persuade them that they like

127
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,320
whatever the project you're actually

128
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:18,000
doing is

129
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,839
if from a technical point of view you

130
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,440
can persuade every member on the team

131
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:23,679
that actually this is an interesting and

132
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:25,520
worthwhile exercise the job of hurting

133
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:28,960
the cats managing the engineers

134
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:32,159
becomes much easier and

135
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:33,680
if you don't try and motivate engineers

136
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,440
with a technical motivation if you're

137
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,240
just trying to do a sort of managerial

138
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,759
motivation

139
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,040
it becomes very difficult because if you

140
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,160
go and ask engineers what their

141
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,919
motivations are

142
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,840
and a 10 engineer team you will get 10

143
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:45,280
different answers and trying to satisfy

144
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,440
all those expectations becomes

145
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,960
impossible

146
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,240
and as i said this is something the

147
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,159
industry has been struggling with for

148
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,639
decades i would almost say for centuries

149
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,560
i think

150
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:57,199
this problem has been excellent for over

151
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:59,440
100 years now

152
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,560
so let's do an analogy from truffle

153
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,719
hunting um

154
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,240
i made up this slide because there's a

155
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,240
wonderful restaurant just next door to

156
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,759
the ulb called la truth noir

157
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,840
which hopefully i will be enjoying

158
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:11,520
myself at this evening

159
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:13,359
but the other point is i come from the

160
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,240
pacific northwest and a lot of you may

161
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,400
not know it

162
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,160
but the pacific northwest actually has a

163
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,359
truffle industry the climate is almost

164
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:22,400
identical to here

165
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:24,240
and we actually grow very nice truffles

166
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,080
and you probably haven't heard that

167
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,440
there is a massive disagreement between

168
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,560
the truffle gatherers of the pacific

169
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,880
northwest

170
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,479
and the world famous truffle gatherers

171
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,159
in france perigord region

172
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:36,000
everywhere that truffles famously come

173
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,639
from

174
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,960
and it's this americans actually prefer

175
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:42,720
dogs for hunting truffles

176
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:45,198
the french and in fact everybody in

177
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,880
europe think this is a load of rubbish

178
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:47,919
and everybody should use pigs for

179
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,360
hunting truffles

180
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:51,039
this is a source of a massive

181
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,400
disagreement between american truffle

182
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:55,440
hunters and

183
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,960
european truffle hunters so dogs have to

184
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,800
be trained to hunt truffles

185
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,080
but they can they have good senses of

186
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,680
smell dogs

187
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,120
actually don't like truffles which is

188
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,639
somewhat of an advantage which means if

189
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,080
they dig you up a truffle they won't eat

190
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:08,720
it whereas a pig will

191
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:10,318
however pigs absolutely love truffles

192
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,400
the reason a pig is a good truffle

193
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:13,759
hunter and needs virtually no training

194
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,440
is because they will sniff them out

195
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:17,039
naturally and if given the opportunity

196
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,960
we'll dig them all up and eat them

197
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:21,599
this is why pigs make really good

198
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:23,359
truffle hunters according to europeans

199
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,960
americans on the converse think that

200
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,199
pigs are big

201
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,000
smelly hard to control and actually very

202
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:29,680
dangerous

203
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,360
so if you look at a lot of the truffle

204
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,199
hunters of the perigord region

205
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,800
chances are most of them don't have 10

206
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:35,919
or a significant number of them don't

207
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,840
have 10 fingers

208
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:39,840
because if you actually get between a

209
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:41,440
pig's mouth and a truffle

210
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,960
and you happen to be holding it they

211
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:45,120
will take the truffle and your finger

212
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:48,638
off as well

213
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,280
so pigs are good truffle hunters because

214
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:51,680
they have a

215
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:53,520
selfish interest dogs make truffle

216
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,360
hunters because they have an altruistic

217
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,560
motivation all they really want to do is

218
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,080
please you the owner

219
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,000
so if you teach them what a truffle

220
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,599
smells like they'll go and sniff it out

221
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,280
but not because they want the truffle

222
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:04,719
just because they know you want them to

223
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:07,280
have the truffle

224
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:09,039
and the sad fact of this is that pigs

225
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:11,520
find many more truffles

226
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:12,318
the truffle industry in america is

227
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,400
somewhat

228
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:16,080
small and it's for people like me who

229
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:18,000
like truffles is actually very difficult

230
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:20,000
to cope with because i have to go and

231
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,199
frequent farmers markets where the

232
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,280
foragers appear

233
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:24,400
and my supply of truffles is actually

234
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,159
very uncertain

235
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,520
truffle season in seattle is sometime

236
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,160
from november to march

237
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:32,080
but i'm lucky if you know every other

238
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,919
time i go to the farmers market somebody

239
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,919
has a truffle just because

240
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:37,919
dogs are not as good at finding truffles

241
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:39,840
as pigs

242
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:41,758
and the point about this parallel or

243
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:44,719
this parable is that

244
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:46,560
a selfish motivation that the pig has if

245
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,800
you can harness it right

246
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,639
actually gets you far more productive

247
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,560
work than you can get out of the dog

248
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:53,919
even though the dog loves you to bits

249
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,520
and really wants to please you

250
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:57,520
just because the dog is not really

251
00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:01,198
interested in truffles the pig

252
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:03,599
is much more motivated so let's

253
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:06,879
apply that lesson to open source the

254
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:09,280
selfish motivation for doing open source

255
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:10,639
it's actually encoded in our canons the

256
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,559
cathedral and the bazaar

257
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:13,919
by eric raymond contains the phrase

258
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,840
scratching your own itch

259
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:17,520
this is the archetypal selfish

260
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,599
motivation for any engineer

261
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,719
to contribute to an open source project

262
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:22,159
because there's something in that

263
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,840
project they want to do

264
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,520
add to or change they're scratching

265
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:28,400
their own edge

266
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:29,758
and harnessing the selfish motivation in

267
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:32,079
an open source project

268
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,919
can actually make the cats move together

269
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,440
if all the cats want to move in the same

270
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:37,039
direction you don't need to hurt them

271
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,919
because they will actually naturally go

272
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:40,159
there

273
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:42,079
what this means is that open source has

274
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:44,240
a natural built-in advantage

275
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:46,160
because i'm not a manager who goes to

276
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:48,160
you and says well our company business

277
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,839
now is making foo gadgets

278
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,120
and you 15 people are now going to be

279
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:52,880
working on foo gadgets isn't it

280
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,160
wonderful

281
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,080
open source contributors are

282
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,680
self-selected for liking the project

283
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:00,080
so they come to the project with a

284
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:03,279
natural inbuilt desire to like the

285
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,279
project and want to help it

286
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:07,920
and of course if the cats will actually

287
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,760
all move in the same direction naturally

288
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:11,760
it becomes an interesting question of is

289
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,040
a cat herder really necessary

290
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,800
for those of you in the room who are

291
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,399
community managers don't worry i'll give

292
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:19,439
the answer later it will be yes

293
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:21,040
so your job is still not in debt

294
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,640
so let's look at the lessons from linux

295
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,319
because my history of linux goes all the

296
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:26,319
way back to 1992.

297
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,920
so i'll do some of the early history

298
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,279
that i wasn't actually present for in

299
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:32,560
1991

300
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:34,320
um for those of you who most of you in

301
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:36,640
the room will probably recognize this

302
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,640
this is the original uh it's not an

303
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:40,880
email it's actually a news group it was

304
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,080
sent to the compost minix news group by

305
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,880
lena's tool vials

306
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:46,320
announcing linux the 0.01 release of

307
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:48,399
linux

308
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,680
interesting things about this email you

309
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:52,320
don't need to read it all i'll

310
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:54,079
extract the interesting bits is there is

311
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,800
no mention of open source anywhere in

312
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,560
this email

313
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,000
he actually just says it's a free

314
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,680
operating system he's just putting it

315
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,079
out there doesn't mention open source

316
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:03,680
licensing anything and there's no

317
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:05,920
request for contributions

318
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,719
in fact if you read lower down what he

319
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,640
says is

320
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,000
he's welcome suggestions so people are

321
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:12,160
going to tell him what to do

322
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,839
and he expects to write the code but he

323
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,600
doesn't promise to write code for all of

324
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:18,800
the suggestions

325
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,440
so linus at this point 1991 actually

326
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,279
thinks

327
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,600
believes he will be writing all of the

328
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:26,880
code for linux you know this is his

329
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:28,880
fundamental view and of course

330
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,720
really he's treating everybody else's

331
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,160
users i'm going to write the code you're

332
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,600
just going to use my wonderful new

333
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,199
operating system that looks quite like

334
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,120
minix

335
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,800
and obviously contributions in the shape

336
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:42,000
of patches eventually

337
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,399
did come flooding in i actually for this

338
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,160
talk

339
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:46,160
tried to trace the first contribution to

340
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:48,640
linux unfortunately

341
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:50,079
in the time between 1991 and us setting

342
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:53,439
up the kernel mailing list

343
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:54,640
a lot of the actual archives of the news

344
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,880
groups are missing

345
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:59,120
so i have a suspicion that the first

346
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:01,839
ever patch for linux was ted shows

347
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,240
extended file system which dropped in

348
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:05,760
the

349
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,880
uh 0.12 kernel but i have no proof that

350
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,600
it actually is

351
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:11,279
but the point is that even though linus

352
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,279
did not want contributions

353
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:14,880
people forced them on him anyway and

354
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:17,920
what he's discovered is the operating

355
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:19,920
system grew faster because of it

356
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,680
and what this meant for linus is that an

357
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,760
open source cat herder was actually

358
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,519
organically born this was something he

359
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:27,200
was not expecting to do he was expecting

360
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:28,959
to be writing all the code remember

361
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,399
but what he ended up doing was actually

362
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:33,119
hurting the cats and

363
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:35,120
integrating the patches and of course

364
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,800
now we call him a benevolent dictator

365
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:40,640
this is the standard model in

366
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:42,959
open source let me in some of the time i

367
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:45,120
have give you a little aside about why

368
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:46,640
the benevolent dictator model works so

369
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:49,040
well in open source because

370
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:50,800
it's become very trendy nowadays to

371
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,880
attack the benevolent dictator model

372
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:55,599
because it tends to concentrate power

373
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,399
in people whom you might not like that

374
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,360
much

375
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:01,040
but the reason it works so well and the

376
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,519
reason it's extremely common in open

377
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,279
source

378
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:05,120
is because it actually mirrors the

379
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:06,399
technical leadership set up in industry

380
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:09,040
almost exactly

381
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:10,880
barring all of the management stuff if

382
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:12,800
you look at the technical leadership the

383
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:14,399
people trying to persuade engineers

384
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,920
to work on code that they actually would

385
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:17,839
like to work on the code

386
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:19,920
the structure of an open source project

387
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:21,120
under a benevolent dictator is an almost

388
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,279
exact mirror

389
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,399
the benevolent dictator is very similar

390
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:26,639
to the cto

391
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:27,839
you know what's called a weak cto model

392
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:30,639
for the industry

393
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:32,560
the cto has no power so their job is to

394
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:34,959
persuade the engineers to work

395
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,599
bad ctos can't persuade end up getting

396
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:38,160
fired

397
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,760
good ctos who can persuade end up

398
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:41,439
actually satisfying the goals of the

399
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,639
company and getting big fat bonuses at

400
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,800
the end of the year

401
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:46,399
ctos don't do this alone they usually

402
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,359
have a panel of architects or an office

403
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:49,440
of the cto

404
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,880
so a group of people who help them which

405
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,399
actually in the benevolent dictator

406
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:55,120
model tends to correspond

407
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:56,800
to either the maintainers in linux or

408
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,120
the cabal or whatever you want to call

409
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,160
it

410
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:01,760
but effectively it's a head model

411
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,760
and a group that follows them and trying

412
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:05,920
to get contributions and

413
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:07,839
the reason it's so successful is because

414
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:10,319
industry has been playing with this for

415
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:11,600
you know decades and this is the best

416
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,200
model they've come up with

417
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,800
for actually getting productive work out

418
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,800
of engineers so it's no

419
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,000
accident that an open source it actually

420
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,079
works very well

421
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,360
also for running an open source project

422
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:23,599
that doesn't mean it's the only

423
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,040
pro only way you can run an open source

424
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:27,120
project and there have been many

425
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:29,199
interesting experiments to try that

426
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,720
but it does mean the model is tried and

427
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,000
trusted and actually works

428
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,000
so if you're going to attack the

429
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,959
benevolent dictator model you need to

430
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,639
attack it from something else other than

431
00:13:35,959 --> 00:13:40,319
non-functionality

432
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:42,720
like said it's well understood and well

433
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,560
tested and one interesting thing is that

434
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,199
python itself actually follows this

435
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,199
model

436
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:49,519
and guido van rossum recently stepped

437
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:51,519
down so python will actually show us

438
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:53,519
whether we can actually run this model

439
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:55,600
with only a cabal and no benevolent

440
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:56,320
dictator the jury is still out on that

441
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,240
one but

442
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:00,399
since the model is so similar it looks

443
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:02,240
like it might actually work

444
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:04,959
like you said other models are possible

445
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:07,440
but none is so widely adopted

446
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:09,359
so let's get into the quid pro quo trap

447
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:11,920
um i will not be mentioning impeachment

448
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:13,600
or anything going on in america here

449
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:15,199
but i did choose the title because of

450
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,800
that i'm sorry i just wanted to get a

451
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:19,359
cheap laugh

452
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:20,000
all projects that become popular in open

453
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,000
source

454
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,120
run into scaling issues there are no ifs

455
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,600
ands and buts you go

456
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:27,360
from linux tool valves this is my hobby

457
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,839
project 0.01

458
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,959
it's you know about 10 000 lines of code

459
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:32,639
isn't it wonderful

460
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:34,079
through oh my god i've got a load of

461
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:36,079
contributions my

462
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:37,839
wonderful project is now a million lines

463
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:39,120
of code and half the people on the

464
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:41,040
planet are using it

465
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,639
and i have a huge problem accepting

466
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,599
patches because so many people want to

467
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:45,920
contribute

468
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,639
so all projects go through successful

469
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:49,040
projects

470
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:50,880
go through a sort of please please

471
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:52,800
contribute to my project please like me

472
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:54,480
to uh oh my god what do i do with

473
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:56,560
everybody liking me so much this is the

474
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:59,279
scaling problem in open source

475
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:01,279
and in linux the crisis point was

476
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:03,760
actually reached in 2002 which is pretty

477
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:04,560
good this is 11 years after the initial

478
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:09,040
project

479
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:11,119
uh started up till 2002

480
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:12,639
every patch that went into linux and i

481
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,519
believe you've seen greg crow hartman

482
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:16,160
statistics

483
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:17,600
telling you today about how many tens

484
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,839
two were approaching hundreds of

485
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:22,079
thousands of patches emerged by

486
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:23,519
each release cycle every patch was

487
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:25,120
emailed personally to leanness and

488
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:27,199
personally integrated by him

489
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:29,120
this gives you an idea given the patch

490
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:30,160
volume we accept today of why this model

491
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,680
just wouldn't scale

492
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:33,519
and like you said the scaling point was

493
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,880
reached in 2002 lena's just

494
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:37,120
was starting to burn out and couldn't

495
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:38,800
cope it was called the linus doesn't

496
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,160
scale problem you can actually google

497
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:42,959
for it

498
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:45,199
and obviously we blamed linus because it

499
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:48,079
was him not scaling it was his fault

500
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:49,519
and he fixed it with tooling initially

501
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:52,638
we had the somewhat interesting

502
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:55,600
proprietary bit keeper episode in 2002

503
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:56,320
but ultimately in 2005 the git tool was

504
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,320
born

505
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:00,160
and i remember those days very well

506
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,279
because every kernel developer who was

507
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:04,000
also a maintainer

508
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:05,920
spent three months writing git it was

509
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,560
somewhat of an interesting education for

510
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,719
us

511
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:10,239
so i think if you look deep in the

512
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,399
bowels of git history

513
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,759
somewhere in the git merge logic i've

514
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:16,959
actually got several commits

515
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:16,959
even as a kernel developer

516
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:21,519
fixing the problem in the acceptance

517
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:23,360
layer actually avoids the quid pro quo

518
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:25,199
trap so linus didn't know it

519
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:27,440
but the fact that we blamed him from the

520
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:30,240
problem and he fixed it with tooling

521
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:31,680
allowed linux itself to sidestep the

522
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:34,639
quid pro quo trap

523
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:37,199
so the trap is that once you run into

524
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:38,320
the scaling problem the temptation is to

525
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:40,399
flow control i mean

526
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:42,720
you're all engineers everybody knows

527
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:44,000
that if you've got a congestion problem

528
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,839
you flow control it

529
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,680
so the float the natural flow control

530
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:49,839
you would think of is

531
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:51,439
you know tap the source push back on the

532
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:52,560
contributors try and slow down the

533
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,959
contributions

534
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:56,239
make the pipeline flow much more evenly

535
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:58,079
and effectively

536
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:00,000
the temptation therefore is to try and

537
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:03,279
push the problem onto the contributors

538
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:06,799
to raise barriers to contribution

539
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:09,039
um so i've seen people say things like

540
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:10,160
okay but my project has this huge

541
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:11,679
problem with reviewing

542
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,439
i'm not going to accept your patch

543
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:14,799
unless i see two reviews from you this

544
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:16,880
is a quid pro quo

545
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:18,160
i am conditioning acceptance of your

546
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:21,439
patch bribery

547
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:23,280
on you doing two reviews

548
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:24,880
openstack did this also for feature

549
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,319
contributors

550
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,400
one of the things that openstack was

551
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:30,399
very keen on was sustainability

552
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,240
and they believed that in order for a

553
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,919
feature to have sustainability

554
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:35,280
the actual contributor of the feature

555
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:38,400
would have to demonstrate they would

556
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:40,559
stick around and help maintain it

557
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:42,000
in linus in linux we don't regard this

558
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,760
as actually a truism

559
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,679
as long as a feature is well written

560
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:47,840
we're happy for anybody else to maintain

561
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:49,600
it so we accept well written features

562
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:51,039
we don't inquire into whether the person

563
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,678
contributing the feature will stick

564
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:53,520
around

565
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:54,799
except for going through all of the code

566
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,639
review process

567
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:58,639
and having a nicely polished thing at

568
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:01,360
the end of it

569
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:03,520
but conditioning contributions on

570
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,399
mandatory unrelated actions the quid pro

571
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:07,120
quo

572
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:09,039
makes contributors feel used you know it

573
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:10,479
it feels like the project is stealing

574
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:11,440
your free time you're not giving it

575
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,960
voluntarily

576
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,640
because you want to get this patch

577
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,160
stream perhaps your employer has charged

578
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,400
you to get this patch upstream

579
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:19,440
so you have to satisfy this quid pro quo

580
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,120
to get this to happen

581
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,799
and it makes you feel very used and

582
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:25,120
unhappy

583
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:26,960
scaling problems must be solved in the

584
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,520
acceptance layer they must be solved by

585
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,760
tooling

586
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:31,760
they must be sold by the maintainers if

587
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,720
you push the scaling problem down onto

588
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,080
the contributors

589
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,919
you're setting your project up for

590
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,600
failure eventually i mean it will

591
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:39,360
chanter on for a long time

592
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:41,520
perhaps it will be a popular project for

593
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:43,918
a long time but the moment

594
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:45,679
your popularity starts to wane as it did

595
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:47,679
in the colonel a long time ago

596
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:49,520
it's the moment that your contributors

597
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:50,400
will start to remember all of the wrongs

598
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:52,240
you've done to them

599
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:54,320
and start to move off onto the trendier

600
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:56,400
projects if you want to keep

601
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:59,039
a committed contributor base you need to

602
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,039
treat them well

603
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:05,120
so another problem in open source is

604
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:07,439
something called the origin problem

605
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:08,479
open source is a purely pragmatic

606
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,720
exercise

607
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,919
so in some ways i would argue the

608
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:14,080
differentiator between

609
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:15,840
open source and free software is the

610
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:18,080
motivation for contribution

611
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:19,439
in free software in theory to make a

612
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,639
contribution you're supposed to

613
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,320
subscribe to the

614
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:24,400
say the four freedoms or the principles

615
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:25,600
of the software open source makes no

616
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,200
such requirement

617
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:29,678
one of the interesting things about open

618
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:31,360
source is that the four freedoms tend to

619
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:32,240
appear naturally even though we don't

620
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:34,719
require them

621
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:36,400
so there is no real daylight between the

622
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,039
open source position the free software

623
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,039
position

624
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:41,200
as bruce parents will often tell you but

625
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:42,879
the pragmatism in open source

626
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,320
means that all contributions should be

627
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:46,799
considered on their merit

628
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:48,320
there are no real ways around this this

629
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:50,080
i realize is contra

630
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,918
contrary to the post-meritocracy

631
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:53,439
movement nowadays that wants you to

632
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:54,480
consider the origin of the contra

633
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,760
contribution

634
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,600
but the problem you're setting

635
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:59,919
yourselves up for is origin

636
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:02,399
consideration is a very slippery slope

637
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:04,320
so fine you may suddenly prefer code

638
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,960
from underrepresented minorities as a

639
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,480
way of

640
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,799
sort of it's like affirmative action you

641
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,600
may prefer code from underrepresented

642
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:11,520
minorities

643
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:14,240
but once you start inquiring into the

644
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:15,600
origins there are a whole load of semia

645
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:17,760
origins that you might

646
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:19,760
not like as much and if that starts to

647
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:21,600
weigh into your judgment of the code

648
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:23,120
you've started to tie the project to

649
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,879
your own personal attitudes

650
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:27,600
people will notice and eventually blame

651
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:29,520
you for it this is the origin trap

652
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:31,600
not falling into that trap means being

653
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:34,720
ruthless about considering contributions

654
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:38,158
solely on merit

655
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:40,159
and regardless of where they came from

656
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:41,600
inquiring why someone wants to submit a

657
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:44,320
patch which their motivation

658
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:46,480
is leads to this problem and it leads to

659
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:48,480
a very slippery slope and eventually

660
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:49,679
your project can stand a good chance of

661
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,760
dying because of it

662
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:53,520
eventually all of the contributors if

663
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:55,039
you inquire too deeply into the origins

664
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,799
will end up looking like you

665
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:58,640
because you like people who look like

666
00:20:56,799 --> 00:21:00,000
you and if you can inquire into their

667
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,919
origins you tend to

668
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,679
subconsciously bias towards them and

669
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:07,440
eventually they will all look like you

670
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:08,320
which is bad and wrong not considering

671
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,559
motivation

672
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:12,879
actually allows us to have a much

673
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:14,559
diverse base of contributors

674
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:17,200
and it allows differently motivated

675
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:19,039
people to collaborate that doesn't mean

676
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,880
that it works perfectly it obviously

677
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:23,919
doesn't the linux kernel

678
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:25,600
is still 95 white and male and there are

679
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:28,000
several reasons for that

680
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,959
the boy culture that we had going on in

681
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,880
the sort of

682
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,720
early part of this millennium was a

683
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:35,600
significant factor of that

684
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:37,520
but the point here is that we have

685
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,480
deployed other means for controlling

686
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:41,039
this problem

687
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:42,159
besides inquiring into the origin and

688
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:44,480
these other means

689
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:46,240
seem to be working reasonably well we

690
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:48,159
get no credit for it we're always held

691
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:50,240
up as the poster child for the most

692
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:52,559
horrible open source ecosystem

693
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:54,320
but in fact things have become much more

694
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:55,200
civil and much politer on the linux

695
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:57,039
kernel list

696
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,240
since we started to take this project

697
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:00,720
problem seriously

698
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:03,039
and we've done it without really in

699
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,880
inquiring into the origin of the patches

700
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:06,640
we've done it with the help of a lot of

701
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:09,120
dedicated people who sit around the

702
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:11,600
project doing things like outreachy

703
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:12,399
and google summer of code and colonel

704
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:15,918
newbies

705
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:17,679
and contribution prod pro projects

706
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:19,760
that are actually designed to pull a

707
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:20,640
wide and diverse body of people into a

708
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:23,760
project

709
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,960
diversity by the way is key to a project

710
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:27,600
surviving

711
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,960
in order to explore the true problem

712
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,799
space of what you're trying to do

713
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:32,080
in something as complex as an operating

714
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:33,760
system you need

715
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:35,199
people who will look at problems from

716
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:37,200
very different angles

717
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:39,440
that means you need a diversity of

718
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:41,520
viewpoints once you get a monoculture

719
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:43,120
you won't explore the problem properly

720
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:44,799
your solution will be wrong and

721
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,600
eventually everybody will move away from

722
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:47,600
your project

723
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:49,439
so diversity is actually key to

724
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:51,520
sustainability and open source

725
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:54,480
it's just that you can't fix diversity

726
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:57,039
by inquiring into origins

727
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,760
obviously not inquiring into origins and

728
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:59,919
having

729
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:01,840
a load of mechanisms around it to pull

730
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:04,320
lots of people in helps to keep abroad

731
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:08,158
contributor base

732
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:10,320
so dealing with corporations

733
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:12,559
corporations nowadays are coming to

734
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:14,320
dominate open source

735
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:16,480
what i'm going to do is go back to

736
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:17,600
through the linux a small amount of the

737
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,440
linux history

738
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,719
of dealing with corporations because it

739
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,799
was very messy

740
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:24,320
and i was involved very deeply in doing

741
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:26,720
that

742
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:29,360
but sad fact nowadays is that a

743
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:31,760
significant amount of open source code

744
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:32,479
originates in companies and not all

745
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:34,158
companies

746
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:36,080
have the best interest of the community

747
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:38,320
at heart and indeed if you actually

748
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,760
consider it no company has the interest

749
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:43,600
of the community at heart

750
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:45,440
unless there is as i think denise said

751
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,799
a sort of greed alignment between what

752
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:49,440
the company is doing

753
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:51,520
and what um the open source project is

754
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:54,480
going to achieve

755
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:55,279
corporations only act in their best

756
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:58,320
interests

757
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:59,760
this is a truism their object is to make

758
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:02,480
money it doesn't matter

759
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:03,039
how many you know codes of conduct they

760
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:05,120
have

761
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:06,559
how many sort of altruistic statements

762
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:08,320
they make to their board

763
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:09,918
if a corporation is not making money

764
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:12,000
it's not going to survive and eventually

765
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:14,799
the stock market will ensure it's killed

766
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,600
making money is key above all other

767
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:18,000
things

768
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:21,120
and this is why corporations always act

769
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,960
with selfish motivation

770
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:24,719
all of their engagements are

771
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:26,640
transactional

772
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:28,000
i presume since we're in the age of

773
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:30,559
trump i don't have to explain

774
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,559
transactionalism it's basically

775
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:34,720
having short-term goals instead of

776
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:37,760
long-term goals

777
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:39,440
and if the business goal changes the

778
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:41,360
corporation can easily move away from

779
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,880
the project if the priorities change

780
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:44,479
they will drop you like a hot brick and

781
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,679
move on to whatever it is the priority

782
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:47,679
is just moved for

783
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:49,440
and you won't be able to avoid this so

784
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:51,760
you just have to prepare for it it will

785
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:54,320
happen

786
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:57,360
so corporations are the archetypal

787
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:57,360
selfish contributor

788
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:01,440
and this selfish contribution problem

789
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:05,840
generated

790
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:08,000
in sort of the 2005-4 time frame

791
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:09,199
some of the biggest scaling problems we

792
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,039
actually had in linux

793
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,799
when linux became interesting to

794
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:16,559
corporations we had

795
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:19,440
really really huge problems the sad fact

796
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:21,039
is that selfishness does not always

797
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,600
produce the best solution for the

798
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:24,158
problem

799
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,879
in theory a selfish selfishly motivated

800
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:26,960
person

801
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:28,000
should be doing the best thing for them

802
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,679
but the sad

803
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,039
fact is that most of the time they're

804
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:33,279
not what they think

805
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:36,158
is the best thing for them is really not

806
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:36,159
the best thing for them

807
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:41,760
so part of the job of actually

808
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:44,480
doing great alignment between

809
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:47,039
corporations individuals and projects

810
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:49,120
is actually trying to work out what a

811
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:49,840
better selfish motivation for a company

812
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:52,239
would be

813
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:54,240
and persuading them of it this is why

814
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:56,559
open source people who can actually make

815
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:58,080
the transition to the corporate world

816
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:59,600
usually with the thigh-length waiters

817
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,320
because you have so much to deal

818
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:03,760
with it's not

819
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:06,000
true if you can explain

820
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:07,760
to the ceo the marketing department and

821
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,240
the business development people

822
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:12,080
why the corporate attitude to open

823
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,799
source needs to change why the greed

824
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:15,039
needs to be

825
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:17,200
realigned and how this will actually

826
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:18,879
help all of the short-term goals

827
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,400
they'll love you for it and they will

828
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,120
actually change the business model of

829
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,360
the company

830
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:24,559
in order to take advantage of it the key

831
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:27,120
is persuading them

832
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:29,120
that what you're doing now may be what

833
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:31,520
you think is in your own best interest

834
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:33,199
but if you just did x y and z it will

835
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,840
produce a much better result for the

836
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,000
business

837
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:37,360
and therefore is much more within the

838
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,240
corporate interest

839
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:41,439
understanding selfish motivations and so

840
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:44,240
this is the key

841
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:46,000
being somebody who is capable of seeing

842
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:47,600
a better selfish motivation

843
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,279
when the people who are supposed to be

844
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:51,520
the ones who understand it i mean

845
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:53,039
you don't get to be a ceo and a vp by

846
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:55,120
not understanding how to align your

847
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:56,799
company correctly

848
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:58,639
you have to explain to them why the

849
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:59,840
alignment is wrong and how it could

850
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:02,240
actually work better

851
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:06,399
and to do this you need to be virtuoso

852
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:08,720
in understanding selfish motivations

853
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,600
like i said you have to work out what is

854
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:12,000
in the best

855
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:12,879
interest of the contributor the company

856
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,400
whatever

857
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,840
simply because some of the actions

858
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,200
they're taking are often not in their

859
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:20,240
best interest

860
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:22,799
um i could go into lots of

861
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:24,159
a tragedy of the commons details but

862
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:25,520
i'll just leave you with the truffle

863
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:27,600
hunting one

864
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:29,440
i've already explained that pigs make

865
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:31,120
far better truffle hunters than dogs

866
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:32,559
and if americans could learn to love

867
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:34,080
pigs

868
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:35,440
i would actually have a much steadier

869
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,320
supply of truffles in the pacific

870
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:38,480
northwest

871
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:40,399
but americans are firmly of the opinion

872
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:43,039
that pigs are wrong and

873
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:43,760
dogs are right but the problem is if you

874
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:46,158
let a pig

875
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:47,440
into a truffle orchard uncontrolled it

876
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:49,120
will first of all dig up all the

877
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:50,799
truffles then it will eat them all

878
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:52,559
and then it will grub up your orchard as

879
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:54,480
it tries to find more and more truffles

880
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:56,080
it will destroy the thing that your

881
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:58,320
livelihood depends on

882
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:59,199
controlling the greedy interests of the

883
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:01,520
pig

884
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:03,120
is a necessity if you want to be a

885
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:05,200
professional truffle hunter

886
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:07,520
harnessing the greedy motivation is one

887
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:09,600
side of it but controlling the excesses

888
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:11,279
and persuading the pig that actually

889
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,639
if you just find me a load of truffles

890
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:13,279
i'll take you to new truffle hunting

891
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,640
ground i'll

892
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:16,320
feed you three truffles a day or

893
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,760
whatever i will keep my fingers firmly

894
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:19,520
out of the way of your mouth

895
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:21,039
and that way we will have a nice

896
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:23,120
symbiotic relationship

897
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:24,399
whereas if you escape and grub up my

898
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:26,320
orchard i'm going to send you to the

899
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:30,239
bacon factory right this is the way that

900
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:32,799
we actually teach the pigs

901
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:34,799
and obviously you have to work out what

902
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:36,799
is really in the best interest of this

903
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:38,960
contributor this company whatever

904
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:40,399
and persuade them that it is actually in

905
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,279
their best interest this is a hugely

906
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:45,039
tall order

907
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:45,679
i can remember back in 2005 as sort of a

908
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:47,679
fairly

909
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:49,440
i wasn't such a junior developer but i

910
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:50,320
had no ex real experience of a

911
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:52,159
corporation

912
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:53,600
i just become vice president of a

913
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:55,679
startup company which

914
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:57,360
as any large corporation will tell you

915
00:28:55,679 --> 00:29:00,080
is no experience at all

916
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:01,279
and i had to go and explain to sort of

917
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:04,080
people high up in

918
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:06,399
ibm and hp and all of these sort of open

919
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:09,199
source loomers who'd started osdl

920
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:10,639
why what they were doing was wrong and i

921
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,360
got to say it was a very daunting

922
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:13,120
prospect

923
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:14,479
but learning how to do this is an

924
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:16,399
essential

925
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:18,320
feature of somebody who wants to

926
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:20,959
actually get deeply into open source

927
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:22,480
politics and motivations

928
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:24,559
the big problem was with the

929
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:26,000
corporations they wanted to treat linux

930
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:28,000
exactly as unix so they had this

931
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,840
model of how unix operators they just

932
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,640
wanted linux to operate in exactly the

933
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:32,158
same way

934
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:34,000
because then that model of how they

935
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:35,919
build stuff would just transfer over

936
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,679
and nobody needs to be retrained the

937
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:39,039
most expensive thing in industry is

938
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:40,240
retraining and they really didn't want

939
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:43,200
to do this

940
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:44,960
so obviously they demanded a stable abi

941
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:47,279
and they worked with the distributions

942
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:49,200
not the upstream to get their code in

943
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:51,120
the result of this was that by the end

944
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:53,600
of the 2-4 kernel cycle

945
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:55,120
all every distribution this is red hats

946
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,559
who say i think ubuntu was a bit

947
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,279
fledgling by then so it didn't really

948
00:29:56,559 --> 00:30:00,158
exist but

949
00:29:57,279 --> 00:30:00,799
at least red hat and suse had a patch to

950
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:02,320
linux

951
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:04,559
that was actually bigger than linux

952
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:06,480
itself at the end of the 2-4 cycle

953
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:07,600
just because of all the perversions that

954
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:10,159
corporations had

955
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:12,480
forced upon them this is where upstream

956
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:14,159
first came from because it turned out

957
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,919
that in those days we were actually

958
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:16,799
doing a twin track development model of

959
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:18,799
2-4

960
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:20,080
was the stable branch and 2-5 was going

961
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:20,720
to be the new branch and it actually

962
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:23,039
took us

963
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:24,640
two years to produce two five by the

964
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:26,480
time two five came out

965
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:27,760
the distributions just could not adopt

966
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,240
it with all the back ports they had to

967
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:30,720
do

968
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:33,120
it became an impossible problem and it's

969
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:35,440
where persuading the corporations

970
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:37,520
that actually working with the upstream

971
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:38,000
would mean they didn't face this cliff

972
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,440
edge

973
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,600
every couple of years because that was

974
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:44,880
going to be our release cycle

975
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:46,639
and actually having a stable mechanism

976
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:49,120
for contributing to linux

977
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:50,000
ongoing a sustainable mechanism would

978
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:51,840
actually be much

979
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,120
better for their customers rather than

980
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,879
them having to scramble and their

981
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:56,320
customers demanding to know why with all

982
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:58,640
these security bugs

983
00:30:56,320 --> 00:31:00,639
are we not on the 2-5 kernel or the 2-6

984
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:02,320
kernel which was a stable successor that

985
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:03,039
came out a year ago why are we still on

986
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:06,480
2-4

987
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:06,480
answer because we can't up-port

988
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:10,879
the point is that in order to give all

989
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:12,158
these talks that i did in sort of the

990
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:14,080
early 2000s

991
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:16,080
i had to understand all of the

992
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:18,399
motivations of the corporations

993
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:19,439
and try and persuade them why what they

994
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:21,120
were doing was wrong

995
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:22,640
and remember what they were doing is

996
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:25,439
what they'd always done for unix

997
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:27,200
i mean they'd done this for 20 years why

998
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:29,279
the hell doesn't it work for linux this

999
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:30,399
is the question they kept on asking over

1000
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:31,679
and over again

1001
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:33,840
i mean the answer is obvious it's

1002
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:34,399
because linux is different it's open

1003
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:36,240
source

1004
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:38,399
and the development model is radically

1005
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:40,720
different from the proprietary unix one

1006
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:42,080
and oh by the way the reason you want to

1007
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:44,159
contribute to linux

1008
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:46,000
is because it offers the hope of a much

1009
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:46,960
more stable operating system base for

1010
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,039
your customers

1011
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:50,960
than all of the proprietary unices that

1012
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:52,480
are currently at war with each other

1013
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:54,720
over what they should be doing to

1014
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:58,640
actually capture more market share

1015
00:31:54,720 --> 00:32:01,120
and eventually corporations listened

1016
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:03,519
the linux foundation was born and we

1017
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:05,120
actually managed to enforce the upstream

1018
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:05,679
first policy on the distributions we

1019
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:08,080
actually

1020
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:08,880
formed a coalition of corporations

1021
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:12,320
interested

1022
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:15,279
uh maintainers uh distributions

1023
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:16,960
and the like to actually force every

1024
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:18,240
company that came to linux to work with

1025
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:19,760
upstream first

1026
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:23,120
if your patch wasn't upstream the

1027
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:23,120
distribution would not take it

1028
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:28,080
so we get on to the biggest problem in

1029
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:30,559
linux

1030
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:32,158
managing communities effectively how

1031
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:34,639
would you become a cat herder if you

1032
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:34,640
wanted to

1033
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:39,039
a key goal of any community manager is

1034
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:42,000
to ensure

1035
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:43,760
that selfish contribution is enabled and

1036
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,919
you can do this by avoiding the origin

1037
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:48,960
trap not asking for a quid pro quo

1038
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:51,360
and actually generally just assessing

1039
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:53,360
the code on its merits i mean if there's

1040
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:55,039
a mismatch between what the code does

1041
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:56,559
and what the project would like it to do

1042
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:58,240
you can still discuss it

1043
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:59,760
you can explain the engineering reasons

1044
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:01,360
why it would look better this way

1045
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:02,720
the contributor may or may not listen

1046
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,279
but if they listen you get something

1047
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,640
better

1048
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:06,399
and if they don't listen perhaps they'll

1049
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:09,120
go away and develop another project

1050
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:10,000
so there is still the argi bhaji over

1051
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:12,479
technical vision

1052
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,919
for the project and we'll always have

1053
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:16,480
discussions about this

1054
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:17,039
but enabling selfish contributors is a

1055
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:20,320
key

1056
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:22,320
job of any community manager

1057
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:24,158
and you have to make selfish

1058
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:26,799
contributors feel welcome

1059
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:28,640
even if you know because you've examined

1060
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:30,960
the business goals of this company

1061
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:32,000
that once they've dropped this embedded

1062
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,519
prod product

1063
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,120
that they need to get patches upstream

1064
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:36,720
in the linux kernel for they're just

1065
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:38,399
going to drop it and disappear off and

1066
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:39,440
do some other iot thing that's going to

1067
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:42,879
be totally different

1068
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:44,880
possibly based on vx works so you know

1069
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:46,880
there is a finite timeline to their

1070
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:48,559
contribution that's still not a good

1071
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:51,039
reason for not accepting the code

1072
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:52,399
if the code works and is good and can be

1073
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:55,039
made to work for other people

1074
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:55,840
it should be accepted even if the

1075
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:58,240
contribution

1076
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:59,439
is selfish and time limited the code

1077
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:01,039
should still be accepted

1078
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:03,200
and the contributor should be made

1079
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:03,600
welcome doing it you don't make them

1080
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,200
feel

1081
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:06,719
they're working for this shitty company

1082
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,200
who's just going to drop linux and move

1083
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,839
on

1084
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:11,599
you make them feel that while they are

1085
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:13,040
actually contributing patches

1086
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:14,560
and going through the process of trying

1087
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:16,000
to get it upstream they are valued

1088
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:17,440
members of our community

1089
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,440
they choose to leave it later that will

1090
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:20,399
be their own choice but while they're

1091
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:24,079
contributing

1092
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:25,839
they're valued and obviously like i said

1093
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:27,839
the contribution has to be made

1094
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:30,078
acceptable to the company there are no

1095
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:32,078
ifs and made acceptable to the project

1096
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:34,399
there are no ifs and buts about this

1097
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:35,919
the contribution can't be maintained

1098
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:37,520
your project will just become an

1099
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:40,480
unmaintainable mess

1100
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:42,560
as linus often says it's all about taste

1101
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:43,280
finding maintainers who actually have

1102
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:46,078
taste

1103
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:48,560
and who will actually deploy that taste

1104
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:49,760
when accepting contributions is the key

1105
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:51,440
to ensuring

1106
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:54,240
the kernel itself does not become

1107
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:54,240
unmaintainable

1108
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:58,400
and as i think i've said about 15 times

1109
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:00,640
now

1110
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:02,560
understanding selfish motivations is

1111
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:04,160
vital for all of these tasks

1112
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:06,400
if you don't understand the selfish

1113
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:07,279
motivation for why this person is doing

1114
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,960
what they're doing

1115
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:10,960
you're at a disadvantage in trying to

1116
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:12,960
persuade them when persuasion is

1117
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:14,320
necessary that if they just modified the

1118
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:16,320
patch slightly you'll be much more

1119
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:18,640
acceptable to the project

1120
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:19,440
so one of the jobs that all of you

1121
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:21,839
should look at

1122
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:23,280
is can you actually understand selfish

1123
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:25,759
motivations of people

1124
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:26,640
and actually the virtuoso job is can you

1125
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:28,000
harness them

1126
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:30,000
people who can harness selfish

1127
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,960
motivations are few or far between but

1128
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,880
if you can

1129
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:34,000
you have a career mapped out either as a

1130
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:36,480
community manager

1131
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:38,000
or possibly as a c open source cto open

1132
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:39,760
source program office leader

1133
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,680
you're the very person that industry

1134
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:42,560
wants you will be able to bridge the

1135
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:44,480
divide

1136
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:45,599
between the business goals and the

1137
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:47,599
community goals

1138
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:48,960
and thanks to your understanding of

1139
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:50,960
selfish motivations

1140
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:52,720
you will understand how the alignment of

1141
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:53,599
those goals works how great alignment

1142
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:55,439
works

1143
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:57,520
and you will be able to persuade both

1144
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:59,440
the community and the company to do

1145
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:01,759
better work in the interests of the

1146
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,760
project

1147
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:07,920
and obviously with the example of the

1148
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:09,680
pig controlling the selfish motivations

1149
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:12,320
can also be vital

1150
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:13,118
one of the problems with the 2-4 kernel

1151
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,960
cycle

1152
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:16,640
is that we did try to control the

1153
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:18,240
selfish motivations of the corporation

1154
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:19,598
by telling them that

1155
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:21,040
unless they worked properly with us

1156
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:23,359
upstream and we were not giving them

1157
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:25,200
stable abi their patches wouldn't go in

1158
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:26,799
so their prompt solution was just to go

1159
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:28,399
straight around us and talk to the

1160
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:30,720
distributions instead

1161
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:32,480
the only way we brought them back was by

1162
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:33,118
blocking the distribution channel by

1163
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,800
getting

1164
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:36,800
the agreement that everything would be

1165
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:38,880
upstream first among the distributions

1166
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:40,560
if we hadn't caused that to happen

1167
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:42,079
probably corporations would still be

1168
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,560
rooting around the linux kernel today

1169
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:44,400
although

1170
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:45,599
i suspect we've found a different method

1171
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:48,880
of persuading them

1172
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:49,440
but controlling incorrect selfish

1173
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:52,480
instincts

1174
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:54,079
is almost as vital as understanding why

1175
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:55,440
people are doing what they're doing what

1176
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:59,200
the selfish motivation

1177
00:36:55,440 --> 00:37:00,720
actually is and obviously

1178
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:02,640
another key is finding better

1179
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:05,118
motivations for kernel for for

1180
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:07,118
companies if you can do this you become

1181
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:08,880
a very valuable strategic planner for

1182
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:11,119
any company you choose to join

1183
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:12,240
because you have cracked the knot of

1184
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:14,400
understanding

1185
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:16,479
how to do correct community business

1186
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:18,880
planning for business goals

1187
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:20,720
right then this is not to everybody's

1188
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:22,560
taste not everybody will do it

1189
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:24,480
but if you want to earn massive salaries

1190
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:26,960
in industry this is certainly one way of

1191
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,960
doing it

1192
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:30,560
and one thing i have learned in the

1193
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,119
colonel

1194
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:34,560
is that having clear documentation about

1195
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:36,560
what a contribution is

1196
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:38,078
how to make it what it consists of how

1197
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:41,200
to write a change log

1198
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:42,560
is very helpful because if somebody

1199
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:44,879
makes a contribution

1200
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:45,920
that is wrong having a document to point

1201
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:48,000
to that says

1202
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:49,760
okay there's a problem here because you

1203
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:52,160
haven't done this this and this

1204
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:53,760
is really helpful in convincing the

1205
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:55,520
person on the other end of that email

1206
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:56,160
that we have truly thought about this

1207
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:58,880
problem

1208
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:59,839
having documentation means that we have

1209
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:01,359
thought about it

1210
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:02,880
and we have something to point to that

1211
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:04,720
says we've thought about it

1212
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,920
and we're not just beating up on you

1213
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:07,759
because we don't like you

1214
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:09,760
it's written in the document here and

1215
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:12,000
we'll we'll enforce it for everybody

1216
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:15,200
it actually contributes the sense of

1217
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,200
fairness in the project

1218
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,040
and clear documentation should detail

1219
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:21,200
both

1220
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:22,560
getting better patches and setting

1221
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:25,040
expectations

1222
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:26,400
right so your expectations about how the

1223
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:28,079
patch will be accepted

1224
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:29,760
how much pain you're going to go through

1225
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:30,880
and how long it will be before the patch

1226
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:33,200
appears in the kernel

1227
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:34,560
is vital to actually setting the

1228
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:37,598
expectations of people

1229
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:39,440
so they they if their contribution

1230
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:41,359
takes longer than they expected to get

1231
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:43,839
upstream they can actually become

1232
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:45,680
bored and disillusioned and drift away

1233
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:46,799
having a document that explains how long

1234
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:50,319
this might take

1235
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:50,320
helps combat that

1236
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:54,400
and obviously in almost all

1237
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:56,320
contributions especially if you're a

1238
00:38:54,400 --> 00:39:00,079
first-time contributor

1239
00:38:56,320 --> 00:39:02,960
contributions always need modifications

1240
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:04,079
however one of the things you can use

1241
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:05,920
these modifications

1242
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:07,520
as is a learning exercise for the

1243
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:09,359
contributor so

1244
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:11,280
instead of just pushing back and saying

1245
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:14,400
read the documentation and do it better

1246
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:17,359
you explain why it's done wrong for me

1247
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:18,240
the standard bugbear is writing commit

1248
00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:20,078
logs

1249
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:21,680
apparently nobody in the universe can

1250
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:23,599
actually write decent commit logs

1251
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:26,240
everybody wants to document how the code

1252
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:26,720
works i am a programmer i can read the

1253
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:28,879
code

1254
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:30,240
reading the code tells me how it works

1255
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:32,320
what i want to know is

1256
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:34,000
why is it doing what it's doing that is

1257
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:36,480
what the commit log should tell me it

1258
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:38,320
should tell me the why not the what

1259
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:42,640
and eventually with a lot of

1260
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:45,760
contributions to the schools

1261
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:47,680
thank you with a lot of contributions to

1262
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:49,520
the scuzzy subsystem i simply end up

1263
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:50,078
giving up and rewriting the commit log

1264
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,839
and saying

1265
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:53,760
this is how you should have done it and

1266
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:54,480
it's my job as a maintainer to do that

1267
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:58,240
so it's

1268
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:59,119
not bad and explaining to the

1269
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:01,839
contributor

1270
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:03,200
why this is in both their interests and

1271
00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:03,920
the community and the code bases

1272
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:06,640
interest

1273
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:07,839
is really important aligning interests

1274
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:10,879
is key

1275
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:11,440
to harnessing selfish motivation with

1276
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:13,839
that

1277
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:14,560
i think i got a few minutes left

1278
00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:17,680
conclusions

1279
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:19,440
are harnessing selfishness is

1280
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:21,598
an absolute essential for getting

1281
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:23,680
maximum engineering profitability

1282
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:25,359
open source is about 70 percent of the

1283
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:26,160
way there because of the interest

1284
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:27,759
alignment

1285
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:30,078
but getting it the other 30 percent of

1286
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:31,760
the way there requires a cat herder

1287
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:34,079
what we would call a benevolent dictator

1288
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:36,560
in linux but somebody who can manage the

1289
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:36,560
community

1290
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:40,959
understanding the selfish motivations is

1291
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:42,079
vital for helping contributors be

1292
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:43,760
successful

1293
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:45,359
especially if those contributors are

1294
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:47,520
coming out of corporations

1295
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:49,200
primarily because just because they're

1296
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:50,800
acting selfishly doesn't mean they're

1297
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:52,480
acting in their own best interest

1298
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:54,960
and it might be your job to explain to

1299
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:57,520
them what their best interests are

1300
00:40:54,960 --> 00:41:00,400
and it's obviously this is a vital skill

1301
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:02,319
for managing corporate contributions

1302
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:04,640
so with that i will say thank you if you

1303
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:06,079
enjoyed this this is impress.js my own

1304
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:08,000
personal modification of it

1305
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:09,839
the patches should be going upstream

1306
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:12,240
probably never but

1307
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:14,000
i will try and do better obviously it's

1308
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,959
written in html which makes me a web

1309
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:18,800
developer

1310
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:21,359
the entire talk is actually available

1311
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:22,240
on my own personal website under impress

1312
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:24,078
slides

1313
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:35,200
and with that i will just say thank you

1314
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:36,640
and call for questions

1315
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:39,598
so i must have taken a few people off

1316
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:39,598
let's have the questions

1317
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:45,040
hi james thank you for the presentation

1318
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:48,960
um

1319
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:52,560
i have a question about how a

1320
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:55,599
company can plan for the big changes

1321
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:59,680
uh in upstream kernel for example

1322
00:41:55,599 --> 00:42:02,880
so what is more more welcoming

1323
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:06,640
way to do that is to prepare the changes

1324
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:11,280
and push everything uh well send

1325
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:14,078
send a lot of patches or to

1326
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:17,040
when you know that you have a problem to

1327
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:21,200
arrange some kind of i don't know

1328
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:24,400
um discussion uh about the possible way

1329
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:28,240
how to solve the problem to get all the

1330
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:32,160
i don't know opinions so what way

1331
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:33,598
is more uh efficient for selfish

1332
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:36,480
contributor

1333
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:38,640
okay so first of all you have to

1334
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:41,599
appreciate that every open source

1335
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:43,440
project is driven by contributions and

1336
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:45,520
so the contributors are the ones that

1337
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:47,200
actually in a correctly run project

1338
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:49,520
drive the direction of the project is

1339
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:50,720
going in sudden changes in direction

1340
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:52,880
because of this drive

1341
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:55,680
are not unusual and those sudden changes

1342
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:58,000
can stomp all over patch sets you have

1343
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:58,879
if you are a large company the way you

1344
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,720
avoid this

1345
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:02,240
is to be one of the people actually

1346
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:03,919
driving the changes

1347
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:06,000
so if you have a lot of if you deploy a

1348
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:07,599
lot of contributors to the ecosystem

1349
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,920
and you're actually in charge of driving

1350
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:11,520
the project it can actually help keep it

1351
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:12,160
stable for whatever contribution you're

1352
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:14,000
doing

1353
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:15,680
if you're a much smaller company you're

1354
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,680
at the mercy of what's going on

1355
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:19,359
inside the project it's still not an

1356
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:21,359
impossible position to be in

1357
00:43:19,359 --> 00:43:23,200
but eventually you just have to become

1358
00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:25,040
good at rebasing

1359
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:27,279
i've got a few patches for the tpm

1360
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:28,880
subsystem that have been languishing for

1361
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:30,960
about five releases

1362
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:32,720
and over those five releases they keep

1363
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:33,280
on changing the locations of all the

1364
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:35,040
code

1365
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:37,200
so that means i have to completely

1366
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:38,720
rebase my code every time this damn

1367
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:41,118
thing happens

1368
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:42,720
so being good at rebasing if you can't

1369
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:43,680
afford to deploy a massive army of

1370
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:45,118
contributors

1371
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:46,879
is really the only way that you will

1372
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:47,680
actually cope with this you're not going

1373
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:49,359
to stop the

1374
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:51,118
runaway train of a project that's

1375
00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:52,000
changing direction and changing apis

1376
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:54,640
constantly

1377
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:56,560
you just have to cope with it sorry i

1378
00:43:54,640 --> 00:44:00,160
just want to say to everyone in the room

1379
00:43:56,560 --> 00:44:02,078
can you please be as quiet as possible

1380
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:03,440
please i know everyone's very busy but

1381
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:09,040
everyone would like to hear

1382
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:12,240
the speaker on stage thank you

1383
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:12,240
well okay

1384
00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:17,520
i suppose we started late so we get some

1385
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:17,520
chance of finishing late

1386
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:24,399
thank you for the amazing presentation

1387
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:26,400
there are definitely some parts that

1388
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:27,599
i disagree with but what i do want to

1389
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:30,960
focus on

1390
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:34,720
is the selfish motivation it seems like

1391
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:37,760
it was very much of a binary either or

1392
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:39,598
it was the dog or the pig and i'm

1393
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:42,560
wondering what are your thoughts

1394
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:43,520
about innovations in selfishness because

1395
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:45,759
it seems like you

1396
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:48,319
talked a lot about corporations but i

1397
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:51,680
think a lot of times developers

1398
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:52,720
do not capture as much value as they can

1399
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:55,520
for their work

1400
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:56,319
in corporations and is there another

1401
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:58,880
future

1402
00:44:56,319 --> 00:45:00,319
model of selfishness okay so thank you

1403
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:01,040
for the question it's actually a great

1404
00:45:00,319 --> 00:45:02,960
question

1405
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:04,240
the reason i presented it as binary is

1406
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:05,520
because it makes for a much more

1407
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:08,560
interesting talk

1408
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:11,359
but the truth is that it's not either or

1409
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:13,440
what actually happens if you align

1410
00:45:11,359 --> 00:45:15,759
selfish interests correctly

1411
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:16,640
is that a form of altruism does appear

1412
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:18,480
out of this

1413
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:20,560
because suddenly it becomes in your

1414
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:22,720
interest to actually help the project

1415
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:24,880
once you've got the grid alignment done

1416
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:26,640
and everything's working correctly and

1417
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:27,440
you've got the best business plan you

1418
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:30,160
can get

1419
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:31,440
out of all of this you you actually find

1420
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:33,598
that your interest

1421
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:35,280
and the project's interests match each

1422
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:36,560
other for a long step of the way

1423
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:38,720
and you might be doing this for a

1424
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:40,880
selfish reason but you're doing it

1425
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:42,720
you're doing it helps the project and as

1426
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:44,560
far as the project is concerned helping

1427
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:46,399
it is an altruistic reason

1428
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:47,680
so this is where once you get the

1429
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:49,760
alignment correct

1430
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:51,598
selfish motivations and altruistic

1431
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:54,720
motivations somewhat merge

1432
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:56,960
so there's always um a sort of

1433
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:58,720
there there's there's an ideal mix

1434
00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:00,319
between the two instead of waiting for

1435
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:02,399
it to sort of appear like some

1436
00:46:00,319 --> 00:46:03,920
renormalization transformation

1437
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:05,440
if you can persuade your company to

1438
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:07,119
start from that position

1439
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:08,640
chances are they'll reach the plateau

1440
00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:10,400
much faster but

1441
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:12,640
the plateau can be reached whether you

1442
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:14,640
start from pure selfishness or whether

1443
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:29,839
you try and incorporate altruism into

1444
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:29,839
what you're doing

1445
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:57,839
so this is really a question about open

1446
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:57,839
source sustainability

1447
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:06,400
so just to go back to the bit of the

1448
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:08,240
question where you asked why i

1449
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:10,160
concentrate on corporations

1450
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:12,399
and the reason is because i'm problem

1451
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:13,520
driven most of my problems are caused by

1452
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:16,400
corporations

1453
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:18,000
so to somebody who sits in that prison

1454
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:20,240
everything is a corporate problem

1455
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:22,000
but i agree absolutely with you that

1456
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:23,279
harnessing selfish motivations for

1457
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:26,079
individuals as well

1458
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:26,400
is also important i did touch on that it

1459
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:28,640
was

1460
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:29,920
i think only the latter part of my talk

1461
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:31,118
that really became all about

1462
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:33,920
corporations

1463
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:35,920
but remember that in linux we got our

1464
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:37,280
baptism fire of how to cope with this

1465
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:39,520
from the corporations

1466
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:40,960
and that that means it's a feature

1467
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:43,119
product of my upbringing

1468
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:44,319
so it's in my dna so to speak which is

1469
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:46,800
why unfortunately

1470
00:47:44,319 --> 00:47:47,599
i phrased everything like this you're

1471
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:50,800
welcome

1472
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:50,800
and i think with that

1473
00:47:51,359 --> 00:47:55,200
okay one more another question i promise

1474
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:58,480
it's interesting and so i

1475
00:47:55,200 --> 00:48:02,078
i found your uh talk specifically

1476
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:04,240
on talking about diversity uh in teams

1477
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:05,119
uh in open source projects being really

1478
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:07,598
important

1479
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:09,599
understanding both the problem space

1480
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:10,960
better but also having experiences that

1481
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:14,079
people can draw in

1482
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:16,000
to fix problems in that space given that

1483
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:18,400
i was interested that you

1484
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,599
spoke out against things like positive

1485
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:22,480
action and i wonder

1486
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:24,160
what your thoughts are on maybe not

1487
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:27,200
considering that

1488
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:28,879
in the origin of contributions um but

1489
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:30,160
actually when considering when bringing

1490
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:31,839
new maintainers on

1491
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:33,118
i suppose you could call it positive

1492
00:48:31,839 --> 00:48:33,359
action the other way you could look at

1493
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:36,400
it

1494
00:48:33,359 --> 00:48:38,400
is valuing the diversity

1495
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:39,760
of your team in and as of itself

1496
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:40,880
somewhat like maybe you were putting

1497
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:42,800
together a football team

1498
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:44,880
you wouldn't want the 11 best players

1499
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:48,000
you want players that work together to

1500
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:51,200
maximize that space

1501
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:53,359
okay so um i did say that you should

1502
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:55,839
never examine the origin of the patch

1503
00:48:53,359 --> 00:48:56,799
so in that sense i was against examining

1504
00:48:55,839 --> 00:48:59,599
origins

1505
00:48:56,800 --> 00:49:01,760
but i also said that the way we solve

1506
00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:02,400
this problem in linux is to put lots of

1507
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:05,119
structures

1508
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:07,119
in place around the ecosystem that

1509
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:08,480
actually try and encourage a diversity

1510
00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:11,680
of contributions

1511
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:14,160
so i'm not completely against

1512
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:16,000
positive action i just think that in

1513
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:18,399
terms of patch consideration

1514
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:20,160
the positive action has no place the

1515
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:22,480
positive action should occur

1516
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:23,279
in the encouragement of contributions

1517
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:26,880
outside

1518
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:28,640
of the sort of laser-like focus we have

1519
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:30,640
on making sure the contribution is

1520
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:32,640
technically correct so what i was trying

1521
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:34,078
to do was separate the motivations i

1522
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:36,240
didn't mean to imply

1523
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:37,680
that all forms of affirmative action are

1524
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:39,359
wrong because that would have me

1525
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:40,879
shutting down the outreachy project and

1526
00:49:39,359 --> 00:49:41,598
colonel newbies and everything else that

1527
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:44,160
we do to

1528
00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:45,440
help the ecosystem we need as i said a

1529
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:48,078
diverse ecosystem

1530
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:48,640
encouraging diversity in the ecosystem

1531
00:49:48,079 --> 00:49:50,960
through

1532
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:52,480
external means is absolutely vital to

1533
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:53,280
maintaining the sustainability of the

1534
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:55,680
project

1535
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:57,359
without a diverse contributor basis we

1536
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:58,879
don't have enough diverse thought

1537
00:49:57,359 --> 00:50:00,799
to explore all the problems in the

1538
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:02,640
operating system problem space

1539
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:04,480
and without the ability to explore the

1540
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:06,160
problems completely and correctly

1541
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:08,000
we'll come up with the wrong solution

1542
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:10,399
diversity is vital for preventing us

1543
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:12,580
falling into that trap

1544
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:18,989
okay with that i will say thank you very

1545
00:50:12,580 --> 00:50:18,989
[Applause]

1546
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:23,200
much
