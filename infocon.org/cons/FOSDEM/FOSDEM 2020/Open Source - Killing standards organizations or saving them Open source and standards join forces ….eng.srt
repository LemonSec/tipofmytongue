1
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:10,080
okay

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,519
hello everybody welcome to the lightning

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,519
talks at fosdem

4
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:14,960
i want to introduce charles with a talk

5
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:16,800
about open source

6
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,720
killing standards organizations or

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:22,000
saving them

8
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:24,479
okay thank you very much so

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,039
yeah my name is charles zuckel i work at

10
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,599
cisco

11
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:30,080
i'm a developer advocate there which

12
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:33,360
means i get to work with developers

13
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:34,879
a lot help them understand our apis

14
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,719
our integration points i'm also a

15
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,480
developer myself so that helps in that

16
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:41,120
role

17
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,760
within that space i deal a lot with open

18
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,320
source

19
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:46,160
and with standards and really where

20
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,079
cisco is contributing significantly to

21
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,959
open source projects or where we're

22
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:51,520
helping to find

23
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,680
new internet standards and then we're

24
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,600
using those open source projects

25
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:57,440
in our products and solutions or adding

26
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,199
support for those uh

27
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:01,120
those standards within our products and

28
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:02,559
solutions and to me that that really

29
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,919
serves as sort of an api or an

30
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:05,518
integration point right because you can

31
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,439
work with us in those communities and

32
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,920
the standards and in the open source

33
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:12,479
so so i kind of very passionate about

34
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,320
not only open source but also standards

35
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:15,520
and and so i have a bit of a bias here

36
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,720
in terms of this question

37
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:22,240
uh open source whether it's it can

38
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:25,200
or is killing standards or

39
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,199
or helping them

40
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:29,680
you know i think typically when we think

41
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:31,439
of of standards and open source

42
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,119
actually most people don't think of them

43
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:35,600
together uh

44
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:37,680
however i do i don't see them as being

45
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:40,798
opposed i don't see them as being really

46
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:43,040
close friends maybe at the moment but my

47
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,320
what i believe is that they they should

48
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,920
have a really good

49
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,600
relationship together that they can

50
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,040
actually help each other out

51
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,039
and by bringing open source and

52
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,920
standards together i believe it could be

53
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:55,840
mutually

54
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,840
beneficial to both communities

55
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:00,000
so why standards i mean we're here at an

56
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:01,279
open source conference why do i talk to

57
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,119
you about standards

58
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,960
well i do a lot in the networking space

59
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:06,079
working for for a cisco a networking

60
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,399
company

61
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:10,000
and and standards have really played a

62
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,720
an important role there for for many

63
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,480
many years

64
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:16,160
it's really um the uh our our customers

65
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:18,319
they demand standards

66
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,680
uh standards compliance so vendors are

67
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:22,399
really pushed to

68
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,599
to support uh these standards and we

69
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,360
tend to work together

70
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:26,720
quite well actually to define new

71
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,080
standards a little bit like people

72
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,760
coming together in an open source

73
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,680
community

74
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,200
and that's really kind of driven the

75
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,480
market and how well

76
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,518
you define and support the standards has

77
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,640
really been

78
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:43,840
uh key there now

79
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:44,640
the standards process um for those of

80
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,400
you who aren't uh

81
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,720
that involved in it the way it's it's

82
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:51,440
tended to form work over

83
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:53,680
uh years is that it takes unfortunately

84
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,440
usually a couple years at least for for

85
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,280
a new standard from the time

86
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,480
you start working on it till the time it

87
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:02,480
actually gets

88
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:03,040
completed then companies go off and

89
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,720
finish

90
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,239
you know adding support for that into

91
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,920
their products and then and then take

92
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:09,360
them to market

93
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,839
and then you have these products from

94
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,720
different vendors that support the same

95
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,879
standards but

96
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,560
don't necessarily work together because

97
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:18,079
they implemented the standards a little

98
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,959
bit differently they interpreted them

99
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,480
differently

100
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:21,760
so then there's an interoperability

101
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,159
period because that's really the goal

102
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:26,798
right is to have interoperable solutions

103
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:27,519
and so then there's some time that we go

104
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:29,360
through that

105
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:31,599
and eventually it's great because we get

106
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,799
interoperable standards-based solutions

107
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:34,720
out there

108
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:37,440
but the problem is it as you may have

109
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:40,080
guessed it it takes takes a lot of time

110
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,640
and that time was something we could

111
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,680
afford

112
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:45,599
before but with the way kind of the pace

113
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,080
of technology is is

114
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:50,640
increasing that's become more and more

115
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,640
of a problem

116
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:55,359
so then open source on the other hand we

117
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:56,640
see open source coming in and

118
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,120
transforming

119
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,958
complete industries very very quickly

120
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,840
certainly in the networking space that

121
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:05,439
this has

122
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:07,280
been the case um

123
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:09,200
there's just a vast community that we

124
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,040
see here at fosdem right when

125
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,640
people come together can actually

126
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,400
innovate and and

127
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,880
come up with new solutions very very

128
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:20,478
quickly it's very very agile

129
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:23,440
the pace at which people work together

130
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:24,880
and move things forward is really really

131
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:27,360
fantastic to see

132
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,960
and just some examples on the right hand

133
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,320
side you know open daylight was probably

134
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,000
one of the first ones in the

135
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:34,080
the networking space that i was really

136
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,320
familiar with and there's been others

137
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,599
openstack opnfv i've seen talks about

138
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:40,080
that more recently

139
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:42,080
a lot more attention to uh kubernetes

140
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:44,639
and fdio

141
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:46,000
really changing the way the networking

142
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:47,840
industry works

143
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
and and this is this is a great thing to

144
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:52,479
see

145
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,840
however there there is some complexity

146
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:56,320
to open source

147
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:58,320
and open source-based solutions that i

148
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:00,639
think the more standard space solutions

149
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:02,639
probably dealt with a little bit better

150
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:04,080
when you're putting together a solution

151
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:06,479
based on open source it's

152
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:08,320
usually not like you just take one

153
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:08,880
project and it does everything for you

154
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,800
right

155
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,560
you need to put pieces together and

156
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,520
there's some system integration work

157
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,120
that's needed

158
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,639
and sometimes that's really really

159
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,720
complicated because these

160
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:20,240
these open source projects are moving on

161
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,160
different directories

162
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,600
uh different paces there's different

163
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,919
goals of the different open source

164
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,720
projects they're not necessarily looking

165
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:28,479
to work

166
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,160
well together although that's what

167
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:30,880
perhaps you as the system integrator

168
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,039
needs

169
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,880
so you know that that can be very

170
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:36,560
daunting not to mention the fact that

171
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,800
oftentimes there isn't good

172
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,479
uh documentation to help you with that

173
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,160
challenge

174
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:43,840
so there are some things i think with

175
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,520
open source that tend to be a bit

176
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:47,440
more difficult especially when you look

177
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:49,280
to take things into production

178
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:51,840
and if you think about the environments

179
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,960
in which these standards-based solutions

180
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:56,320
uh really play

181
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,320
that's that's usually the case

182
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,960
so you know my belief in hope here is

183
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,479
that by bringing open source and

184
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,318
standards together

185
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:06,400
uh we can really get something better

186
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:07,440
than just the the combination of the two

187
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,280
that they can

188
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:12,479
can each help each other out to make

189
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:14,159
each other more relevant and stronger

190
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:16,240
the idea being that if we are

191
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,160
implementing code at the same time that

192
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,440
we're developing those standards

193
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,360
we could really cut down that

194
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:23,199
integration time in that kind of

195
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,800
ambiguity time of us

196
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:26,800
looking at a spec and you know

197
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,919
implementing it differently we can find

198
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,720
holes in a

199
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:31,758
in a standard well before it becomes a

200
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,440
standard

201
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:35,280
and maybe more importantly we also have

202
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:37,120
some code that we can put in the hands

203
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,799
of developers

204
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,960
to help them start implementing the

205
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,639
standard and in the best case even be

206
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:45,039
using the same code

207
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:47,039
to support the standard in multiple

208
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:48,800
different vendors implementations right

209
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:50,318
because then it's it's going to work

210
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:53,680
much better together

211
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:55,840
so there's a lot we can really um

212
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,880
gain by bringing these two you know

213
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:02,159
communities together

214
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:05,039
and working more closely together

215
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,440
so one example that i want to talk about

216
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:07,680
a bit

217
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:09,120
uh where i'm quite familiar is is with

218
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,039
the ietf

219
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,800
and the itf stands for internet

220
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:16,000
engineering task force

221
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:17,919
really uh historically has been

222
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,919
main purpose has been to define all of

223
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:21,120
the the protocols on which the the

224
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:23,280
internet's based

225
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,800
and i think we've benefited from all the

226
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:27,359
great standards that have been

227
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:29,199
defined there over the years and

228
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,039
networking standards are are no

229
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:32,720
exception that that's a key focus area

230
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:34,400
for the ietf

231
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,639
for those of you in the networking space

232
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:39,919
some things you know tcpip

233
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:41,680
dns http tls these are things that

234
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:43,359
you're probably using

235
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,039
every day even if you're not a system

236
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,919
administrator as an end user

237
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:49,759
you're certainly um you rely on these

238
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:52,080
protocols every day for your access to

239
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:55,360
the internet and things that you do

240
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:57,520
all defined within the the ietf

241
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,759
so the other thing is on the right hand

242
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,560
side there we reject kings presidents

243
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:02,080
voting

244
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,479
uh believe in rough consensus and

245
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,840
running code um

246
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:08,400
for those of you not familiar with the

247
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:09,679
ietf and but with that mindset or

248
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,758
some thoughts of what a standard

249
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,360
organization might be like

250
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:15,039
that may not be what you were thinking

251
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:17,840
it would be like you might think like

252
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:18,400
big corporate membership fees uh the

253
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,000
ietf

254
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,520
is actually very open uh there's no

255
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
membership required you

256
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:25,440
you participate as an individual much

257
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,960
like in open source

258
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,879
and there's a lot of collaboration you

259
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,758
can see rough consensus being the the

260
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:32,000
goal

261
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:34,719
um you know it the whole nature of it is

262
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,200
for people to work together

263
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:38,479
the problem however is i'd say within

264
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,399
the ietf was

265
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:43,120
there was a bit too much focus on this

266
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:44,720
rough consensus and arguing over drafts

267
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:47,040
and not as much of an emphasis on

268
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:49,600
running code even though it was in this

269
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:51,279
kind of motto or charter people kind of

270
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,240
strayed away from that running code

271
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:55,279
aspect

272
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:57,120
and that had some real problems um what

273
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:59,200
was happening in the itf was things were

274
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,640
very slow as i talked about earlier very

275
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:03,600
slow to develop

276
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:05,040
um the community of people working on

277
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,839
these things tended to be the same

278
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,000
people that was working on them 10 years

279
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:09,839
ago

280
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,519
people coming out of school who were

281
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:12,399
talented network engineers and

282
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:14,880
developers

283
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:16,399
didn't really find it an exciting field

284
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,439
in which to work you know the slow

285
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:20,080
standard stuff

286
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,720
so they weren't getting involved so that

287
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,480
tended to

288
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:25,680
make things go even slower and being

289
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:28,160
done by fewer people

290
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,839
and you know maybe this was a good thing

291
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,120
open source i think in many cases

292
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:33,279
started to overrun

293
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,240
uh the pace of the networking standards

294
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:36,000
just because

295
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:38,080
we had open source solutions that people

296
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,680
were developing to their their problems

297
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,600
uh quicker than the standards could be

298
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:43,519
finished so even if the standards may

299
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,320
have had the promise of resulting in a

300
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:46,399
better

301
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,839
um overall solution it just wasn't

302
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:50,240
available on time

303
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:53,760
and therefore uh you know what wasn't

304
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,760
relevant right wasn't useful

305
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:59,439
so what ended up happening then was um

306
00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:01,359
starting these ietf hackathons

307
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,519
and the ia you know the goal there was

308
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,360
really to advance the pace and relevance

309
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:07,839
of ietf standards

310
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:09,279
and the way to do that we thought was

311
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:10,720
let's let's get more

312
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:12,800
let's get more code let's get more

313
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,680
software developers let's implement

314
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,839
things

315
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:18,000
as we're standardizing them let's test

316
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:19,839
things out before we go too far down the

317
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,079
standardization route

318
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:22,959
let's find problems early let's bring

319
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:26,479
what we learn

320
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:27,680
from coding uh a draft back into the

321
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,519
working group and say

322
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:31,839
yeah this works great you know this is a

323
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:34,399
problem these are things that were

324
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:37,040
ambiguous to us and we had to guess

325
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:38,959
if we can bring that in uh to the

326
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:41,360
working group then we can really reduce

327
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:43,199
the amount of time it takes to arrive at

328
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,800
a full standard

329
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,640
and not only that but at the time that

330
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:48,800
we reached the full standard

331
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,680
we have a lot of useful code that we can

332
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,359
leverage

333
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:54,160
to help with adding support for those

334
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:56,079
standards into products and solutions

335
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:57,279
things that are very handy to developers

336
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:59,040
right

337
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:00,560
and in the ideal case we even get a lot

338
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,959
more developers involved in the

339
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:05,359
standards process from the start

340
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:06,959
and that grows the community it makes

341
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,240
this whole interaction between open

342
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:10,319
source and standards

343
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:12,839
much easier and much more natural when

344
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,640
you have the same people working in both

345
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:16,800
communities

346
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,480
um also these these hackathons they're

347
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:21,839
they're free to everyone

348
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:23,040
um and uh that really lowers the barrier

349
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:24,880
they're very collaborative

350
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,560
that when you hear hackathon you often

351
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,480
think perhaps a bit more competitive

352
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,839
going for prize money this is nothing

353
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,760
like that this is

354
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:33,360
basically people with a interest in

355
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:35,279
standards working together to try to

356
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,440
help the standards progress faster

357
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:39,439
so it's a very friendly welcoming kind

358
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,880
of collaborative environment

359
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:43,040
and what we've seen is that the first

360
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,959
one was about five years ago and there

361
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:47,199
were only 45 people there

362
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:49,760
but they did some interesting projects

363
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,440
enough so that we decided to continue

364
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:53,439
and the next one was a bit bigger and

365
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:55,680
over time more and more people have

366
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:57,839
gotten involved to where now

367
00:11:55,680 --> 00:12:00,719
the hackathon happens the weekend before

368
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:03,680
the uh the week of the iatf meetings

369
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,480
um we've had as many as 400 people show

370
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,079
up

371
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,519
if you think about it that the meetings

372
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:11,040
have maybe a thousand

373
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:12,480
to 1200 people so that's 30 to 40

374
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,240
percent of the people are actually

375
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,079
participating in in the hackathon and

376
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,160
writing code the weekend before

377
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:19,839
that has a profound impact on all the

378
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:22,800
work that the ietf's doing

379
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,800
in terms of standards

380
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:28,639
uh we're also seeing uh more

381
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:30,959
ietf work happening in a kind of

382
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:33,279
developer friendly developer relevant

383
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:34,800
kind of way um you know we're using

384
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:36,560
github we're putting code out there

385
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,359
we're collaborating on that rather than

386
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,199
using

387
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,560
say some proprietary tools that have

388
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,800
been developed by the standards

389
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:44,239
organization specifically for their work

390
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,479
so this makes it much easier for a

391
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:49,760
developer to come and get plugged in

392
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:51,920
and start contributing there's even a

393
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:53,920
working group now within the ietf to

394
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:55,839
talk about how to use tools

395
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:58,079
uh relevant to developers more

396
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:59,760
effectively right so it's changing the

397
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:01,839
processes of the ietf

398
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:06,000
so that they are more developer relevant

399
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:07,680
and developer friendly

400
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,240
maybe just one quick example i showed

401
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:11,760
open daylight before as an example of an

402
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,639
open source project in the networking

403
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,319
space

404
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:15,920
this is don't worry if you can't see all

405
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,440
the blocks what i'm just going to light

406
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:20,160
up in green here

407
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,800
these are areas where at least just by

408
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,439
name

409
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,880
uh they're they're adding support for

410
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:27,279
ietf standards

411
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,560
you can see it's all over the place and

412
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:30,240
there's probably a lot more

413
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:32,160
standards involved in other places that

414
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,760
i didn't make green but to me this is a

415
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,880
real great success story because it's

416
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:37,360
showing how

417
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:39,120
support for key standards are all

418
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,480
embedded into open daylight and that's

419
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,920
one of the reasons for

420
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,360
for its success and why people are

421
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,319
finding it great to use in the

422
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,760
networking space

423
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:48,480
is because it's open source yet it

424
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:50,079
supports these key standards so so that

425
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,839
that's really a case of uh

426
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:54,560
i think a good example that i'd love to

427
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:54,560
see more of

428
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:58,240
and along those lines my my call to

429
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,480
action to you would be

430
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:02,560
to get more involved in this kind of

431
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,920
collaboration between open source and

432
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:06,880
and standards

433
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:08,959
um you know one way to do that the next

434
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,959
ietf meeting it's it's in march

435
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:13,199
in vancouver uh we'll be doing the

436
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:15,279
hackathon if you can go to that url or

437
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:16,959
this is the qr code for it

438
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:18,800
find out more about it like i said it's

439
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:20,719
free it happens on the weekend

440
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,839
uh maybe traveling to vancouver is rough

441
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,000
for you but if not

442
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:25,199
you know very easy low low barrier to

443
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
attend

444
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:30,000
um and then there's the next one is uh

445
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:33,199
in summer and madrid so maybe that one

446
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:36,800
works out for you better um so just

447
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:38,880
uh uh you know the goal there being

448
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:40,079
that in the end we'll make open source

449
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:42,399
more usable

450
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:44,079
by the networking industry because it

451
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:46,000
has support for key standards

452
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:47,519
and will make those standards you know

453
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,040
more valuable because they're in open

454
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:51,760
source projects

455
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:53,040
so i think i exhausted my my time or i

456
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:55,920
have one minute for a question

457
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:57,519
oh great one minute for questions uh

458
00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:01,839
anyone have any questions

459
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:01,839
or comments i'd love either

460
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:12,000
have you thought about creating online

461
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:15,199
communities in order to handle that

462
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:17,680
i've been i mean in the i i work in this

463
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:19,439
in the ssid and blockchain space and

464
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:21,279
what happens is people develop stuff and

465
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,320
there are no standards and no standards

466
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:23,680
bodies so

467
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,600
i've been thinking about how we can

468
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:27,839
create online platforms

469
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:29,600
which wouldn't be so difficult like

470
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:31,120
arriving in a place and could be more

471
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:34,480
inclusive

472
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,959
um online platforms like for for related

473
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,600
to

474
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:38,319
to the meeting or related to to create

475
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,720
standards

476
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:42,720
to take that work in a room of people

477
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:45,360
and translate that into code

478
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:46,320
we'll create an app that's part of what

479
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,839
uh yeah yeah

480
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:50,079
yeah great question and great thought i

481
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:52,480
think that's part of what this

482
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:54,160
this work is just one piece along those

483
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:57,519
lines of

484
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:59,680
uh here it's it's using tools that are

485
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:01,759
related to git and github and to use

486
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:03,599
that for collaborating on the standards

487
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:04,959
a lot of people are finding that much

488
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:08,399
easier and better than

489
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:10,239
email threads and one small example but

490
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:13,279
yeah definitely trying to move more

491
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:14,560
into that and virtual meetings are going

492
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:18,000
to become more popular we're

493
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:18,000
experimenting a lot with that too

494
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:23,599
any other questions i think we're

495
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:35,120
finished thank you

496
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:35,120
thank you
