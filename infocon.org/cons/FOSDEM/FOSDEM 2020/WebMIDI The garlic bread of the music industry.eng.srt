1
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:08,400
good morning everyone

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:10,160
as that part of the slide says my name

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,840
is steve and as that part of the slide

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,519
says i'm a little bit of a geek

5
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:15,360
if we've all turned up to the right room

6
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:17,440
and we'll be talking about web midi

7
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,038
for the next 20 minutes or so we're

8
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:21,680
going to go through who i am

9
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:23,039
what i've done to be on the stage what

10
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,119
is midi in itself

11
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,080
so we can talk about what is web midi

12
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:28,480
and we'll talk about

13
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,159
the protocol of midi and some examples

14
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,960
which means i may be playing some music

15
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,800
which is why i have a keyboard and a

16
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,239
microphone

17
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,959
it's just an excuse to show off really

18
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:40,239
isn't it so who am i

19
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,000
what have i done to deserve to be on

20
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:42,640
this stage or it should probably be

21
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,640
called

22
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,960
the ego slide where the speaker brags

23
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,000
about its achievements for 20 minutes

24
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,079
uh not going to do that because i

25
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,920
haven't done anything

26
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:54,239
industry veteran by the way just means

27
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,600
i'm old

28
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:57,038
developer and entrepreneur means

29
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,680
absolutely nothing it means no one will

30
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:01,039
give me a job so i had to create my own

31
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,519
but the important thing is i have a

32
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:03,520
tournament

33
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:07,520
this is the only musical instrument you

34
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:09,679
can play without actually touching it

35
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,798
even though if you go to the museum of

36
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,560
music in brussels

37
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,479
there is a sign on the theorem that says

38
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:17,520
do not touch

39
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:19,439
go figure the important thing i guess

40
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,600
for the purpose of this is that i do

41
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:26,080
like composing music

42
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:28,158
i'm just not very good at it so

43
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:30,400
i thought okay i will do what i can

44
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:33,439
which is code

45
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:37,360
so for many many years midi has been

46
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:39,679
the standard for musicians to

47
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:41,520
um store their music into sequences and

48
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,360
to play back now

49
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,880
mini means multiple things to multiple

50
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,840
people

51
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:50,000
when you say midi that's not enough midi

52
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,759
sometimes will mean the serial protocol

53
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,280
that goes down the cable between

54
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:55,119
synthesizers between computers and

55
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,240
synthesizers or drum machines

56
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:59,920
or other equipment like that midi can

57
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,759
also mean the file format

58
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,600
and there are three forms of file format

59
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:07,520
they've been interestingly labeled

60
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:10,560
format 0 format 1 and format

61
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:12,160
two ah

62
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,760
zero is pretty useless everything's on

63
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,480
the one track but it is very easy to

64
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,040
parse

65
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:18,720
refile format one has got every piece of

66
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,440
music on a separate track which makes it

67
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,680
very easy

68
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,480
and midi file format two used by almost

69
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,720
nobody

70
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,679
but even a note exists some people mean

71
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,239
that when they say

72
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,840
midi and midi is also the hardware

73
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:31,920
specification

74
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,519
there is a chunk of the spec which says

75
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,640
exactly how much current has to go

76
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:36,400
through the cable

77
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,480
what sort of tolerances it has to be how

78
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,160
fast it's running and all of that stuff

79
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,760
we don't need to worry about we're in

80
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,720
the safety of the sandbox of a web

81
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,160
browser

82
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,640
so we don't need to worry about any of

83
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:49,760
them which is lucky because webmini

84
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:51,440
is an api for that protocol and uh

85
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:53,840
nothing else

86
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,599
all the bits that would be useful that

87
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,159
are necessary in a sequencer

88
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:58,640
are not available in web midi thank you

89
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:01,760
for coming

90
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,760
to my ted talk goodbye

91
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,679
this is almost nothing in there so if

92
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,879
there's nothing in there it will at

93
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,879
least be easy to explain

94
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:14,399
has anyone deciphered the message yet

95
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:18,640
that is a midi message

96
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:22,319
if i present it in hex does that help

97
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:23,760
no at least one person is nodding well

98
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:25,920
the first part of this message is the

99
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:29,120
command 144

100
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:30,480
99 and the second one is the channel

101
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,799
now a couple of things you can work out

102
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:35,119
from this hex numbers

103
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:36,319
four bits long from zero to fifteen that

104
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:39,599
means there are only

105
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:41,200
sixteen channels that's part of the spec

106
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:42,879
it's been there since the year dot

107
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,798
it's not going to change uh

108
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:46,560
unfortunately however many web uh the

109
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:47,360
midi spec version 2 has just been

110
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,640
announced

111
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,920
so this talk will be completely

112
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:52,640
redundant probably by the time i've

113
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:54,319
finished giving it

114
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,679
the first bit is the command and again

115
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:57,760
you'll notice

116
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:01,840
it's a single nibble in hex which means

117
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,840
there are only 16 possible commands

118
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:07,360
it's another caveat so two possible

119
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:10,560
things

120
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:13,840
this command dictates

121
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:15,680
these bytes so serial protocol they'll

122
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,440
come in one after the other and it'll

123
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,120
your program will see that first byte it

124
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:21,600
says what is this

125
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,840
it's a note on message at which point it

126
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:28,550
understands that the following two bytes

127
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:35,839
will be a note value and a volume

128
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:35,839
[Music]

129
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:43,359
so the obligatory hello world

130
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,639
apologies for the use of the word

131
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,919
navigator in there it's probably not

132
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:49,520
really necessary

133
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:52,479
um but this is the thing that will

134
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:54,560
take in a message passes it out and says

135
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:57,120
well we know note on is this 90

136
00:04:54,560 --> 00:05:00,479
and we can track it out to the console

137
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,479
so to prove that works

138
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,479
i probably shouldn't say that and then

139
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:08,639
do a live demo i should do the live demo

140
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:08,639
and then so let me clear that

141
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,360
if you look onto the bottom window

142

[Music]

143
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:19,600
one message for on one message for off

144
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:23,759
still only three bytes each time

145
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:25,120
64 volume one um where's the time

146
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:26,240
where's the timing information in that

147
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,600
message

148
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,080
see that can anyone tell me where the

149
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:32,960
time is gone

150
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:34,800
the time is in real life all the time in

151
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,320
web midi is controlled by how much time

152
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,800
you wait until you send

153
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,759
the next message there is no other way

154
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:43,120
around it

155
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:45,440
so you are forced to rely on javascript

156
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,400
giving you very precise timing in order

157
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:50,320
to create

158
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,638
very precise music this is why i titled

159
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,440
it

160
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:54,880
garlic bread is anyone aware of the

161
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,400
peter k sketch

162
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:59,520
the stand up he does where he goes

163
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:02,159
garlic bread

164
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,880
because it's just incongruous you have a

165
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,600
midi

166
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,240
protocol that is for music that is real

167
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,039
time

168
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,479
that needs to have very precise timings

169
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:11,440
and then you go and stick it in a web

170
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:13,599
browser

171
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:15,840
which is sandbox and is not very good at

172
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,520
precise timing

173
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,880
which makes it a little bit painful at

174
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:23,919
times if you're trying to do anything

175
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:23,919
live so let's continue

176
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:31,919
with that so if it's a serial protocol

177
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:33,360
there is one problem with handling it

178
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:35,599
how do you know if you're in the middle

179
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,039
of a message or not

180
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,960
we've established this is the note on

181
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:40,639
command this is the note on message

182
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:43,198
well what happens if the first byte we

183
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,479
read is 60 what command is that

184
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,080
what's it suddenly going to start doing

185
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:47,758
at that point what if we come in here

186
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,359
what about 100

187
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:51,280
well the clue is by writing it down in

188
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:54,400
binary

189
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:57,280
so if this most significant bit is one

190
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:58,400
it means this is a command something is

191
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,440
happening now you should be paying

192
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,520
attention

193
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,680
and if the most significant bit is zero

194
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,440
it means this is the data for a previous

195
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:08,080
command

196
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:09,880
very simple to pass it's one operation

197
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:13,680
ampersand

198
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:14,719
0x80 but i just said there are 16

199
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,039
possibilities

200
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,160
for this number if we're using the most

201
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:20,560
significant bit

202
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,319
then actually we only have eight

203
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,080
possible commands

204
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:27,280
and that's it the entire specification

205
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:29,440
is just eight commands

206
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:31,039
and that and that's these ones so note

207
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,240
off is the most important one because

208
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:35,360
it's the first one

209
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:37,759
no idea why note on it's the second one

210
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,639
although you will find and this is where

211
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:42,000
it gets

212
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:43,680
fun that hundred if

213
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,440
first bite is the command the second two

214
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,879
bytes of the data bytes now it like

215
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:50,479
you have any number of data bytes you

216
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:53,120
like they're controlled by the command

217
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:54,318
this is the volume some keyboard

218
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,080
manufacturers

219
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:57,599
have decided that if you put zero as the

220
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:01,599
volume on a note

221
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:05,680
on message that means note off

222
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:07,280
because obviously it's logical right

223
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,800
so you've got no on a note off the key

224
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:11,039
pressure just for

225
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:13,120
hitting it harder essentially parameters

226
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:14,639
and programs for changing the sound

227
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,240
because although there were no sounds in

228
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:18,319
the midi spec and there were no mid

229
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,160
sounds in the midi files

230
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:22,400
there is still the indication that there

231
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:24,160
would be a sound so you say

232
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,679
i'm just telling you the note i'm saying

233
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,680
this note goes on

234
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,759
this note goes off i'm not saying any

235
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,440
more about it but i will tell you

236
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,360
i would like the synthesizer to play a

237
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,880
piano or a string sound

238
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,640
it doesn't tell you what the string

239
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,200
sound is or how the string sound is

240
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,279
formed

241
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,120
just something in the general area of

242
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:42,719
strings

243
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,640
changing the pressure more after touch

244
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:46,000
thing the pitch wheel obviously

245
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,839
this expensive keyboard does not have

246
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,440
pitch wheel but if you do then there is

247
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:51,200
a special message for it

248
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,880
and then there's the metro events for

249
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,240
everything else

250
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,519
it's like they started designing the

251
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,120
keyboard and they thought yeah we need

252
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:58,720
notes on we need the ability to change

253
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,680
the program we need the pitch wheel

254
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:04,000
oh dear we've run out so everything else

255
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:05,359
is lumbered in this bottom stage

256
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,160
and there are just hundreds of these

257
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:11,440
metal events systems exclusive messages

258
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:12,959
that send patches it's just full of them

259
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,560
this one i know it's it i know it's not

260
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:17,279
h file because this is

261
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:19,760
that this list comes from my original c

262
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:23,279
version of this library

263
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:25,360
and it just lists them all in there

264
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:27,120
so what is message what we're missing in

265
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,160
web midi we've established the timing

266
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,959
message

267
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:32,480
it is missing that is just something you

268
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:34,079
have to time yourself

269
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,839
when you deal with midi files and i'll

270
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,600
show you some bits later you have to

271
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:38,880
specify that time so you have to count

272
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,959
the time yourself

273
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,720
so you say this note comes on then this

274
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:44,800
note comes on and there is

275
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,240
half a second between it you then write

276
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,319
that in

277
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:51,279
the duration again if you don't have

278
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:53,519
timing messages you can't have duration

279
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:55,120
so you have to handle that yourself

280
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:57,279
think about how long each of these notes

281
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:59,760
are going to be

282
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:00,959
chords chords are kind of fundamental in

283
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,560
music this is harmony

284
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:04,399
every single piece of reasonably good

285
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,839
music will have harmony

286
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:08,399
and quite a lot of bad music will have

287
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:10,160
harmony as well but there is no way of

288
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:12,399
describing a chord

289
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:14,319
you have to say this note on then this

290
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:17,040
note on and then this note on

291
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,800
at the same time or as close to the same

292
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:21,360
time as you can possibly manage

293
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,560
in your code ideally you'd want that

294
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:26,480
time to be zero

295
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:29,359
or at least shorter than 10 milliseconds

296
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:31,279
and there were no conventions so if you

297
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:33,360
use one of the system exclusive messages

298
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:35,519
it's up to you how you decide to handle

299
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,959
that every keyboard manufacturer has

300
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:38,240
their own set of things that they put

301
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:39,680
into those messages

302
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,760
and if you want to process them or

303
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:44,560
understand what that keyboard is sending

304
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,560
you're on your own

305
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:50,560
so we've got the protocol is a stream of

306
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:50,560
messages

307
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,079
and i was going to give some examples

308
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,120
but i will have to go

309
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:57,120
out of here for that

310
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,839
let me shut that down

311
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,959
this is the one that i've been fiddling

312
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:06,959
with for the time it's

313
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:17,920
it this one okay

314
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:20,880
i'm gonna put this up as loud as i can

315
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,880
and then flip this on

316
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:29,839
[Music]

317
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,839
if i switch to base

318
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:45,200
now you can tell that there is a little

319
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:47,120
bit of a latency on me pressing the keys

320
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:49,519
and hearing the notes

321
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:51,360
which is unfortunate um but that's

322
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:53,920
unfortunately nothing of my doing

323
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,120
i'm not that bad a coder it is just the

324
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,800
time that it takes

325
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,560
for the message to come through and the

326
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,160
browser to react and the sound engine

327
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,439
inside the web audio engine to play

328
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,719
those sounds

329
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,079
because there isn't anything much is

330
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,959
really doing there that's a web audio

331
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:07,279
back end

332
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:08,239
being triggered from from the from the

333
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:12,079
javascript

334
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:13,279
in the browser now if i that's not good

335
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:14,638
this was just an example this has got

336
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:16,399
nothing to do with this is an example i

337
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:18,560
was playing with earlier

338
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:19,760
i was curious about waveforms and how

339
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:22,399
waveforms have created

340
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:24,240
so i built this web audio thing to

341
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:26,160
create waves using different harmonics

342
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:28,079
i just needed time to hook it up to the

343
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:30,240
setup today

344
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:33,359
but if i show you another one like this

345
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,360
sound board for example

346
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:40,639
if i play notes on here now

347
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,959
i didn't get the looping quite right on

348
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,959
it but

349
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:53,199
all i've done here is i've listened for

350
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,959
the note down message

351
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,560
and when i get that note on message i

352
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:58,239
trigger the sample loop

353
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:00,239
i don't do anything else when the note

354
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,920
up comes i don't stop it when the second

355
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,560
note down comes

356
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,560
i stop it

357
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:10,639
that's logic that's one variable that's

358
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:10,638
one check

359
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:20,880
which you can have hours of fun with now

360
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:23,760
while i'm doing that you might hear

361
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,760
something else going on

362
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:34,720
there's a bass sound going on underneath

363
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:38,240
each of those samples

364
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:41,680
that bass sound the bass sound

365
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,680
from that window

366
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,839
when you open web midi and you say i

367
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,600
would like to do some web midi please mr

368
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:50,240
web browser and the web browser goes

369
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:51,600
sure which would you like and it will

370
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,120
allow you to enumerate

371
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,360
every midi device plugged into your

372
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,800
machine which is great it means if

373
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,120
you've got multiple keyboards you can

374
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,639
have

375
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,160
one keyboard doing this thing and one

376
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:02,880
kid or doing that thing

377
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:05,439
works brilliantly unfortunately it works

378
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:07,040
brilliantly for everyone else as well

379
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,720
so if you happen to have two apps that

380
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,480
are running in different browsers

381
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:12,240
it means you can see the other person's

382
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:14,560
traffic

383
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:16,560
uh i say this because i'm using web midi

384
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:19,439
for music stuff mostly well

385
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:20,880
as much as you can call that music it's

386
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,959
just a loop

387
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,639
but because i'm using it for music i

388
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:26,479
think very much in the music sense but

389
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:28,240
these things are cheap right it's a

390
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,760
tenor of anyone's money

391
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,920
there is no reason why you can't take

392
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:33,519
that apart use the switches and hook

393
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,199
them up to something else

394
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:36,560
you might like to do a game controller

395
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:37,279
which is more accessible than

396
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:40,399
traditional

397
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:41,199
game pads that would make a very cheap

398
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:43,839
and easy

399
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:44,880
accessible gamepad controller and it's

400
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:47,519
controllable

401
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:48,399
through the web browser with web midi

402
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:50,320
unfortunately

403
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:51,920
if you were doing anything sensitive

404
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,959
like you were requiring someone to put

405
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:55,839
in a passcode

406
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:58,399
using those controllers it would also be

407
00:14:55,839 --> 00:15:01,680
visible in another window

408
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:04,000
and currently as it stands there is

409
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:05,199
nothing to stop you

410
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,480
it will be visible in every window and

411
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:07,839
you can't stop you can't say oh i want

412
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,600
this for myself

413
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:11,199
that controller is available to everyone

414
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,199
and you can start that up on your web

415
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:14,719
page without a click

416
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:16,319
without the user having to perform

417
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,079
things if you've done

418
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,079
any kind of web audio things in the

419
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:21,040
browser you'll probably notice that it

420
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:22,880
doesn't work

421
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,880
until the user has actually clicked on

422
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:26,079
something it requires the user to

423
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:28,320
interact with the page before

424
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:29,439
it gives you control of the web audio

425
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,360
device

426
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:34,880
not the same for web midi you can just

427
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,880
look at that traffic at any time

428
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:39,440
another example we had which is probably

429
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:42,480
the

430
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:46,880
most interesting one i suppose

431
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:46,880
is that one i think

432
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:51,909
[Music]

433
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:58,160
and of course it's still running in my

434
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,160
other window so let's shut that down

435
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:03,360
there so again you

436
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:09,839
see if you can spot any latency on this

437
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:09,839
one wow

438
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:15,360
[Music]

439
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:24,079
black which is about the closest i'm

440
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,440
going to get so

441
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:27,359
i'll leave that there i'll quit while

442
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:30,000
i'm ahead

443
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:31,920
and put that back on now this is

444
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,560
obviously a proper example of a

445
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:36,319
synth which i didn't write but it is

446
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,439
quite fun and it is again using web

447
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,759
audio

448
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,639
and web audio has to say you've got to

449
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:42,800
click here

450
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:44,720
before you can actually make sounds but

451
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:46,399
it's a nice example and you can see that

452
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,320
it is possible to build quite big and

453
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:49,519
fun things and at this point i realize

454
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:54,320
the person who's written this

455
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:55,759
might be in the room nope good

456
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,759
that would be awful it's happened before

457
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:58,320
actually um sort of mid-lecture activity

458
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:00,880
thing

459
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:02,720
i was at a computer thing funnily enough

460
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:04,880
me computer thing who'da thunk it

461
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:06,720
i was at a computer thing and i was

462
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:08,640
we're talking about old computers as

463
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:11,039
my friends often do and i happen to

464
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,480
mention this trick on the zx81

465
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:14,879
about how you could put components

466
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:17,199
across the chip to fix the

467
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,000
square root bug that existed on the zx81

468
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:19,919
at the time

469
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,400
and i was explaining how it worked and

470
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:24,240
why it only worked in that case

471
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,919
and then i found out the guy sat next to

472
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,760
me built it

473
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:29,679
and you know the mansplaining level was

474
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:32,960
a 10 out of 10 at that point

475
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:34,799
i mean fanboy was off the charts but

476
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,080
it's what it's one of those things i i'm

477
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:37,440
sure honestly i'm going to give this

478
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,799
talk and the person who wrote it is

479
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,080
going to be here

480
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:42,320
which is a shame because it's really

481
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:47,840
nice i mean that's and it works real

482
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:47,840
time so

483
00:17:54,720 --> 00:18:01,840
i remember back in the 90s you could

484
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:01,840
make a whole album with just that

485
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:07,679
i don't think i should have done that

486
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:07,679
let's do that instead

487
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,760
oh so guys we've got some library links

488
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:18,000
so

489
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,000
let's come back to them

490
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:23,120
so as i'm saying i use this for music

491
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:24,799
but you could create a game controller

492
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:27,360
by ripping out the innards

493
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:28,720
and putting that into you know some

494
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:31,120
something else

495
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,240
as we say it's not keyboards uh drum

496
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:34,719
pads

497
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:36,160
they're very very fun they're very easy

498
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,840
i like those sort of things

499
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:39,360
the novation lump pad which i can't

500
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:41,600
quite afford but they are very pretty

501
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:43,120
and they have lots of lights on them

502
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,639
and you could do you can control

503
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:46,320
lighting rigs

504
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:48,160
when i did some theater stuff a while

505
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:50,559
back the lighting rig

506
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,520
that was a big desk were controlled by

507
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:54,799
midi

508
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:57,918
same protocol no ton meant light on

509
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:59,520
like a note off bent light off but it's

510
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:01,039
it's doable it's a it's a

511
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,799
it's a standard protocol that seems to

512
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:04,240
have gone beyond what it should have

513
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:06,559
ever been doing

514
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,679
the rate of midi is very slow it's about

515
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:10,720
33

516
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:12,720
100 bowel rate essentially

517
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:14,000
um which is slow when you think of how

518
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,280
many notes could be playing in a piece

519
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,760
of music

520
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:20,480
even a fairly straightforward symphony

521
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:23,520
with only maybe 50 or 60 players

522
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:26,000
there's 50 60 notes in there minimum

523
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:27,440
you've only got 16 channels and you've

524
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,640
got multiple notes

525
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,640
so you're probably not going to get all

526
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:32,559
of them playing at the same time because

527
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,760
you can't play all of them with zero

528
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:36,080
time gap there will always be

529
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:38,799
a time gap between each note so it'll

530
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:40,960
never be quite right

531
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:42,080
uh this is the the the slide you might

532
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,679
want to take pictures off if you want to

533
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:47,439
go and play with that cynthia thing

534
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:50,720
uh later uh also there is

535
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:53,840
no file handling oh sorry did i go

536
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,840
for those that want to take the picture

537
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,640
i'm ready for my close-up

538
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:05,760
so file handling is missing if you want

539
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:07,199
to save the midi file you can't

540
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,559
if you've generated something nice

541
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,200
you've got to save it yourself don't

542
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:11,918
worry

543
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:13,840
i've written a library for that there'll

544
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:16,159
be a link later for as well

545
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:19,520
the sysex abstraction so any as i say

546
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:20,640
any manufacturer such as korg and yamaha

547
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,960
they will have their own system

548
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:24,320
exclusive data which that you just have

549
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:26,799
to go and find out for them

550
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:27,600
and any actual sound the actual noises

551
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:29,600
themselves

552
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:32,959
not in the spec it's just an indication

553
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:35,039
that there is a piano sound here

554
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,640
if you do want to have a look my midi

555
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:38,799
library is the second one

556
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:40,480
these other things are also perfectly

557
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:42,879
valid midi libraries

558
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:44,000
uh my one was based on the c plus plus

559
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,400
library that i wrote

560
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,919
many many many years ago i think my

561
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,280
original midi library is actually older

562
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:51,919
than this conference

563
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:52,720
and there's not many things that are so

564
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:56,320
those are available

565
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:58,240
if you've got the pictures now yep

566
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:01,840
so my sort of basic conclusions is the

567
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:03,280
web midi is really interesting for

568
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,480
lots of things support it not just the

569
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:06,158
keyboards the drum machines and all that

570
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,440
sort of stuff

571
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:10,000
very good for handling you can build

572
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:12,480
your own but the output is

573
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,360
more interesting because now the browser

574
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,440
can control

575
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:16,479
synthesizer rigs and it can control drum

576
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,760
machines

577
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:19,919
but the number of people wanting to do

578
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:21,679
that is probably even fewer they want to

579
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:24,159
do input

580
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:25,440
so with that i shall leave it open last

581
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:27,360
five minutes for questions i should

582
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:29,039
update my fosdem scorecard

583
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:31,678
that's now the 12th different talk i've

584
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:33,039
given and i still haven't got good at it

585
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:35,440
so we've got a microphone if there's

586
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:35,440
questions

587
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:38,639
and i love my beer

588
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:42,559
so just another question for the

589
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:45,039
question mark

590
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:45,039
and we

591
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:50,559
so it kind of looks like someone took a

592
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,919
naive translation of a wire protocol and

593
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:53,520
dumped it straight into javascript

594
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:56,080
without any kind of design process

595
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:57,760
um was there actually a design process

596
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:59,760
or did someone manage to persuade the

597
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:01,600
chrome team just to put in this api that

598
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:04,799
no one had really thought about

599
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:07,120
i don't know why or how

600
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:08,639
where midi came to be i don't know the

601
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:10,959
people i suspect

602
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,480
that looking at it they said it's not so

603
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:14,559
much dumping the wire protocol

604
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,919
but dumping what every other midi

605
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:17,280
library does

606
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:19,919
every other midi library just gives you

607
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:21,760
that raw data here is the stream

608
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:23,520
partly because you can't process the

609
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:25,120
sussex messages

610
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:27,760
there's no simple way of abstracting

611
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:30,479
that other than say it's a sysex message

612
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:31,840
and here is the binary blob there could

613
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:34,880
have been abstractions they could have

614
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:36,320
created an api which said on you know

615
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:38,559
with an event and you say

616
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:40,000
i want this function called when i get a

617
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:41,600
note on event

618
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,120
but they didn't do that i think because

619
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:45,840
they wanted to maintain

620
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:46,559
a direct relationship with all the pre

621
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,879
preceding

622
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:50,720
libraries and the way that people wrote

623
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:54,240
midi applications

624
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:55,120
but that's my conjecture yes my library

625
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:57,679
has attached

626
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:59,600
off the github there does abstract away

627
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:01,280
a lot of this ugliness

628
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:03,600
and it handles that odd stupid case as

629
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:05,600
well where if if the note is on

630
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,719
but the volume is zero it actually means

631
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,158
note off

632
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:10,400
which is one of those things that

633
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:11,919
me for ages there's also the other thing

634
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:14,000
as well in the midi spec

635
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:15,760
that if you do a note on message and

636
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,400
then another note on message

637
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:20,000
you don't have to say note on again you

638
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:22,159
just keep going

639
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:25,039
so you don't get that most significant

640
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:27,919
bit being one

641
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:29,760
for the next message so you just see

642
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:32,480
note on it's a three byte message

643
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:33,760
why am i getting five bytes that's just

644
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,120
because there's that quirk that was in

645
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,320
the original midi spec

646
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:38,158
because it will cut down on the

647
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,799
bandwidth used you don't have to send a

648
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:40,799
bite

649
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:43,840
and back in 1982 when this midi was

650
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:45,918
created that one bite was important

651
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:47,439
now it's not but we're stuck with it so

652
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:49,039
we've got these little caveats in the

653
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:51,520
original spec that carried through to

654
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:51,520
webmini

655
00:23:53,840 --> 00:24:05,840
i have a microphone for you

656
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:10,960
so how stable is the web midi stuff

657
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:14,480
could be used for editor librarians for

658
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:17,039
older synthesizers like um

659
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:18,000
i have some old stuff that i need to use

660
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:20,400
an atari emulator

661
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,559
to actually edit stuff on could maybe be

662
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:24,880
used to reliably do that

663
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:27,279
do you think is it stable enough uh so

664
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:29,360
is web midi stable enough to use as

665
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:31,760
a librarian tool and so forth it is

666
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:33,039
stable enough

667
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,879
midi as a spec isn't going to be

668
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:36,000
changing the api is not going to be

669
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:38,159
changing

670
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:41,440
uh there will be upgrades for web 2.0

671
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:43,440
which is coming through the pipeline now

672
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,799
um but it's more the case of do you want

673
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:47,760
to spend that amount of time

674
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:50,720
writing a librarian tool um when there

675
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:53,279
might be better ways of doing it

676
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:56,000
it would probably be good for you it

677
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:57,600
would be good for me some of the time

678
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,039
but because it's coming quite late into

679
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,959
the game

680
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:03,200
i'm concerned that it might only be used

681
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:05,279
for fun projects like this

682
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:07,200
rather than serious projects that have

683
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:09,120
already got librarian tools and other

684
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:15,840
system tools

685
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:15,840
but i'd like to see it more done more

686
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:19,120
i know as soon as someone puts a vr

687
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:22,158
headset down i know that interest is

688
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:24,479
going there and not here

689
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:26,840
you still have two minutes of interest

690
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:28,400
okay so can we muster two minutes of

691
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:31,600
interest

692
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:43,840
no no thank you enough

693
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:43,840
gracefully thank you very much

694
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:46,240
you
