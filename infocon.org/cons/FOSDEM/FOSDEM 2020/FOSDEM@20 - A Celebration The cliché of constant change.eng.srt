i'd like to introduce to you someone who

4
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:18,160
has appeared on the stage

5
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:19,919
17 times before ahu news also asked me

6
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,160
to let you know that he has worked very

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,850
very hard on this presentation

8
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,490
please give a warm welcome to steve

9
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:28,840
[Applause]

10
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:30,479
[Music]

11
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:32,800
goodwin

12
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,719
thank you very much thank you so as that

13
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,640
part of the slide says my name is steve

14
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:38,800
and as that part says i'm a bit of a

15
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,200
geek if we're all in the correct room

16
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,279
and i

17
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,239
really hope we all are in the next 15

18
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,000
minutes i'm going to talk about

19
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:45,038
fostering and how it's changed and how

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,360
it hasn't changed

21
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:48,960
over the last 20 years i'm going to

22
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,719
start off with the origins going back to

23
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,960
2001

24
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:54,800
go through the middle years and then

25
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,360
sort of the later years when things have

26
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,800
settled down a bit and i'm so happy it

27
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,320
started in 2001

28
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,000
it makes counting how many false games

29
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:05,280
have been so much easier

30
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,840
no gate post errors so

31
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,680
where do we start who am i what have i

32
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,680
done that's so impressive to me that i

33
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:14,159
deserve to be on this stage

34
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,200
so we have a slide saying who i am or it

35
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,240
should be called

36
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,240
the ego slide

37
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,399
this is where the speaker gets to brag

38
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:25,119
about themselves for 20 minutes

39
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,880
while everyone else is forced to listen

40
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:28,640
not in this case

41
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,560
these are the stuff i've done oh that's

42
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:34,000
me with hair and a smile

43
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:35,520
neither exists anymore so i've been to

44
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,159
all of these small stem thingies i've

45
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,920
given a stack of talks i've done

46
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,680
little things bigger things but the

47
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,520
thing that's important is what's not on

48
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:46,479
that slide

49
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:47,679
nothing on there says i am fosdem staff

50
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:49,520
i've never worked for them

51
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,280
i've never been a volunteer all i've

52
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,840
done is just turned up

53
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,520
so everything you see is based on my

54
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,960
personal experience of turning up

55
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:59,360
and going wherever there was a free

56
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,360
devil

57
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,439
so where did it start well it started

58
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:06,240
with this little email

59
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:07,679
wednesday december the 6th at 11 o'clock

60
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,000
in the morning

61
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,840
i hope you don't consider this a span as

62
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,120
i think lots of you could be interested

63
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,160
by this

64
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:18,480
this is in the sudo users mailing list

65
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,879
now i'm a user of sudo but i would never

66
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,959
consider joining the mailing list

67
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:24,640
but there were enough people apparently

68
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:27,200
on that mailing list that thought

69
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,679
that's a good idea we should do that and

70
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,799
that's

71
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,959
that's the first line that's the bit

72
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:34,959
that i quite like

73
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:36,959
i hope you don't consider this as spam

74
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:38,959
this essentially is the linus tool

75
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:41,680
valve's our version of lewis 4 valve

76
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:42,800
just for fun this is thing that started

77
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,640
it

78
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,879
if this mail had got itself into a kill

79
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:49,440
file or a spam folder

80
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:51,120
none of us would be here right now so

81
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:53,359
it's because of that bit

82
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,280
that we're kind of lucky so as we say

83
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,640
the origins were in 2001

84
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,480
and it started in brussels and it's

85
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:01,040
always in brussels and i'm kind of

86
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:02,000
happy that it is because the very first

87
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:05,120
indexing

88
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,560
system was created in brussels it wasn't

89
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:11,120
google

90
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:12,879
it was the mundane in 1934 by paul otlet

91
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,319
he had groups of people going through

92
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:16,319
every single book they could find

93
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:19,119
and creating indexes of everything in

94
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:19,760
those books it was a slow manual version

95
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,800
of google

96
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:24,319
but it worked and it was created here so

97
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,799
i'm very happy that's here

98
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:28,399
i'm also happy that it's free to attend

99
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:30,159
not because of the money aspect

100
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,319
this is free as in freedom not free as

101
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:32,879
in beer by the time you're taking into

102
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:35,518
account

103
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:37,440
the hotels and the travel an extra

104
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:39,120
tenant for a conference is nothing

105
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:41,040
but for someone that doesn't have that

106
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,799
that puts a barrier to entry

107
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:45,040
and by having it free to enter it's

108
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:47,280
always been barrel

109
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,159
forget i said that bit can we get it out

110
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,640
of the live stream

111
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:52,640
no we can't so there was a registration

112
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,839
but no one really used it and it started

113
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:58,640
as austin

114
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:58,640
rather than was them by raphael bardin

115
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,840
is

116
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:15,840
what's your name

117
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:32,638
okay

118
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:34,000
thank you thank you so thank you for

119
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,800
coming along

120
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,759
thanks for inviting me um so glad we can

121
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,880
pronounce your name now

122
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:44,240
uh you started this 2001 yes

123
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:46,240
why well at that time it was the the

124
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,400
big boom of free software and open

125
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,520
source and linux was growing in the

126
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,000
enterprise

127
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:53,919
before that linux was not used it was

128
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,720
was not considered serious enough

129
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:58,479
to to be used in the enterprise but then

130
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,400
it started growing

131
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:01,840
and there were conferences but those

132
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,880
conferences were

133
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:09,039
rather commercial you had the linux

134
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:12,719
expo in paris but i went there and

135
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:16,320
i mean i felt like not comfortable there

136
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:18,560
i wanted to to hear technical talks uh

137
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,520
meet people meet developers and there

138
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,639
you had people

139
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:26,159
in suits and talking commercial didn't

140
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:27,199
interest me and when coming back i

141
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,800
thought well

142
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:34,160
let's try something and it started in

143
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:38,160
november 2000 trying to

144
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:42,160
to get people to to come along it was

145
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:43,840
yeah not not envisioned to grow that big

146
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,440
at that time so it sounds like it was

147
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:47,280
intended to be fun

148
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,960
it was intended to to be fun from the

149
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:52,080
start because

150
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:55,120
we we are all here to drive fun no

151
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:58,400
no yeah okay

152
00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:00,479
so we want to enjoy the weekend when you

153
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,719
i wanted that people coming to the

154
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:04,960
weekend enjoy their time here

155
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:07,840
and that's why we have some serious

156
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:10,479
talks about techno technical stuff

157
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:13,280
and some less serious things like the

158
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:16,479
free software song the first time dance

159
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:18,880
but then yeah wait wait wait full stem

160
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:18,880
dance

161
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:24,560
no well people know it people know it's

162
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:27,280

that coming yeah okay

166
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:35,758
the the key thing for the fosdem dance

167
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:49,510
is to be relaxed

168
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:57,599

[Applause]

170
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:04,880
and how did it start well it started by

171
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,919
damian sanders which is known from

172
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,000
ekiger

173
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:09,599
he was one of the first involved in the

174
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,120
organization

175
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:15,680
and he was he was doing a lot

176
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:17,360
like most of us at that time because the

177
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:20,000
team was very small

178
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,639
and he said yeah you know the first

179
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,080
weekend

180
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:26,160
it's always like running running running

181
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,440
and that's how we started to force them

182
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,880
down

183
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:31,440
now you know everything so i was going

184
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,440
to ask

185
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,880
actually as well the first ones must

186
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:37,360
have been difficult to organize

187
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,719
if no one had ever heard of it yeah yeah

188
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,759
indeed

189
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:45,120
it was really started from nothing

190
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,759
so the concept was clear from the

191
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,479
beginning

192
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:49,680
it was a technical conference for

193
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:52,878
developers

194
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:54,879
by developers but then you have to

195
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:57,120
to get people to the events and to get

196
00:07:54,879 --> 00:08:00,000
the people to the event you have to

197
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,560
organize something have talks and to

198
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,479
have

199
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:05,199
people interested in the talks you try

200
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:08,080
to get people that are known

201
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:08,479
and that's where you you start to get

202
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,039
some

203
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:13,680
problems because how do you get people

204
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:16,878
to an unknown conference

205
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:18,879
well that's why it started the weekends

206
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:21,360
that was right before the linux

207
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:24,319
conference in paris

208
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,800
uh i thought that would be easier to get

209
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:28,400
known

210
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:30,720
people to the conference and

211
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,520
it kind of was but then you had the

212
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,719
problem of

213
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:38,559
getting those people over you had

214
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:41,440
costs travel costs hotel costs

215
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:42,239
and it was very hard to get some

216
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,839
sponsoring

217
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:48,480
for the first event but then the

218
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:50,560
i had the luck that it was the boom of

219
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,000
linux in the enterprise there were some

220
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:55,040
companies that made

221
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
big ipos at that time and one of these

222
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:59,360
companies was

223
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:02,399
via linux and

224
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:03,360
they had a belgian there for the

225
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:06,560
commercial

226
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:09,760
side and he decided to support for them

227
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:12,959
which was called ozdem at the time and

228
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:15,439
that's how we got a lot of va linux

229
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:18,560
employees at the conference

230
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:21,440
and we we had the possibility to invite

231
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:22,399
a lot more speaker and paying their

232
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,959
travel

233
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:25,519
and that's how we had some big name like

234
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:28,719
uh

235
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:32,640
slavedov from php we had a

236
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,640
raster man we had

237
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:39,680
theodore from nmap

238
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:42,880
so that's really helped a lot to get

239
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:43,359
people speakers at the event and once

240
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,320
you have

241
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,800
well-known people speaking at the event

242
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,240
well

243
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:54,000
you have interest growing and in the end

244
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:56,480
when gfm started we didn't know how many

245
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,040
people would come at the event

246
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,880
of course that's why we tried to put a

247
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:03,519
registration page

248
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:05,200
at the first event but it was optional

249
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,560
to make it clear you you are always

250
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,920
welcome

251
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:10,719
and yeah we ended up with uh 600 people

252
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:14,399
for the first

253
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:16,480
uh first event which was

254
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:17,600
not expected when i started the

255
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,839
organization

256
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:22,240
but you you felt that the event was

257
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:25,279
growing and the interest was there

258
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:28,160
so it was not a big surprise

259
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:29,920
to have that much people but it was

260
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:33,040
really

261
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:35,040
a good a good thing and yeah a lot of

262
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:38,079
effort went in the event

263
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:39,839
and it was a good thing to see the the

264
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:42,000
success of the first event

265
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:44,079
excellent one final thing there was some

266
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,480
talk online on my mailing lists

267
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:47,920
for people to come in the oldest fosdem

268
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,760
shirt they have

269
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:52,959
in my case it's the oldest foster shirt

270
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:56,319
i have that i can still fit

271
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:59,680
i found this picture online

272
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:01,279
of you back in 2001.

273
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:03,120
do you still have that shirt well you

274
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:06,240
know that's an old t-shirt

275
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:08,720
20 years ago i have a girlfriend she

276
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:15,839
complains that my t-shirts are too old

277
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:15,839
i should change but that's

278
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:25,569
[Applause]

279
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:29,839
oh

280
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,600
thank you very much

281
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:43,839
that's raphael incredible yes

282
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:48,800
so what was 2001 like

283
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,399
i'm pretty sure there were people in

284
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,000
this room who weren't alive at that

285
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:53,760
point

286
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,519
are you laughing because that's you or

287
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:57,760
because you're aware of someone that it

288
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:59,040
to that that's a long time so what was

289
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,319
it like in the real world

290
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:02,719
you know not this cozy thing that we

291
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:05,839
inhabit well the world population is now

292
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:08,079
up to 7.4 billion 7.8 billion actually

293
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:10,000
so we've managed to amass another 1.8

294
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:11,439
billion in the time that this conference

295
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,399
has been running

296
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,360
we've had euros george w bush was the

297
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:18,720
president

298
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:21,519
and the schumacher um had landed

299
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,000
that's a space probe which for the first

300
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:24,480
time

301
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,079
had landed on an asteroid now that's

302
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,200
quite an impressive feat for anyone on

303
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:29,920
eden yeah

304
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:31,600
but this for me is quite interesting not

305
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,000
because i like space and i'm a space fan

306
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,680
that's

307
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:38,399
kind of a given but back then

308
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:39,599
satellites were landed on asteroids or

309
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:41,120
they were sent into space

310
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,639
and it was always proprietary

311
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,320
provincially hardworking

312
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:46,720
we now have open source hardware in

313
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,120
space we haven't saw software running

314
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,079
stuff

315
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,360
we've got cubesats it's now possible for

316
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:52,000
us to be able to build our own

317
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,480
satellites

318
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,680
and stick them in orbit all from the

319
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:59,360
time when this started

320
00:12:55,680 --> 00:13:01,439
to now and i find that quite impressive

321
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:04,320
oh and um billy eilish was born in

322
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:07,120
december 2001.

323
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:09,920
is there anyone over 30 who knows who

324
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,920
billy irish is

325
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:13,199
i don't believe half of you

326
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:18,480
but then again she is writing the new

327
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:20,720
james bond theme so maybe you should

328
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,680
so our pop stars are now younger than

329
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:26,480
this conference

330
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:26,479
and in tech we had no facebook in 2001

331
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:36,639
i had no idea that was an applause queue

332
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,320
i thought that was information there was

333
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:41,360
no twitter

334
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:45,839
oh less than a muted one for that

335
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:45,839
no stack overflow oh

336
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:52,000
found the level have we uh i'm no uber

337
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,800
yeah but unfortunately if it wasn't for

338
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,199
uber some of us would still be stuck on

339
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,199
that bus

340
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:02,800
uh amazon google they're all really

341
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,880
young and the fun one

342
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,959
because a lot of us are linuxi type

343
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:10,160
people um microsoft had released

344
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:11,839
xp that's now end of life microsoft's

345
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:14,560
next operating system windows 7

346
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:15,040
is now out of line we have managed to

347
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,279
pass

348
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,319
two versions of windows one of the

349
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:22,639
biggest companies

350
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:22,639
biggest products and we beat two of them

351
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:29,680
so 2001 in foster terms uh here we go

352
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:32,240
this is not page one by the way this is

353
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,239
all of it

354
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:36,240
this is every single one of the 31 talks

355
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:39,279
present

356
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:40,959
in that first weekend and there's a lot

357
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:42,320
of good stuff on there

358
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:44,399
one thing you'll notice if you can read

359
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,639
the writing every session was pretty

360
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:49,680
much an hour and a half or an hour

361
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:54,000
we've got talks on there um security

362
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:55,279
databases samba php

363
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,720
and somewhere there's a quantum

364
00:14:55,279 --> 00:15:01,040
computing tool there quantum computing

365
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:04,560
back in 2001

366
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:06,480
we were so far ahead of the curve

367
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:09,518
but then again also 2001 was the year of

368
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,519
linux on the desktop

369
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:14,959
if you like that joke you will like it

370
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:14,959
when i do it again in a minute

371
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:19,519
so the early years for me were

372
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:21,599
characterized a lot by these longer

373
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:23,440
talks with deep dives

374
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:25,440
uh we had i hope this name is pronounced

375
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,680
rindahl who created the

376
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,560
rsa encryption system yes he came and

377
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,319
spoke here

378
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:32,319
and gave one of the most technical talks

379
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,839
ever i think just to try and find out if

380
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:35,120
there were any technical people at

381
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:37,040
fosdem

382
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,720
i think it's now safe to say there are

383
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:42,240
technical people across them

384
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:43,440
and he was quite impressed also um back

385
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:46,000
then we had

386
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,959
um clam av which i remember i mean i was

387
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,399
sat

388
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:52,638
there where you are and i was just going

389
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:53,519
wow i understand what anti-virus thing

390
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:55,519
does

391
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:57,040
i understand the code because i can read

392
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:58,560
the code it's open for me

393
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,480
but the bit in the middle about how the

394
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:02,160
algorithms were created now there

395
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:04,639
was something i'd never really

396
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,360
understood and that talk was deep enough

397
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:07,440
and long enough

398
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:10,000
for me that for me to be able to

399
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:11,680
understand it and that's incredible

400
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,959
hey and how is that where you are so

401
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:15,199
you've got to be doing this in 20 years

402
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:16,479
okay

403
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:19,560
what else all this picture by the way

404
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:21,120
just to point out this is i think 2002

405
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:24,239
2003.

406
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:27,120
um you'll notice the lack of food vans

407
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:28,399
you'll also notice the lack of people

408
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,839
this was a time you could actually take

409
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:31,839
photographs of your friends and not get

410
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:33,519
photobombed

411
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:35,040
also i think there's about three or four

412
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:37,040
writers for linux magazine in that

413
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,160
picture and it wasn't intentional it

414
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,680
wasn't a meet up thing

415
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,600
it just so happens that the people who

416
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:43,920
were around at the time just so happen

417
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,120
to all write for that same magazine

418
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,839
although these are meant to be my

419
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,920
friends

420
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:49,199
i'm not taking the picture and i'm not

421
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:51,839
in the picture

422
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:53,839
so i have no idea where they were uh

423
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:54,399
fosdem info desk donations always had a

424
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:56,959
thing

425
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:57,759
uh you know you donate 25 euros you got

426
00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:00,000
the t-shirt

427
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:00,959
donate 50 euros you got a t-shirt and

428
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,600
the chance of winning

429
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:04,079
at o'reilly book or you donate 35 and

430
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,319
you get

431
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:07,760
an o'reilly pocket guidebook there's

432
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:09,199
always these tiers that you could invest

433
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:12,480
in and you'll also notice

434
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:14,000
25 euros back then and still 25 euros

435
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:16,160
now

436
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,480
don't take that as a thing to price like

437
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:20,959
by the way it's just an observation

438
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:23,199
also a fosdem is that a bunch of wacko

439
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:24,559
loonies at your service

440
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:29,280
i don't know if they still use that

441
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:29,280
tagline but it might still apply

442
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:34,639
what else uh there was always

443
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:36,000
sponsorship as raphael was saying

444
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,559
you kind of need sponsorship to be able

445
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,240
to get people in and it is difficult

446
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:42,160
uh va linux was sponsoring the first

447
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,520
year and uh o'reilly managed to pick up

448
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,559
the baton in the second year for a lot

449
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,480
of things

450
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:47,840
but there was never this whole there is

451
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,120
a sponsor and they will be doing a

452
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:51,678
20-minute presentation

453
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:53,520
every day on their thing never happened

454
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:55,919
i really had a standout there

455
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:57,360
that was it that that was their sort of

456
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:59,200
promotion thing if you like

457
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,879
so we've always done pretty well for the

458
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,720
not spamming things

459
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,080
and over these early years the deadlines

460
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:06,000
grew and grew

461
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:07,918
never quickly just steadily a few extra

462
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,440
dead rooms each time

463
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:11,840
doubling up the death room so one day

464
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,480
this room would be on the computing dev

465
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,600
another day

466
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:18,640
that would be the iot difference and

467
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:20,399
we'll come back to death rooms later on

468
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:23,360
to show you some of the success stories

469
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:26,400
that fosdem has had in those dev rooms

470
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:28,159
i mailed miguel a little while ago you

471
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:30,480
probably recognize him from either

472
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:31,919
mono or gnome or something that he's

473
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:35,679
done but

474
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:37,440
he reminded me of the this is coca-cola

475
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:41,360
was anyone there when he was heckled

476
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:41,360
with the line this is coca-cola

477
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:47,199
not many um this stuff about he was

478
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:49,679
demoing mono

479
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,240
and showcasing the different uses and

480
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:53,520
one of them

481
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:54,799
was with unity which is a proprietary 3d

482
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,240
graphics engine

483
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:58,080
and he was demonstrating that it would

484
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,120
work not that he was necessarily

485
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,399
promoting unity

486
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:02,559
so from the back of the room someone

487
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:05,840
shouted this is coca-cola

488
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:07,120
this is coca-cola which didn't make any

489
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,840
sense thought it was a translation

490
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,280
problem

491
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:11,039
what it actually transpired is that the

492
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:12,240
person didn't like the idea of

493
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:15,120
proprietary software

494
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:16,640
being used with free software and that

495
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:19,039
sort of thing was not uncommon

496
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:20,960
not the heckling of this is coca-cola

497
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:24,000
but the idea of proprietary things were

498
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:25,919
always bad and it was always evil

499
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,440
nowadays half of you may well have an

500
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:31,919
iphone

501
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:31,919
i'm using a mac yeah

502
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:37,200
actually i think i've got 50 50 of the

503
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:38,880
move on that one

504
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,640
uh but i can guarantee if i had done

505
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:43,200
that in 2001 with a mac

506
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:44,240
it would have been more 99 to 1 against

507
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:47,520
me

508
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:50,000
we have at least grown up in that sense

509
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:51,120
because i i don't like my mac but i use

510
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,480
it

511
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:57,760
to be fair um what else does that

512
00:19:54,480 --> 00:20:00,000
um she was manning the o'reilly stool

513
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,960
um for the longest time and if you're

514
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,880
watching she said

515
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:07,039
hello it's this is not going to end good

516
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,039
uh

517
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:21,280
stand for the longest time it was

518
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:23,520
actually her that managed to get us

519
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:25,440
the second round of funding for the uh

520
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,840
second costume which would be the first

521
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,400
real

522
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:29,120
foster rather than austen the male went

523
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,720
into her

524
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,918
spam folder essentially it's like oh

525
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,520
yeah i'll look at it later i'll look at

526
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:34,720
later i'll get round to it

527
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:36,559
and it wasn't another thing until i

528
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:38,320
think raphael is the one that nailed

529
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:39,840
back a couple weeks before and says

530
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,600
are you going to give us the money or

531
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:44,320
not and she went oh

532
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:45,280
sorry yeah i'll get on to it and because

533
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:47,760
of that

534
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:48,960
we're able to get a second round and as

535
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,600
a consequence get the third and the

536
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,880
fourth and

537
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:53,039
o'reilly have managed to have a stand

538
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:55,679
here no she is and we know why they're

539
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:58,400
not here this year unfortunately

540
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:58,400
so next up

541
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:05,200
it's gonna boot okay can we switch to

542
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,200
that one

543
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:09,840
so here we have a technical reason why i

544
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:11,280
hate my mac

545
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:13,120
and i have no idea why this is not a

546
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:17,840
microphone that's my mic i just did that

547
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:17,840
like a microphone

548
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:21,918
what's in this stuff

549
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,159
i thought i'll get myself a nice little

550
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:27,760
beer i've always done this by the way

551
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:29,600
i don't know if anyone's ever noticed

552
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,000
when i first started doing fosdem i

553
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,439
didn't

554
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,440
see anyone drinking beer while they were

555
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,480
presenting i thought it was like a

556
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,840
health and safety thing

557
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:38,159
the university didn't allow it something

558
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:39,039
like that but i got to do my first talk

559
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:42,159
and i thought

560
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:43,840
i'm in belgium i should try and fit in

561
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:45,679
belgians eat chocolate and they drink

562
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:48,320
beer

563
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:48,799
i should drink beer when i do my talk so

564
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,879
i

565
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:52,559
got a beer and i put it on the top and

566
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:55,520
no one told me to take it away

567
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:59,678
so i thought oh maybe beer is allowed so

568
00:21:55,520 --> 00:22:01,600
then i opened the beer they went

569
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:03,280
no one's ears picked up and said oh he's

570
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:05,760
doing beer that's not allowed

571
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,480
so i just started to talk right here we

572
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:09,039
go

573
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:10,640
and i've done it everything ever since

574
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:11,440
which is a nice sort of tradition to

575
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,960
have

576
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:15,679
until you start getting multiple talks

577
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,679
in the same day

578
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,520
and you realize this is really not

579
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:21,520
healthy

580
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:22,960
i mean this is my third today the third

581
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,960
bit and the third talk

582
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:27,840
so already maybe that's why i'm using it

583
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:29,280
as a microphone who knows

584
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:31,520
but it is one of those things that you

585
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:32,799
just every year you learn something new

586
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:35,840
about either the place

587
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:36,240
or the culture and it happens quite a

588
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:39,199
lot

589
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:40,000
um one year we decided okay we've done

590
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,480
the four stem thing

591
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,919
but we've never done the brussels thing

592
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:46,159
every year we would come along

593
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:47,840
we'd see the inside of the theaters here

594
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:48,240
and we'd see the inside of the bars out

595
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,360
there

596
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,520
but we'd never see anything else in

597
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:53,918
brussels well it's not in the daylight

598
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:55,679
so we thought next year we'll take a day

599
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:57,919
off work and we'll stay sunday night

600
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:59,200
and see brussels on the monday and

601
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:02,159
that's what we did

602
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:03,600
booked extra hotel booked the train we

603
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:05,919
go along fantastic

604
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:07,600
we had a list of museums to see and this

605
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:09,039
is back before google and stuff so we

606
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:11,678
were just relying on

607
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:13,120
uh guidebooks essentially and we made

608
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:13,440
the list of all the museums we wanted to

609
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,879
see

610
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:17,280
and we got up nice and early at 10

611
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:19,280
o'clock to go see the museums

612
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:21,280
turns out all the museums and all the

613
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:23,440
galleries in brussels

614
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:25,600
uh oh you know the museum of comics open

615
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:27,120
brackets family learning

616
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:29,280
now i don't know what a female ending

617
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:30,799
museum is but all the museums in

618
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:33,840
brussels were also

619
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:35,039
run by female alumni it took me a while

620
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,879
to learn enough french

621
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:38,559
to realize that family lundy means

622
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:42,080
closed on monday

623
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:42,080
and we are just wasted a day

624
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:45,678
luckily we now have translation apps

625
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,200
which allow me to be

626
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:48,880
the stupid englishman that only speaks

627
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:51,520
one language to

628
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:53,360
get around brussels and this is one of

629
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:54,960
those many things that come out

630
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:57,279
especially the social element of

631
00:23:54,960 --> 00:24:00,320
brussels and of course them

632
00:23:57,279 --> 00:24:00,320
so we're ready to go again

633
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:06,000
okay so the first few years from about

634
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:09,918
2000 to

635
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:12,080
2000 2001 to 2007 followed pretty much

636
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:13,520
the same idea you have a number of main

637
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:16,000
tracks in here

638
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:16,639
you have a number of dead rooms and

639
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,000
every year

640
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:22,159
it goes up by one or two more different

641
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,440
by 2007 the formats have kind of

642
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:25,360
stabilized

643
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:28,000
lightning talks had been introduced

644
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:30,158
which back then were quite a novelty

645
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,320
15 minutes each talk now with a lot of

646
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:34,159
talks coming down to 25

647
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:35,439
there's a lot more parallels between new

648
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:37,360
and old as you see

649
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,960
things haven't really changed and that

650
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:41,360
was the inspiration for the title

651
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:42,880
the cliche of constant change the whole

652
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:45,360
thing of the more things change

653
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:46,320
the more they stay the same so a lot of

654
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,678
the main talks now

655
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:50,000
are becoming more like the lightning

656
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:51,200
talks were back then

657
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,919
and those stats will definitely be

658
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:56,159
erroneous i can tell you that

659
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:57,520
so so yes we talked about josette and

660
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:59,440
here are the basic sentences i just say

661
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:01,360
they go up gradually always up and to

662
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:02,159
the right all the stats you'll see go up

663
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:04,879
and to the right

664
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:04,880
that's important

665
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,719
so what sort of milestones have we got

666
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:12,080
over those early

667
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:14,080
first few years so 2002 we hosted the

668
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:16,720
three software awards on this stage so

669
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:18,879
naturally the award of 2001 was given in

670
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:20,799
february 2002 and so on

671
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:22,480
so all the famous names came along to

672
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:24,158
stand on the stage and tell us

673
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:26,559
what they'd done and why that was

674
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:26,559
important

675
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:32,240
keystoning parties started in 2005. i

676
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:35,039
personally call them keysighting events

677
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:36,400
people standing outside in the cold in

678
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:38,480
february in brussels

679
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:41,600
doesn't sound like a party to me but if

680
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:44,159
that's your bag you go for it

681
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:45,199
keep signing events uh the lightning

682
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:48,080
talks as i've said

683
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:49,919
they did start in 2005 but back then not

684
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:52,879
every talk was updated on the site

685
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:54,720
there was a cms from 2002 onwards but

686
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:55,760
not everyone was forced to put their

687
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,919
information into it

688
00:25:55,760 --> 00:26:01,200
at the start so a lot of those earlier

689
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:01,200
talks will have been lost

690
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:06,559
2012 however we have pentagon for those

691
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:08,639
that have not spoken here this is the

692
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:10,559
system you have to put your details in

693
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:12,159
about what you wish to speak about

694
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:14,240
and what the topic's going to be and

695
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:16,320
what room you think it applies

696
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:18,159
it's a big chunk of xml but it does kind

697
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:19,918
of work even though it has occasionally

698
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:22,840
put the same speaker in two different

699
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:25,919
rooms at the same time

700
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:28,879
happens uh 2014.

701
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:30,880
kristoff created an app uh was quite a

702
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:31,200
 recall my slides i think there's

703
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,600
about

704
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:34,320
yes four thousand active installations

705
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,600
um

706
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,960
but that doesn't include anything on

707
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,320
asteroid because that stuff apparently

708
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,760
is not tracked

709
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:41,200
so there's probably a lot more people

710
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:43,760
have installed that than actually on

711
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,760
screen now

712
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:48,480
according to the people i spoke to

713
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,880
earlier the first video box is these

714
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:51,440
nice

715
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:53,679
wooden ones they were first created and

716
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:55,600
put together in 2015 and then first put

717
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:58,640
into boxes 2016.

718
00:26:55,600 --> 00:27:00,399
so that's quite a relatively new thing

719
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:03,200
but even before that people were setting

720
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:04,960
up cameras on tables and just filming it

721
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,720
there used to be an old website called i

722
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:08,240
think open source dot tv

723
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,720
where people would upload these sort of

724
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:13,120
videos and that's noticeable because

725
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:15,200
the conference is older than youtube

726
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:16,559
it's also older than flickr as well

727
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,320
and we'll come to a good meeting to that

728
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:21,120
as well later

729
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:23,039
and 2016 very importantly we started

730
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:26,239
having glossy brochures

731
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:28,158
now for those that weren't there

732
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:29,440
let me show you what the brochures used

733
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:31,200
to look like

734
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:32,960
when i was a wee kid and always for

735
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:35,919
fields

736
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:37,679
this it's probably so small you probably

737
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:39,279
can't see it at the back

738
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:41,279
it's a couple of sheets of paper stapled

739
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:42,320
together and that's the entire

740
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:45,120
conference program

741
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:46,960
everything fast forward a couple of

742
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:50,000
years this is 2002.

743
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:51,440
this is 2008. you can see already that

744
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,799
by 2008

745
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:56,080
fosdem were having to buy a more

746
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:56,080
expensive brand of staple

747
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:59,919
for some reason 2015 had a different

748
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:03,120
color

749
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:04,159
but then by 2016 we have these these are

750
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,120
the ones that you probably all now

751
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:07,120
recognize

752
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:11,039
big glossies and enough information to

753
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:11,039
warrant a separate one for each day

754
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:17,840
quite an impressive feat particularly as

755
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:17,840
i've still got them

756
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:22,080
so coming back to the cliche of constant

757
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:23,440
change every year the dev rooms change

758
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:26,080
there's a few more

759
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:28,640
sometimes old ones fall out of favor but

760
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:30,000
they're always there

761
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,840
stalls is an introduction there's always

762
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,000
lots and lots of stores and for this i

763
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:36,879
will need to find

764
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,559
some notes because that is going to be

765
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:41,360
quite interesting

766
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:41,360
honestly it will be

767
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,840
so yeah

768
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:49,520
there were lots and lots of things going

769
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:50,559
on actually i'm going to come back to

770
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:53,200
that i think that there's a

771
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:55,039
reason for that so going back quickly to

772
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:57,600
the dev rooms

773
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:58,879
the dev rooms have often changed their

774
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:01,360
names

775
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:02,320
so sometimes it will be the mysql death

776
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:05,199
room

777
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:06,960
sometimes it will be the mysql maria db

778
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:08,559
and friends deaf room

779
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:10,640
sometimes it will be the mysql and

780
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:12,399
friends deaf room

781
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:13,600
yeah i don't know what maria dv to want

782
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:14,320
not being considered a friend in the

783
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:17,199
other one

784
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:20,080
but i've yet to see a postgres and mysql

785
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:23,279
and friends devroom

786
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:23,279
can anyone tell me why

787
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:27,840
so there was a there was a case in this

788
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:29,279
in

789
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:31,120
in k building which is where most of the

790
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:32,720
stands are now and

791
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:34,799
there was a time open souza got beer i

792
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:36,480
think they've done it again this year

793
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:38,559
and they've got a number of open source

794
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:39,520
of beers at this stand um the mozilla

795
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:42,240
people

796
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:42,639
of so i'm told went over to their stand

797
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,559
bought

798
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:46,720
all of their beer and took it back to

799
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:48,240
the mozilla stand

800
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:50,480
the mozilla people then put a sticky

801
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:53,120
label on all of the beers

802
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:54,000
and sold it on their stand therefore

803
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:56,639
that is the first

804
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:59,200
time anyone has taken a beer and then

805
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,200
forked it

806
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:06,640
there's also stories of people who have

807
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:07,840
driven here back in 2001 2002

808
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:10,080
which is impressive from the point of

809
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:10,480
view of there was no gps of humans back

810
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,720
then

811
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:14,399
it was all military grade so the people

812
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:16,880
driving around with paper maps trying to

813
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:19,039
work out how to get here

814
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:20,000
that must have been fun we've got a

815
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:21,600
number of dev room

816
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,120
wins which are some of which i'll come

817
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:24,639
back to later

818
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:26,399
but one of the ones to actually point

819
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:28,480
out is freedom box

820
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:30,879
now this is something that evan mogul

821
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:32,480
talked about in 2011 on this stage and

822
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:33,679
in 2013

823
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:35,600
and he was good enough to send me a

824
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:36,080
little update video uh of where they've

825
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:39,199
got to

826
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:39,199
so let's see if that will play

827
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:45,200
is that spinner a good thing or a bad

828
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:48,840
thing thank you to steve for

829
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:52,320
inviting me to comment on

830
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:53,120
our uh earlier experiences together at

831
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:56,480
foster

832
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:58,239
which from 2011 were about the freedom

833
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:01,120
box procedure

834
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:05,070
freedom box is very dear to my heart as

835
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:06,879
it was

836
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:09,120
[Music]

837
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:11,519
because it is now time for us in the

838
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:14,799
free software movement to face

839
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:17,760
the reality we have been afraid of all

840
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:19,679
our lives we came to work on free

841
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:22,000
software because we believed

842
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:24,399
that technological freedom was

843
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,360
absolutely necessary to the survival of

844
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:28,080
civil liberty

845
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:29,600
all around the world we thought that

846
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:31,678
computers that didn't work

847
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:33,279
for their users that their users

848
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:35,360
couldn't understand

849
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:36,720
couldn't change couldn't fix and

850
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:38,639
couldn't share

851
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:40,320
would be computers that would eliminate

852
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:43,760
the possibility of freedom

853
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:46,399
and unfortunately we were right now

854
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:48,158
after a generation after all these years

855
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:50,158
together it fostered them after all

856
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:52,559
these decades of work

857
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:54,720
we are in the place in which if we can't

858
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:57,600
deliver freedom to people

859
00:31:54,720 --> 00:32:00,320
using free software we cannot be sure

860
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:02,879
that liberty will survive

861
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:03,519
that was why i started the freedom box

862
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:06,799
project

863
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:08,960
to see if we could use the smallest

864
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:11,918
cheapest computers available in the

865
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:14,320
world to deliver real freedom respecting

866
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:18,640
services to everybody

867
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:21,600
now after all these years we are ready

868
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:22,320
this a freedom box manufactured under

869
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:25,918
licensed

870
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:28,639
by olimex in bulgaria is the first

871
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:29,840
commercial product using our wonderful

872
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:33,039
free software

873
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:35,600
to deliver freedom we can also run

874
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:36,799
in everything from an orange pie to a

875
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:40,399
raspberry pi

876
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:42,158
to an arduino board to a a virtual

877
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:45,120
instance in the aws

878
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:47,039
cloud all of this happened because

879
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:50,719
people who were together with us

880
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:51,840
in brussels saw the importance of this

881
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:53,840
vision

882
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:55,199
because free software programmers from

883
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:58,158
around the world now

884
00:32:55,200 --> 00:33:00,080
want to deliver freedom to users

885
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:00,640
everywhere to their families their

886
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:03,600
friends

887
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:04,480
and their communities this is what

888
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:07,439
fosdem

889
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:08,640
is about this is what freedom box is

890
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:11,039
about

891
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:11,840
this is the life we have lived together

892
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:15,039
and for which

893
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:18,480
i am so very grateful thank you

894
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:20,799
to fosdem thank you to steve

895
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:22,480
thank you to those who believe in

896
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:25,320
freedom

897
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:28,540
thanks to evan

898
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:28,540
[Music]

899
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:35,760
so of course it wouldn't be fosdem if it

900
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:37,360
wasn't in brussels i guess

901
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:39,679
and that's kind of helped because in the

902
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:40,799
same way that fosdem was able to get his

903
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:43,039
first speakers

904
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:45,039
by shall we say borrowing some from the

905
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:47,279
paris linux conference

906
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:49,600
other conferences have started up around

907
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:51,440
fosdem at around the time

908
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,959
pg day for example has been going quite

909
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:56,080
a few years now

910
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:58,399
to coincide with fosdem

911
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:59,840
uh look um there was a git thing last

912
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:02,639
year that was that

913
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:03,360
um and also java has their committers

914
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,840
workshop

915
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:07,678
around this sort of time as well i

916
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:09,679
believe which has really helped because

917
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:10,800
it's kind of worked in the same way that

918
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:12,560
servers have worked

919
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:16,240
we start with the monolith which is

920
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:18,159
fosdem and then we create microservices

921
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:19,520
those are the difference and then its

922
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:20,800
function as a service which are the

923
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:22,000
lightning talks the births of the

924
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:24,000
feather talks

925
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,280
and then those reaching out to other

926
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,760
conferences they create

927
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:30,879
outside of the fosdem tracks now known

928
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:30,879
as the fosdem fringe

929
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:35,599
but of course i'm saying it's not all

930
00:34:32,839 --> 00:34:37,359
work and we do try it and pretend to

931
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:39,599
have some fun

932
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:42,000
there is this misconception that geeks

933
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:44,320
don't socialize

934
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,760
that is not true anyone that's been in

935
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:49,359
the delirium on friday night

936
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:50,800
knows that's not true the only thing

937
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:52,319
that might be considered true

938
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:54,480
is that we don't want to socialize with

939
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:56,320
people like that

940
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:58,240
people that thinks oh you're a bit geeky

941
00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:01,040
we don't like you

942
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:02,720
we socialize and these are the only

943
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:07,359
clean pictures i'm allowed to use

944
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:08,720
so this is what we had back in 2001-2002

945
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:10,560
i'm showing this for one particular

946
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:13,839
reason there's no

947
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:16,640
camera on that camera phone yes

948
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:17,920
they did exist phones without a camera

949
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:20,720
meant we could get away with a lot of

950
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:22,320
stuff that we probably couldn't now

951
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:23,520
the other problem with this it means

952
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,160
people had to take their rather

953
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:26,160
expensive

954
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:27,598
slr cameras into pubs if we wanted to

955
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:29,200
get any pictures

956
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:31,119
luckily some people were brave enough to

957
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:33,359
take their nice

958
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:34,960
phones in nice cameras into pubs and

959
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:37,839
this is one of them

960
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:38,480
uh this is in the right espana on grand

961
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:40,320
place

962
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:42,000
this is where we had the first number of

963
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:44,000
friday night beer events

964
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,240
as you can see there's actually space in

965
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,240
there

966
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:52,800
probably room for a few more people

967
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:54,160
around that table and also we have seats

968
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:56,240
and also in this particular place

969
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:57,598
because there weren't that many of us

970
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:59,279
the bartenders would come around they'd

971
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:00,480
take our drinks order and at the end of

972
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:03,599
the night they'd say

973
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:05,280
what did you drink now i don't know if

974
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:08,800
these bartenders have ever experienced

975
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:08,800
people having alcohol before

976
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:12,079
but asking someone what have you drunk

977
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:15,040
it's like

978
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:16,480
well just two pints of shandy me mate

979
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:17,680
it's not gonna cut it

980
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:20,000
particularly when some of my friends

981
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:21,118
don't drink at all so when you get to

982
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:27,040
the end of the night and they just say

983
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:28,960
i had two coca-colas i go no you didn't

984
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:31,200
luckily i'm proud to say that after many

985
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:32,800
years of doing this i now understand how

986
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:34,560
strong belgian beer is

987
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:36,400
and how many i can have before i need to

988
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:40,560
leave delirium in order to get in for

989
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:41,599
the saturday keynote there's also

990
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:43,279
parties and

991
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:45,599
dinners going on most most of the

992
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:47,440
evenings uh saturday as usual

993
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:49,280
uh particularly for us a lot again

994
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:50,960
that's me with more hair

995
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:53,040
uh and this is where you know a lot of

996
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:53,680
the stories and a lot of the real things

997
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:55,119
come out

998
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:57,118
the information that you don't hear on

999
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:59,200
the tracks um and

1000
00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:00,480
i think i'm allowed to tell this story

1001
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:03,359
um

1002
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:04,079
at a table once and there's about seven

1003
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:06,560
or eight of us

1004
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:09,119
all there and one person is complaining

1005
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:11,680
about how hard it is to compile kde

1006
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:13,359
and how hard it is to package kde not

1007
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:17,200
realizing that the person who compiled

1008
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:17,200
and packaged kde was sat next to them

1009
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:22,320
mansplaining was not invented recently

1010
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:23,760
we've been doing it for years

1011
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:26,240
it's also in the same restaurant

1012
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:27,839
actually um we were sat around we

1013
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:28,959
thought let's get a picture

1014
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:31,119
and where's the waitress could you take

1015
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,920
a picture and give the camera he says

1016
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:34,560
okay everybody

1017
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:36,000
say cheese so what do you think every

1018
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:38,240
single geek at that table did

1019
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,359
in unison thinking it would be a funny

1020
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:42,479
joke

1021
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:46,000
they said formage

1022
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:46,000
the only french they obviously know

1023
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:49,599
and even more dinners again it's one of

1024
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:51,040
those things that you never know who

1025
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:51,440
you're going to end up getting sat next

1026
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:54,000
to

1027
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:56,160
and talking to at these sort of events

1028
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,520
i've um

1029
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:59,279
i've probably got that very wrong

1030
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:01,119
created by sat next to me

1031
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:03,119
one night to dinner phil hazel from x in

1032
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:04,160
fame so next opposite me another night

1033
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:06,320
at dinner

1034
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:07,598
this is not me bragging by the way this

1035
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:09,200
is normal

1036
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:12,720
this happened pretty much every night to

1037
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:14,160
somebody during the course of fosdem

1038
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:15,520
and the city tours are a comparatively

1039
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:16,799
recent thing i could never quite find

1040
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:20,160
out when they started

1041
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:21,760
but now the partners of us lot have the

1042
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:23,920
option of going out to get a free city

1043
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:25,920
tour so they can see brussels

1044
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:27,200
oh you know it's a nice thing to do i

1045
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:28,240
don't know if that means more people are

1046
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:30,240
going to do it next year because i've

1047
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:31,680
told you all it exists

1048
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:34,399
but it's it's a thing that's been laid

1049
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:36,640
on and it was always for partners

1050
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:39,440
never for wives and girlfriends so

1051
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:42,319
occasionally we get things right

1052
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:43,599
except for this thing beer map buckaroo

1053
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:45,200
there are probably people in this room

1054
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:49,119
that have played it

1055
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:49,118
i i know at least where two of them are

1056
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:54,000
i'm not going to ask for show of hands

1057
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:55,598
but beer met buckaroo

1058
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,240
it's a game to be played late at night

1059
00:38:55,599 --> 00:39:00,000
in the bars of breath of brussels

1060
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:01,520
fourth time's quite a long concert uh

1061
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,760
conference quite grueling you're up

1062
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:06,240
quite early you're out quite late

1063
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:07,520
so even when you sat in a rock club in

1064
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:09,520
the middle of brussels

1065
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:12,800
you've been up for 12 hours you're a bit

1066
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:14,800
tired you may fall asleep

1067
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:17,040
it is the responsibility of other people

1068
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:19,920
with you to place beer mats on your head

1069
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:19,920
one at a time

1070
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:26,720
one beer map per person whoever puts the

1071
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:27,440
beer mat on the head when that person

1072
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:31,040
wakes up

1073
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:31,040
loses and buys the next round

1074
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:36,400
there are no real winners in this except

1075
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:42,400
for that paul sapp who's

1076
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:45,119
oh wait that's me

1077
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:46,960
so what is it like today well we've

1078
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:49,359
looked a lot of the history

1079
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:50,000
so what sort of numbers have we got here

1080
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:52,400
and

1081
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,440
i wrote a short script that would go

1082
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:55,040
through

1083
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:56,720
the history of the conference but before

1084
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:58,640
i take you through that

1085
00:39:56,720 --> 00:40:00,160
i'm just going to do a one-minute thing

1086
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:02,240
walking over here

1087
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:03,759
because 20 years is quite literally a

1088
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:06,720
long time

1089
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:08,079
it is a generation and in the same way

1090
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:10,078
that lots of people have come into our

1091
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:12,079
lives over the last 20 years

1092
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:13,680
we've also lost a lot as well and these

1093
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:15,440
are not the only people

1094
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:16,879
we've all lost someone at some point in

1095
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:20,800
that time

1096
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:20,800
and it's unfortunately inevitable

1097
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:25,839
but there we have it so

1098
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:31,119
moving on let's get down to some good

1099
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:32,960
old serious mucking about

1100
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:34,400
and all these stats will have caveats

1101
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:36,319
attached to them

1102
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:38,319
as i say i have gone through all the old

1103
00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:40,960
websites and did a copy and paste

1104
00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:42,240
of them so i might have missed things

1105
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:43,200
there may be names which i've got

1106
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:45,520
incorrect

1107
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:46,640
but as i say it's on github so if i made

1108
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:49,359
a typo

1109
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:50,640
i do accept pull requests we might

1110
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:51,200
eventually get a full record of

1111
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:54,400
everything

1112
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:55,040
that happened at fosdem so in just this

1113
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:58,560
year

1114
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:59,520
we've had 817 talks by 781 different

1115
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:01,440
speakers

1116
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:02,960
every year up and to the right up and to

1117
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:05,599
the right always increasing

1118
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:07,119
always steadily now obviously this

1119
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:10,079
number is kind of contentious

1120
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:11,760
you know we say 817 talks should we

1121
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:12,240
include the beginning talks and the end

1122
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:15,839
talks

1123
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:17,919
should we include lpi exams and

1124
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:19,520
that sort of thing so you know you could

1125
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:20,079
vary this by a few but this gives you a

1126
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:23,040
rough idea

1127
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:25,680
of the scale of which we're speaking

1128
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:27,119
there are 55 difference

1129
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:30,000
as you see the number of death rooms

1130
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:32,240
increases as does the number of talks

1131
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,599
in fact if you were to go and listen to

1132
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:38,240
every single talk

1133
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:39,680
that's happened over just this weekend

1134
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:42,479
if my memory serves it will take you

1135
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:44,720
nine and a half weeks

1136
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:46,240
every day eight hours a day including

1137
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:50,799
saturdays and sundays

1138
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:52,319
to get through everything for just this

1139
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:54,560
now you might play that up over the last

1140
00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:57,680
20 years if you wanted to

1141
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:57,680
catch up with fosdem

1142
00:41:58,319 --> 00:42:03,839
you know the fosdem binge watch channel

1143
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:03,839
would last you until august

1144
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:11,520
these are the speakers speaking this

1145
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:12,720
weekend

1146
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:14,240
well no that's technically that's a

1147
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:15,359
picture of the speakers who are speaking

1148
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,560
this weekend

1149
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:18,720
and if you squint hard enough you can

1150
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:21,119
just about make out the fosdem logo in

1151
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:22,799
amongst all of that

1152
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:24,720
as far as i know everyone is included my

1153
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:26,079
apologies if i managed to miss someone

1154
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:30,720
you know because there was a late change

1155
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:33,359
or something like that

1156
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:34,720
if we accumulate all of these numbers

1157
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:37,200
what sort of totals do you think we're

1158
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:37,200
going to get

1159
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:41,119
well let's start with the number of

1160
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:44,560
talks in total

1161
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:46,720
since started seven thousand

1162
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:50,240
two hundred and eighty one that is

1163
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:50,240
pretty much an inconceivable number

1164
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:56,800
four thousand and one unique speakers

1165
00:42:56,839 --> 00:43:04,000
unique that's more people than attended

1166
00:43:00,319 --> 00:43:04,000
the first four fosdems put together

1167
00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:12,160
and 149 different dev rooms

1168
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:13,359
now i think i've got rid of all the you

1169
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:15,200
know the typos in there

1170
00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:16,799
and you know and embedded was embedded

1171
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:19,118
and embedded in automotive

1172
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:21,200
and and so forth uh same dev room had

1173
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:22,640
several titles during its lifetime

1174
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:24,799
the graphics dev room used to be the

1175
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:28,000
exog dev room i believe

1176
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:29,119
but still 149 different subjects in open

1177
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,720
source

1178
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:32,560
which is not surprising it's a big

1179
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:34,160
industry and

1180
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:35,680
you realize this when you walk out if

1181
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:37,118
you ever give a talk and you really

1182
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:39,520
should

1183
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:41,280
if you give a talk and you walk out the

1184
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:43,280
strangest thing happens

1185
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:44,640
you're in the room you're looking at 100

1186
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:48,000
200 people

1187
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:49,520
in this case 2 000 people right now i

1188
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:52,480
feel like the most important person in

1189
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:54,000
open source that there is

1190
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:56,000
that's not the laugh i'll tell you when

1191
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,520
i'm doing the funnies okay when i but

1192
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:00,000
when i walk out that door

1193
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:00,800
i am nobody everyone else is more famous

1194
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,400
than i am

1195
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:04,800
everyone else has done more been on

1196
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:06,640
better projects more involved projects

1197
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:08,240
because no matter how big your project

1198
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:09,359
is there's always another one that's

1199
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:13,118
bigger

1200
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:14,960
or more impressive and this is the dev

1201
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:23,839
room totals

1202
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:23,839
mozilla well done you win

1203
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:30,480
hard luck embedded you kind of forgot

1204
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:32,880
that one so you've been caught up well

1205
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:34,000
but as you see the dev rooms are quite a

1206
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:35,920
flowing thing

1207
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,359
sometimes we have a lot of dev rooms at

1208
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:38,960
the start and like gnome

1209
00:44:37,359 --> 00:44:40,480
and then afterwards it's like dead

1210
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:42,079
room's not needed anymore

1211
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:43,599
and the space is taken up by other

1212
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:45,599
things like software defined radio i

1213
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:48,720
didn't even know that was a thing

1214
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:51,680
until i saw it at first then

1215
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:52,480
and there's a lot of good stories from

1216
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:56,000
these things i think

1217
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:57,359
probably the biggest story is java

1218
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,280
now originally there was a project

1219
00:44:57,359 --> 00:45:04,240
called gnu class path

1220
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:05,359
anyone remember gnu class path yes uh

1221
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:06,720
and there were and there was

1222
00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:08,400
i think there was a free java and open

1223
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:08,799
java and about seven or eight different

1224
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:11,040
java

1225
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:12,400
type projects trying to do the open

1226
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:14,880
version

1227
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:16,560
well it turned out that someone managed

1228
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:19,359
to persuade sun

1229
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:21,920
to open source their java and the people

1230
00:45:19,359 --> 00:45:24,799
that did it did it at fosdem

1231
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:26,480
so the reason we have open java and the

1232
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:29,839
reason

1233
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:31,520
is fosdem which unfortunately means

1234
00:45:29,839 --> 00:45:33,839
larry didn't get to buy a yacht that

1235
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:35,759
year

1236
00:45:33,839 --> 00:45:38,078
but i'm happy to trade larry's job for

1237
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:41,200
open java

1238
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:41,200
yes well done java

1239
00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:48,160
i'm sure we've got some of the java

1240
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:48,800
people in that are responsible for that

1241
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:51,200
as well so

1242
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:53,119
you should buy them a beer later so the

1243
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:55,919
total in word so i went through

1244
00:45:53,119 --> 00:45:57,680
every talk title for the last 20 years i

1245
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:59,280
removed the ands and the obs and the

1246
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:02,799
knots and all those sort of tiny words

1247
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:04,400
and i built this now you've got all the

1248
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:05,680
obvious words in there

1249
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:07,520
you know like open and source and

1250
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:09,200
software and community but there are

1251
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:12,800
also two words in there that kind of

1252
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:15,520
stuck out to me um and that was fun

1253
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:16,960
and the word profit so i was very

1254
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:18,640
curious on how i could make a profit

1255
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:20,079
with this open source

1256
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:21,759
but it turns out there were about eight

1257
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:24,400
or nine talks all labelled

1258
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:26,480
come and do this for fun and profit go

1259
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:28,640
and do that for fun and profit

1260
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:29,520
every single time there's a full fun and

1261
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:31,279
profit talk

1262
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:33,599
you are required to keep this tradition

1263
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:33,599
going

1264
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:38,240
so in the conclusions it started small

1265
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:41,359
very small

1266
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:42,319
incredibly hopelessly small and built up

1267
00:46:41,359 --> 00:46:44,400
gradually

1268
00:46:42,319 --> 00:46:46,400
small blocks that way there could never

1269
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:48,640
be too many surprises same as in code

1270
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:49,920
make one change at a time then you know

1271
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:52,078
where the breakage is

1272
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:53,280
small things added continually always

1273
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:54,240
something new always something else

1274
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:56,079
happening

1275
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:58,479
that ethos thing has not changed free is

1276
00:46:56,079 --> 00:47:00,000
still good free is still here

1277
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:01,920
death rooms do seem to be the biggest

1278
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,359
draw now but as i say

1279
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:05,520
there are fringe events which keep

1280
00:47:03,359 --> 00:47:07,680
cropping up every single year

1281
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:09,599
i mean nowadays we've got what's as i

1282
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:12,640
say 700 talks here

1283
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:14,800
going on at any one time this year

1284
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:17,598
there were more talks than there were in

1285
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:18,880
the entirety of the first fosdem

1286
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:20,720
basically you could take the first four

1287
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:21,440
stem and run it in the morning session

1288
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:22,839
on saturday

1289
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:25,839
and we could all be in the pub by

1290
00:47:22,839 --> 00:47:25,839
lunchtime

1291
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:31,440
so what happens now how do i predict the

1292
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:34,078
future what is fostering going to be

1293
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:35,520
doing over the next 20 years

1294
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:36,800
well i can tell you exactly what foster

1295
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:37,920
is going to be doing oh no so i've run

1296
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:39,040
out of time so i can't tell you what

1297
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:40,559
fosdem is going to be doing over the

1298
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:43,440
next 20 years

1299
00:47:40,559 --> 00:47:44,800
but it's all down to whatever you say

1300
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:48,800
whatever we say it's

1301
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:50,960
our confidence it's open it's for us

1302
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:53,119
so i i will uh finish my slide by

1303
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:56,160
updating my scorecard

1304
00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:58,160
ding there we go and normally i would

1305
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:59,520
finish on a slide of any questions

1306
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:01,118
but as i said at the beginning i'm not

1307
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:02,240
an organizer i'm not volunteer i just

1308
00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:04,319
turn up

1309
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:05,439
so instead of any questions i'm going to

1310
00:48:04,319 --> 00:48:09,040
phrase it

1311
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:10,480
any answers because you can contact me

00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:25,040
and they're going to be up here saying

1320
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:26,000
how has free software helped and saved

1321
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:27,279
the world

1322
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:29,040
and it will be because of someone in

1323
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:31,520
this audience and

1324
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:32,800
some of the projects that are based here

1325

so with that i'll say thank you for your

1326

it's been big also the biggest audience

1328
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:39,599
