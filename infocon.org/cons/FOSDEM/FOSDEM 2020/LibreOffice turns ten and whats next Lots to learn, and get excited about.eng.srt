please

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,080
turn off your mobile phones

3
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:20,320
hello yeah okay okay

4
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:21,039
let me introduce you michael mix and his

5
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:25,439
talk is

6
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:28,960
libreoffice turns 10 and what's next

7
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:30,400
police after michael finished his

8
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:33,200
presentation uh

9
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,079
don't run away and wait until uh

10
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,840
question session

11
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:39,520
end thank you michael

12
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,960
thank you very much excellent so you

13
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,719
know

14
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,079
i'd love to encourage you to all move

15
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,160
closer and enjoy the

16
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:47,520
the proximity of being next to each

17
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,519
other in this this lovely

18
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,559
tutorial but perhaps not this time

19
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,719
anyway

20
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:53,919
um so say this is what i'm going to talk

21
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:57,360
about so i won't

22
00:00:53,920 --> 00:01:00,800
uh tell you about that um here we go

23
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:02,960
so 10 years 10 years or 20 years

24
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,239
amusingly uh libreoffice has been uh

25
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,000
growing in in

26
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:07,520
conjunction with fosdem for 20 years and

27
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,479
so we're very just thrilled

28
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:11,360
to be able to celebrate our 10th or 20th

29
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:14,400
depending how you look at it

30
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:15,520
or 35th anniversary at the same time

31
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,720
that fosdem is so

32
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:22,600
just fantastic and um yeah

33
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:24,479
was it i'm sorry 45 35 it's a long time

34
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:28,000
1985.

35
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:30,079
yeah 35 years i'm saying marker buddhist

36
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,280
a wonderful guy a teenager working in

37
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:33,360
his garage

38
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,640
you have to be careful about garages you

39
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,799
know don't go in

40
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,079
you may come out with an office suite

41
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:40,320
you know um

42
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:41,360
so so he releases this and at this stage

43
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,798
in um

44
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,560
this this time it's really just a word

45
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:46,320
processor star writer

46
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,399
but it gets the dibs you know it beats

47
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,880
microsoft office by you know nearly five

48
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,960
years

49
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,720
so that's so that's all good this is the

50
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:55,039
93 version

51
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,479
and uh just a word processor and you

52
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,439
need to understand the world at this

53
00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:00,560
time

54
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:01,199
um all sorts of interesting things are

55
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,119
happening

56
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,560
uh so a spreadsheet was created which

57
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:06,399
was called quattro pro

58
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,160
i don't know if you know why um but

59
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:08,959
lotus created something called one two

60
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,478
three

61
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:12,000
and so borland created something called

62
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:13,680
four um

63
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,840
which was you know it was a friendly

64
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,000
time um and we lived in a diverse

65
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:21,040
industry not dominated by one monopoly

66
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,959
which was fantastic um and at this point

67
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,879
uh lotus was suing borland about the

68
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:26,720
structure sequence and organization of

69
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:28,160
uh menu so you know not nothing like

70
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,720
today obviously

71
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:32,160
um and and anyway so these are some

72
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,480
great quotes from philip khan the ball

73
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,720
and

74
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:36,238
co-founder you know prehistoric anything

75
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,080
20 years old and over

76
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:40,560
i don't know if any of you are over 20

77
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,080
but i am and uh it's good to it's good

78
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,200
to know that the facelift isn't going to

79
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,280
do it you know

80
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,238
um but but philly was particularly

81
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,239
interested

82
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:50,319
and a good exemplar of the the

83
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:52,319
excitement at the time about

84
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:53,280
revolutionary programming language

85
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:56,319
change

86
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,920
you know object orientation would make

87
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:59,760
everything wonderful

88
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,200
everything would be 10 times quicker and

89
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,200
and more beautiful

90
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,319
you know we would develop so amazingly

91
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,399
rapidly

92
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:07,920
software would become easy to read easy

93
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,360
to to handle

94
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,040
um it was absolutely amazing and

95
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,640
philippe told

96
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,239
so many people this you even get the new

97
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,399
york times

98
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:18,480
explaining um you know this this radical

99
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,920
new uh innovation you know so here are

100
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,238
some great great quotes from him

101
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,200
um creating the initial objects is

102
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:25,599
difficult

103
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,119
uh especially for programmers and so you

104
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:28,879
can you can see some of the pascal

105
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,480
programmers that came into open office

106
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:32,399
in the time or star office

107
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,679
and did the one big class approach you

108
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,840
know yeah

109
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,519
sure it's obj orientated why not one

110
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,040
class with a thousand methods that does

111
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:40,799
does everything but ultimately the

112
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:43,200
payoff will be faster

113
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,959
less costly development of new programs

114
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,720
and updates wonderful

115
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:49,519
mr gates has an interesting quote in the

116
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:51,599
same article if it's so great

117
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:52,720
why are their products so late well i

118
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,439
think that's uh that's a really great

119
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,159
question

120
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:57,519
um careful of panaceas anyway back at

121
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:00,480
this time marco is is

122
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:01,680
is i guess uh in this era of excitement

123
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:04,238
around objected

124
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,239
programming and so he creates a visual

125
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:07,120
class libraries a new way of creating

126
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:08,959
toolkits

127
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,879
that will make applications trivial to

128
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:12,560
write um

129
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:14,000
and so well he tries to sell this

130
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,840
toolkit but the demo apps

131
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,680
it turns out are the thing that most

132
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,440
interests people you know he creates

133
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:22,079
these office apps and and actually in

134
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:24,240
the end he then ends up refactoring uh

135
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,680
and creating these these uh office

136
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,680
productivity suite

137
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,440
out of his uh his visual class library

138
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,960
project which is brilliant i think these

139
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,719
days they call this a pivot

140
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,320
um you know there's a posh term for it

141
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,160
but absolutely brilliant

142
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:38,159
so he he went back to the the office

143
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,840
business he created star office three

144
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,880
which completely rewrote this so he even

145
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:45,039
ran on os2 which is fantastic and spark

146
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:47,440
and yeah directly competed with windows

147
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,639
on the office 95 as it were

148
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:51,040
and this is the code we're built on

149
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:55,280
today it's uh it's still the skeleton

150
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:58,160
of of that some of that design

151
00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:00,080
and why is that interesting well it

152
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:02,080
turns out that object orientation is not

153
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,359
a panacea

154
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,800
and it's it's a different way of

155
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,080
arranging your code and your data and

156
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,960
that's good you know there are many

157
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:10,639
benefits to it but

158
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,320
the problem is when you sit down and you

159
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:14,320
design your object hierarchy based on

160
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:16,240
what you see

161
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,599
you don't necessarily get a very good

162
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,199
design so you see

163
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,199
cells in spreadsheets so well that has

164
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,160
to be an object everything i can see

165
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,479
should have an object

166
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,759
you know yeah yeah that's not

167
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:27,359
necessarily a good idea

168
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:29,280
you know small talk popularize this

169
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,400
approach i guess you know every integer

170
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:34,080
should be an object

171
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:36,560
um but well anyway um say paragraphs

172
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:38,080
tables should be objects um the problem

173
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,960
is that this really screws up change

174
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,960
tracking

175
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,159
um so it was really very well understood

176
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,239
how to create good

177
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,440
office suites uh back in the day when

178
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,520
these decisions were made

179
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,600
and almost none of these insights were

180
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:51,359
taken into account

181
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,280
another cool thing about object

182
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,639
orientation of course is encapsulation

183
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,919
of information

184
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:57,840
so wouldn't it be nice if your file

185
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:59,680
format just serialized all these objects

186
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:02,880
and they stored their internal state

187
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:05,440
and all would be well oh dear

188
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,560
well roll on 20 years and some of those

189
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,240
initial object

190
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,600
hierarchy decisions turn out not to have

191
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,919
been the best ones

192
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,520
and the problem is when your file format

193
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:15,599
is essentially a serialization of your

194
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,758
object hierarchy

195
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,520
you have a real problem so what was done

196
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:20,000
was copying and pasting the whole office

197
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,599
suite

198
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,919
at the point that it could generate xml

199
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,840
files into a duplicate office suite

200
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:28,318
which we call the bin filter

201
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:30,239
and this kept the old object hierarchy

202
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:33,360
loaded your file saved it as a

203
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:35,759
as odf reloaded it as odf into the main

204
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,400
office suite and we finally managed to

205
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:39,360
get rid of this

206
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,719
you know like uh five years ago which is

207
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,400
which is quite good going

208
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,919
and this then freed us up to you know

209
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,359
undo some of these these stupid things

210
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:46,880
so spreadsheets for example

211
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,759
you know massive refactorings of the

212
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:52,000
core there totally restructured the data

213
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:53,039
a cell is not an object it's it's a set

214
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,919
of you know

215
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:57,759
complex uh data structures that describe

216
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:59,359
styles and formatting and

217
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:01,039
um you know and if it's got a number in

218
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:03,280
it if you have a column full of doubles

219
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:04,800
it is a root a contiguous span of

220
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:07,119
doubles if you want to sum them

221
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,720
you can do ssc optimize some you can

222
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,479
parallelize this you can deal with the

223
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,919
data in a meaningful way

224
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:13,840
and that's simply not possible with the

225
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:15,359
object approach um

226
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,198
and similarly writer you know the

227
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,479
problems of trying to do change tracking

228
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:20,800
with tables and

229
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:21,919
all of these different objects just

230
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,160
incredibly

231
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:26,000
problematic incredibly problematic and

232
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,199
so michael stahl for tip has been doing

233
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,520
some great great work there

234
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:31,039
shipping now too to try and turn this

235
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,440
into a view state so previously when you

236
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:33,440
pressed

237
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:35,520
when you pressed a key um it would

238
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:37,680
actually mutate the model

239
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,120
to what it thought it should be and then

240
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,199
put the key in and then mutate it

241
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,240
again um so if you weren't showing

242
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:43,759
change checking it would actually

243
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,319
literally edit all of your redlining in

244
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:49,360
and out of the document every keystroke

245
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:51,520
which is kind of uncool um anyway

246
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,479
so so open office so how did this happen

247
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,639
well

248
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:55,758
um this is the heady days of floss being

249
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:57,599
the panacea you know

250
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:59,840
open source will fix everything it's

251
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:00,878
fantastic and i i'm a big free software

252
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:03,280
lover myself so

253
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:04,720
you know but you know i think larry

254
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,318
ellison says you know open source is

255
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,440
going to kill proprietary software you

256
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,280
know um

257
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,479
you know the mini computer will kill the

258
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:14,400
mainframe

259
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:16,159
you know larry who's not a man i

260
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,599
approve of generally but but he says you

261
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,680
know he's been in this industry a long

262
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:21,840
time and watching the mainframe die

263
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,599
is like watching a glacier melt you know

264
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:25,679
even with global warming it's

265
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:26,960
it's going slowly you know there's still

266
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,840
still there anyway but

267
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:31,198
so so you know floss our mission is to

268
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,679
drive floss and make it uh rule the

269
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:33,680
worlds

270
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,360
but uh we need to think about ways to

271
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:37,598
speed that up

272
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,880
so yeah so anyway somebody start a

273
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:40,159
vision for less than the cost of the

274
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:43,760
licenses it was paying

275
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:45,680
uh reputedly and uh market is then a vp

276
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:47,839
of whatever and he opens sources star

277
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:50,719
office which is absolutely fantastic

278
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:52,080
and a really good a good thing to do i

279
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,600
mean so he did this talking to miguel

280
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,560
and nats who were doing a lot of gnome

281
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,720
stuff at ximen

282
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,760
are working on evolution male client

283
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,120
stuff and so actually some kind of

284
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,120
compromise whereby

285
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,720
gnome kind of de-emphasized its office

286
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,560
suite and they

287
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,080
got rid of their male clients and life

288
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,880
was happy we all

289
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:10,240
worked together in a glorious new world

290
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,959
unfortunately

291
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,399
in terms of attracting developers um the

292
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:16,239
guy who wrote the build instructions for

293
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:18,080
open office was a non-developer who

294
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,839
apparently hadn't done the job

295
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,440
um you know he just cargo culted some

296
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:22,080
rumors he'd heard from from here and

297
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,120
there

298
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,200
and when they came to attracting

299
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:27,200
developers you know the the the goal of

300
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,480
a dependency graph of open office was to

301
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,839
terrify you

302
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,080
uh rather than to try and teach you

303
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:34,000
anything it seems you know um so

304
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,600
actually it's not really that difficult

305
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,040
you know i mean like get this complexity

306
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,200
there's eight million lines of code

307
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,319
but it's not it's not the madness that

308
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,920
you can try and make it

309
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,440
look like if you really if you really go

310
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:45,040
for it

311
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,720
another fun thing about openoffice was

312
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,640
the development process

313
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,160
so so inside the team of you know i

314
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,640
don't know 100 developers there was a

315
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,560
great

316
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,240
development methodology which was this

317
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:57,119
um you could do something

318
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,560
fun you know in your base library uh you

319
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,120
could rename a method

320
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,640
for no apparent reason or or or change

321
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,800
the order of parameters or

322
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:06,319
or something like that and then you

323
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,839
would simply send an email to all of

324
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,240
your colleagues saying

325
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:11,519
well i did this please go and fix your

326
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:14,079
code

327
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:15,120
um before moving on to doing another

328
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:17,439
similar you know

329
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,320
thing and and and the problem with this

330
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,000
of course is that

331
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,440
you know the code never actually builds

332
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,839
of course you commit your code as well

333
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,920
right so

334
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:25,200
your code goes in your and everyone else

335
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:28,560
has to um

336
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:31,360
to try and catch up and um

337
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:32,959
yeah unfortunately platform and api

338
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,720
churn rapidly

339
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:36,479
overwhelms the ability of any anyone to

340
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,519
do actually anything up here because

341
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,480
it's all

342
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:41,760
breaking down there and yes of course

343
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,279
there's a panacea to fix that just

344
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,160
rewrite it all in another language and

345
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:46,480
then you know

346
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,680
um so the build tree was in a permanent

347
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,040
state of brokenness

348
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,880
i mean so they had release engineers

349
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,360
whose job was effectively to branch the

350
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,680
tree

351
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,120
every two weeks or as soon as they could

352
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,880
actually build it it usually took

353
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,480
that sort of time and and then they

354
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:01,040
would try and include all the fixes that

355
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,480
would actually make it build

356
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,560
and at the end of this they would do you

357
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,519
know many a day or two of building on

358
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,959
cpu time

359
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:08,399
and then they give everyone binaries

360
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:09,439
that they could build on top of for

361
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:12,480
their next

362
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:15,440
extravaganza of api change and

363
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:17,279
an improvement i'm saying so one of the

364
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,800
corollaries of this is the top commit

365
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:19,360
count people in the world if you look in

366
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,880
olo

367
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,720
are the release engineers that merged

368
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,120
everyone else's patches they they're

369
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,320
just

370
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:28,800
you know they're just outstanding um

371
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,560
see just to to reflect on this this

372
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,560
sounds like a ridiculous situation where

373
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:35,518
the people who maintain the platform

374
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:37,199
can rabidly change it and break everyone

375
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:38,800
that works on top of it

376
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:41,120
that's a mad way to develop software

377
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,120
isn't it

378
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:46,079
well welcome to linux fantastic

379
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:48,239
you know everybody in the base system

380
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:49,599
has brilliant ideas for improving uh

381
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,519
things at the bottom

382
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,120
um and the great news is that everybody

383
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:54,000
that builds on top of them gets to live

384
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,959
with this

385
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,639
and uh you know so let me encourage you

386
00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:01,760
to keep your apis stable

387
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:04,399
and your apis stable and to to live

388
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:05,279
with the pain um because although

389
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:07,120
removing the

390
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:08,560
threaded the option of having threaded

391
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:11,279
users of your tool kit

392
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:12,880
seems like a nice cleanup that removes

393
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:16,800
20 or 30 lines

394
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:18,800
out of gtk just to pick an example

395
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:21,279
it totally screws libreoffice and

396
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:26,240
everyone ever wrote a macro potentially

397
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:26,240
so you know it might be nice to see this

398
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:38,079
nixon hello see the suffering you

399
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:40,560
inflict on others before you uh you know

400
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:42,000
do it i guess so anyway it took me a

401
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,359
month to get my first build i'm

402
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,240
obviously an idiot

403
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,839
um but um with with a whole lid of fixes

404
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,040
which i quickly upstreamed i managed to

405
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:51,200
get it to build

406
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,480
and you know you could then update it

407
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,800
and then it would break again

408
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,000
completely for weeks and there was never

409
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,199
anything that you could actually be sure

410
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,040
would actually work

411
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:01,120
so i created this thing called oo build

412
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,000
and based on frederick crozat's work and

413
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,920
suddenly

414
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,040
all the linux distributions used it

415
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,639
fantastic

416
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:09,680
and the good news was that you know a

417
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:12,000
day into your build of wall clock time

418
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,880
it was at least not intended to fail you

419
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,639
know like like

420
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,399
at least someone else had built it and

421
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:18,320
thought it should work um

422
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:19,600
which is kind of kind of good you know

423
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,000
build times have improved but we're

424
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,880
still

425
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,240
you know an hour a minimum and so

426
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:26,079
there's some serious strains there i

427
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,040
mean at the time i visited a conference

428
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:28,479
in the uk

429
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:30,160
and everywhere i went i found

430
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,440
frustration uh you know there were

431
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:33,839
people with holding up

432
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,560
placards like this and you know don't

433
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:36,399
mandate

434
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:38,079
incredibly burdensome process just to

435
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:40,399
fix uh simple

436
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:42,319
simple things i don't force people to

437
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:42,800
have a team that they have to join with

438
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,519
a

439
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:47,839
a product owner and a spec writer and a

440
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:50,000
ux designer and a qa person

441
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:50,880
why not just you know let things

442
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,160
actually uh

443
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:57,680
carry on um try and avoid the

444
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:59,360
bugs uh you know piling up and uh yes

445
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:01,760
actually fix some will be would be be

446
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,880
nice um contributor agreements well when

447
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,639
do you think fedora dropped the

448
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:07,199
requirement for a contributor agreement

449
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:07,680
that assigned copyright to a wonderful

450
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:10,880
company

451
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:12,638
uh red hat right um so you know don't

452
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,920
don't keep people out of the project uh

453
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:16,160
when you we don't need to

454
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:18,399
um it's very difficult if you're the

455
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:20,240
majority contributor not you know to to

456
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:21,760
include otherwise but uh libreoffice of

457
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:23,519
course you know

458
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:25,120
try try to fix this and then there's

459
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:25,920
just the cultural problems you know i

460
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,560
don't know if you know

461
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:30,000
people who are like this you know every

462
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,599
solution has a problem

463
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,000
uh that means you can't even think of

464
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,199
doing it and uh it gets a bit much after

465
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,160
a while

466
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:37,920
and and yeah i don't want to

467
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:39,199
mischaracterize the the starter vision

468
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,479
the really

469
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:41,680
you know many of these burdensome

470
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,760
process things were not just for the

471
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:45,680
community they were just like corporate

472
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,959
culture projected outside

473
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:49,359
and there were some real heroes there

474
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:50,319
that went so tried to make the community

475
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,480
a fun place to be

476
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:53,519
by doing the burdensome process

477
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,360
themselves

478
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:56,959
and they're just absolutely fantastic so

479
00:14:55,360 --> 00:15:00,800
uh you know but it was

480
00:14:56,959 --> 00:15:03,920
serious cultural uh problems here

481
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:05,359
uh so libra office well here we go so

482
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:07,199
during the libreoffice conference

483
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:09,600
uh in in budapest at the open office

484
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:11,199
conference uh we we managed to bundle

485
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,600
everyone else in the conference off on a

486
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:14,079
boat

487
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,199
on the river and had you been on the

488
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:16,479
boat you would have noticed that these

489
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:17,519
people weren't there they were at a

490
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:20,079
separate restaurant

491
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:21,040
a plotting uh and so by september the

492
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:23,680
second

493
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:25,120
we'd come up with a plan and had a nice

494
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:27,519
meal to boot

495
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:29,040
um and interestingly almost all of these

496
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:30,000
people are still involved in the project

497
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,199
today

498
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,959
which is fantastic some of the most

499
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:34,719
full-time staff or almost all of them

500
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:38,079
are still doing wonderful things

501
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:40,320
it's a testament how fun uh this can be

502
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:41,680
um but yeah so you see we had a we had a

503
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,279
good we had a good time there

504
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:45,758
and uh in less than a month we would

505
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:47,600
have released uh libreoffice

506
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:48,959
and of course um at this point you need

507
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,959
to call in all your favors when you're

508
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:53,199
starting a new risky

509
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:54,719
a risky project uh there are a lot of

510
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:55,279
people you've met at fosdem and

511
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,639
elsewhere

512
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:59,759
and programmed with that you have to go

513
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:01,440
and uh encourage to do something risky

514
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:03,120
um so so this was the the management

515
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,079
stack in red hat and this was susan

516
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:07,759
these are two main

517
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:09,439
external contributors to

518
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:11,519
uh and here's one of the i will i

519
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:13,519
anonymize the company that was having

520
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:15,440
having uh problems because frankly both

521
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:17,839
of them were you know it was really much

522
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,800
after you no no after you you know this

523
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:19,519
little thing is this going to be a

524
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,758
success

525
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:23,680
how can we tell when i'm when i'm you

526
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:24,959
know this guy at the top

527
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,638
and to be fair these these are really

528
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:28,399
cool guys you'll never have well maybe

529
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:31,199
you've not heard of many of these people

530
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:31,759
probably uh probably you should do um

531
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:33,920
but

532
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:36,560
you know the problem was that we'll do

533
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:39,360
it if google does

534
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,758
you know we we we want something to uh

535
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,040
you know

536
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:43,040
it's about exactly you know we had pr

537
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:44,800
agencies lined up corporate backing

538
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,560
you know and then red hat and caesar you

539
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,439
know backed back this extraordinarily uh

540
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,199
helpfully so

541
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:51,199
10 days to launch i sent an email like

542
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:52,880
this um

543
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:54,639
uh to chris christa boehner and uh

544
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,959
jeremy anderson who's he's here which is

545
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:58,639
cool

546
00:16:54,959 --> 00:17:01,199
at google saying you know quick

547
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:02,160
we need help uh please can you give us a

548
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:05,039
double rainy

549
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,678
rainbows and ponies uh you know uh sort

550
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:07,280
of thing or just

551
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:09,199
any kind of vague commitment that we can

552
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:10,559
use to uh to bounce this along

553
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:11,760
the bit the perhaps you missed here is

554
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:12,720
that much of the plotting was done

555
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,160
entirely without any

556
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,319
any backup and then you go and ask for

557
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:18,000
it uh you know when it's all on the edge

558
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:21,199
of course something real happening there

559
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,919
well ten days to launch i think this is

560
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:27,520
a good sign you know

561
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:30,400
um so yes seven days before launch

562
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:32,320
they come up trumps you know so uh so

563
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,760
yeah google is proud to be a supporter

564
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,559
of the document foundation which doesn't

565
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,000
exist yet

566
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:38,160
and it's run by a whole load of kids

567
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,880
right you know and participate in the

568
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,600
project

569
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,400
you know a resounding a resounding

570
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,559
endorsement

571
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:47,440
uh bingo unlocked everything so in terms

572
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:49,440
of getting people to line up and sign up

573
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:51,840
um this is this is uh just absolutely

574
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:54,080
wonderful and so you know i i think

575
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:55,840
yeah google play perhaps an unsung but

576
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:57,760
uh extraordinarily helpful

577
00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:00,159
a process of getting everybody on side

578
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:03,280
of doing that some kind of due diligence

579
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:06,559
over a beer you know in a community room

580
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:08,559
somewhere and making it making it fly

581
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:10,639
so yeah then we didn't have a logo well

582
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:11,280
so christoph noack is an awesome guy he

583
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,919
was one of the

584
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:14,879
early plotters as you can see and we

585
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:17,360
were playing around

586
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,400
with lots of different legos my friend

587
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:21,600
larry ewing uh

588
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:23,440
created tux actually a programmer um

589
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,559
not really a a designer he drew the tux

590
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,440
logo and then he wanted to draw the

591
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:27,600
simian logo

592
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,360
after we'd spent a fortune on outsourced

593
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,399
design agencies to try and make a logo

594
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,479
all of which sucked

595
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,919
and he's like oh i just you know like

596
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:37,039
anyway so it turns out

597
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:38,640
kristoff created this yeah

598
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:40,480
help me improve i'm not experiencing

599
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:42,000
graphics design you know

600
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,440
i know some but actually if you look at

601
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,919
wikipedia and you look at the logo

602
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,280
article

603
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:46,640
i think someone's got a sense of humor

604
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,440
there this is the example of the

605
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:50,240
minimalist

606
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:51,200
logo and ibm is next to it and you know

607
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,280
what can you do

608
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:55,360
it's it's it's a pretty cool and

609
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:56,720
visually distinct brand

610
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:58,639
and then of course you know we needed

611
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,280
build so everyone's panickingly creating

612
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,640
builds

613
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,000
uh synchronizing them to our mirror

614
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,720
brain network so we can cope with the

615
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,720
download

616
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:06,320
uh bandwidth so uh peter pummell created

617
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,840
that and was involved with this

618
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:09,760
getting the infrastructure set up the

619
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:11,678
git repository with a website in it late

620
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:14,879
at night craziness blah blah

621
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:17,200
bingo the 28th here it is

622
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,799
and so we have you know obvious liberal

623
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,640
office you know navel red hat

624
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:22,160
and lots of other people then come in

625
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,120
you know richard stallman and mark

626
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,120
shuttleworth

627
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,479
the osi simon is of course still

628
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:28,719
involved with the libreoffice

629
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:30,000
name neo office br office and beer if

630
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,080
it's interesting because it shared

631
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,080
uh it had a powerful brand in in latin

632
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,799
america and all of those guys could move

633
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,559
across

634
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:38,080
straight away to to us and so our very

635
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:39,280
first release looked like that and

636
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,439
hopefully you can see

637
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:42,480
some degree of brand continuity let's

638
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:45,840
say uh

639
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:47,039
from the initial initial release so so

640
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:49,199
then there was a whole load of work

641
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:50,240
you know like it was amazing loads of

642
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,600
people arrived

643
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,799
and actually before i talk about that i

644
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:55,039
just want to talk about how we

645
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:56,480
structured the community

646
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:58,320
so my experience of working in free

647
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,200
software has not been prior to

648
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:01,439
libreoffice

649
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,799
has not been one free of conflict let's

650
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,480
say um

651
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:05,760
it was it was routinely my experience

652
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,159
that not only would there be four or

653
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,919
five

654
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:09,679
duplicate approaches to anything say

655
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:11,679
window managers and gnome

656
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:13,679
you know like written in every

657
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:14,240
conceivable language list c plus blast

658
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:16,480
has

659
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:18,400
whatever um but they would actually

660
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:20,799
fight each other quite viciously for

661
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:22,320
for user share mind share market share

662
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:23,440
and they would not talk to each other

663
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,320
either they'd certainly not tell them

664
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,919
what they were going to do

665
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:27,760
in the future you know i mean disclose

666
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:29,600
any anything and so so

667
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,799
actually it's like cats fighting in a

668
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:33,360
bag almost

669
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:35,039
almost everywhere and and this is pretty

670
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:36,240
depressing and it sometimes got personal

671
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:37,360
you know oh don't talk to him he's the

672
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,960
bad guy oh yeah you

673
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:40,959
wanna watch and all these coalitions

674
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:42,240
would be built

675
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,360
and then the mailing list would arrive

676
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,400
and they'd fight tooth and nail on the

677
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:46,240
mailing list as well

678
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,600
i i speak from experience as one who

679
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,720
used to fight tooth and nail on mailing

680
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:52,000
list

681
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:54,159
anyway if you if you read all of the

682
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,919
literature on conflict resolution

683
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:58,480
using email to resolve conflicts is a

684
00:20:55,919 --> 00:21:01,760
reliable way of making everything worse

685
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:02,880
okay like this is this is kind of easy

686
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,960
you know this is they tell you something

687
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:07,200
like this is the first day in hr

688
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:08,880
and yeah so so it's absolutely

689
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,919
ridiculous and of course giving control

690
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,679
and ownership and like this

691
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:13,039
maintainership where you own something

692
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:14,960
and it can be taken from you

693
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:16,400
and you you know you've got to fight to

694
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:19,600
hold on to it and so on

695
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,720
ah yeah it was absolutely nonsense so we

696
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:23,120
from the very beginning had

697
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,919
phone calls of the engineering steering

698
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:26,479
committee

699
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:27,360
in whom everyone was peers they were all

700
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:30,080
the right people

701
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:32,080
all the people doing the work of course

702
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,520
if you have a respected expert in calc

703
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:35,039
and someone who works somewhere totally

704
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:36,080
different telling them what to do

705
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:37,440
everyone's going to give them a pretty

706
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:40,720
hard stare right like i mean

707
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:43,039
you need to respect experts but yeah

708
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:44,720
no one owns owns modules but of course

709
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:47,360
this is a bit of a problem for people

710
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:50,000
that don't speak english like i do

711
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:51,678
and so what we do is we transcribe live

712
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,039
transcribe the meetings so as people

713
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:55,440
speak it's written down

714
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:56,158
so everyone can follow and uh get

715
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:59,440
involved

716
00:21:56,159 --> 00:22:02,240
and so in at least the technical sphere

717
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:04,240
there have been as far as i'm aware no

718
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:06,799
instances of conflict

719
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:08,320
no significant duplications of anything

720
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:11,280
and everybody has worked

721
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:12,720
uh reasonably happily together so yeah

722
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,840
it's it's just a blissful experience

723
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,039
libreoffice if you want to work in a

724
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,799
project where it's fun

725
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:18,559
and there's not massive conflict uh come

726
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:20,158
and see us anyway

727
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:22,320
so what do we do well gnu make we made

728
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:24,080
the make the build system easy to use

729
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:26,639
uh we fixed a whole load of coverity

730
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:27,280
defects uh we did systematic crash load

731
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,640
testing

732
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:30,480
interestingly we were always told that

733
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,600
we were the dirty hackers that didn't

734
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:33,360
know what they were doing and they were

735
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,240
the professional developers with our eye

736
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:36,320
teams and

737
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,280
you know process and so on um but you

738
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:40,158
know we just just

739
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:40,799
fixed so much junk in the in the code

740
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:42,559
base

741
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:44,879
over time i mean it's even fully

742
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:47,678
translated now the code base um

743
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:49,039
unit testing from not existing at all to

744
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:50,000
you know starting to be you know quite

745
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:51,840
significant

746
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,120
automated performance regression testing

747
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:55,120
running in valgrind

748
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:56,479
this is this is a cache grind is a

749
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:58,639
wonderful tool

750
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:00,799
and it's wonderful for one reason which

751
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:02,720
is that over over years of development

752
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:05,039
where nothing changed this line is flat

753
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,720
completely flat there's no jitter so you

754
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:09,360
can see from commit to commit you didn't

755
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:11,760
cause a regression even a small one

756
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:13,439
proper crash reporting fixing that code

757
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,400
quality improvement we threw every tool

758
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,919
at it we could find

759
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:18,559
pretty much and people were willing to

760
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:20,640
fund probably the best is oss fuzz

761
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:21,678
google's thing they're using afl and

762
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,120
clang but

763
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:24,320
just lots of other stuff and what you

764
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:26,320
discover is that as soon as you

765
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:28,320
introduce a new tool okay verity say

766
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:30,639
there's a massive burst of fixing and

767
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:31,918
then it tails off

768
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:33,360
and so you think oh we're brilliant

769
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:34,480
we've fixed everything and then you

770
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,918
introduce another one it finds a

771
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,360
different set of problems and we fix

772
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:39,280
those

773
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:41,439
so so here's the active commit account

774
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:43,760
um so it's it's a bit dodgy before

775
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:45,600
we use git but you can see various

776
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:47,520
historic things here so sun

777
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,959
sun was bought by oracle at this point

778
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:50,879
so you can see

779
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,080
the the things happen there cesar

780
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:54,240
decides to exit

781
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:55,600
uh a libre office and does it

782
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,120
beautifully cleanly

783
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:59,039
and you can see it tapers slightly but

784
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:00,399
they they then spin out calabra

785
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:02,080
and put some staff in there and some

786
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:05,039
funding to to create the company i

787
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:06,799
i run which is great at sib comes out of

788
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:07,440
caesar a bit and starts to do some stuff

789
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:10,799
this

790
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:11,760
screen line uh you can see uh yeah um so

791
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:14,720
you can see all sorts of things there

792
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:17,919
you can also see oracle disappearing

793
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:19,200
bingo suddenly gone and you can also see

794
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:20,960
the magnitude you know that we we

795
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:23,679
managed to recover the project

796
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:26,080
and keep it alive uh despite the the

797
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:28,799
sudden loss of staff

798
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:31,360
native languages yeah like 145 used

799
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:33,600
languages four and a half thousand plus

800
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:35,039
users doing translation fantastic work

801
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,959
there thank you for all

802
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:38,720
uh who do that and of course you would

803
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,679
regularly meet up fosdem was uh yeah

you know fosdem you know the support of

806
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:45,360
the open source community made this

807
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:47,120
made this fun you know it was nice to

808
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:49,120
come and talk and tell you the stories

809

of what we were doing uh give you usb

810
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:52,479
keys with the code on it

811
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:54,320
help you get started get people's first

812
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,840
hacks done you know plug the thing into

813

collecting scalps leonard pottering has

817
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:03,360
a commit in it you know uh

818

are all over the place uh you know

826
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,679
the first one we were not good at taking

827
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:18,720
pictures as you can see but we got

828
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:20,960
better and better

829
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:22,000
and you know lots and lots of people

830
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:24,640
over the years

831
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:27,120
uh working on this susicon is next oh it

832
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:27,120
works again

833
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:32,080
excellent and then i'm just going to

834
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:34,399
flick through these

835
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:35,600
[Music]

836
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:38,159
i'm going to flick through these very

837
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:40,559
very quickly um

838
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:41,440
aha vba yes so i'm going to flick

839
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:42,639
through these quickly and i'm not going

840
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,240
to tell you anything about them because

841
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:46,400
the purpose of these features

842
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:48,400
is not the features but anyway a g

you know odf obviously helps you

899
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:28,240
liberate your documents if you can

900
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:30,080
already load them and

901
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:31,840
transfer to that but you know there's

00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:47,760
absolutely loads of these things out

910
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:50,240
there right i mean i gave up in 2016.

911
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:52,080

uh colab nexcloud own cloud pydio

916
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:02,880
roof matamos well so why do i show you

917
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:04,559
all these things

918
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:06,640
because all of these things represent

919
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:09,678
years man decades

920
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:11,520
tens of man decades of work okay

921
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:12,960
twenties a man thirties of man decades

922
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,080
of work

923
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,440
and one of the problems we have as

924
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,000
engineers is that we think if we make

925
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:19,679
the software

926
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:21,520
better uh they will come you know

927
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:24,080
uh if you build the better mousetrap

928
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:25,840
people will buy it

929
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:27,840
and i still believe that you know if you

930
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:28,320
look at how i invest my own personal

931
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,760
money

932
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:32,399
you know it's in software development my

933
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:35,760
time is isn't some of them but actually

934
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:37,199
here's the tragedy it took five years

935
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,799
so most of the features i just showed

936
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:41,520
you there were already in

937
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:42,799
libreoffice and yet still more people

938
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:44,240
were downloading

939
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:45,840
something that fundamentally hasn't

940
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:48,640
changed in any

941
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:49,678
any feature function way since it was

942
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,919
launched

943
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:52,799
so this is the open office a trend line

944
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:55,039
right

945
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:56,080
and i i google cannot lie you know this

946
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:58,240
is uh this is

947
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:59,520
hard data from from you know loads and

948
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:02,159
loads of searches

949
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:03,520
and so actually all that branding that

950
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:04,240
we built in the first 10 years of

951
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:06,960
openoffice

952
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:07,760
took a huge amount of effort to turn

953
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,760
into

954
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:12,240
you know something positive and open and

955
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:14,240
uh you know community driven and so on

956
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:15,840
that actually works and get our brands

957
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:17,919
the point where people can see it

958
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:19,600
and that's a little bit concerning it's

959
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:22,159
a bit concerning

960
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:23,678
um and and we still have 250 000

961
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:25,279
downloads a week of something that is a

962
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:28,720
museum

963
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:29,520
of office productivity um which is a

964
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,960
great shame

965
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:33,440
it's disappointing users i mean it's

966
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:34,960
fair enough to to have museums i mean

967
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:37,279
it's good it's good i mean i love to

968
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:39,919
visit them it's it's interesting

969
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:41,520
but it disappoints users and it gives

970
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:43,120
them a bad image of

971
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:44,879
what free software can do and the

972
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:47,439
dynamism and excitement

973
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:48,640
that's possible there and so i think

974
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:50,159
there's two things there this is pretty

975
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:52,159
shameful and it should be fixed and

976
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:54,559
we've tried really hard to do that

977
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:56,480
but but also that the brand is really

978
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:58,559
important branding really matters

979
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:59,919
the equity you're putting into that name

980
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:01,520
you know and i still my friends still

981
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:02,960
say open office by mistake from time to

982
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,520
time it's one of those cognitive slips

983
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:06,320
that you know

984
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:07,918
that just sort of happens um and it's a

985
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,960
shame so it's very easy to think it's

986
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:12,480
about the code

987
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:13,120
about the features but actually branding

988
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,440
trademark

989
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:16,799
ecosystem investment almost more

990
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:19,279
important

991
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:19,918
uh i it's sad to say it but economics

992
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:21,200
drives

993
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:23,039
almost everything so you can see the

994
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,679
graph here of commands companies are

995
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:25,520
doing

996
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:27,039
nearly three-quarters of the commits in

997
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:29,200
libreoffice and they're awesome we love

998
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:31,600
all of our ecosystem

999
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:32,799
but yeah that's pretty frightening

1000
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:35,199
they're of course mentoring

1001
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:37,200
much of the rest of the quarter as well

1002
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,880
right

1003
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,720
so how do you do that and one of the

1004
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:42,640
problems is the libreoffice has a brand

1005
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:44,960
and that brand drives people to

1006
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:46,480
a non-profit foundation which is which

1007
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:48,080
is wonderful

1008
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:49,440
but how can you then encourage people to

1009
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:51,678
invest in that how can you give them a

1010
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:53,600
stake in that and a viable business

1011
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:54,720
i currently something like point one two

1012
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:56,320
percent of people that hit the

1013
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:58,080
libreoffice web page

1014
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:59,840
even discover there are professional

1015
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:03,039
services around it

1016
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:04,639
okay so almost all of them donate

1017
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:06,158
something and download which is which is

1018
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:08,159
great

1019
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:10,159
um but yeah how can you build that

1020
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:12,480
thriving eq system such that this

1021
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:14,080
this graph begins to be slightly similar

1022
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:15,679
to this graph

1023
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,960
or at least a closer and as you see

1024
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:17,519
we're making progress i think it's gone

1025
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:20,159
up from

1026
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:23,120
point zero five percent to point one two

1027
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:24,480
percent in the last year so there you go

1028
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:26,239
anyway people are downloading it the

1029
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:27,760
good news is we have you know i don't

1030
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:29,519
know a million

1031
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:32,080
eight hundred thousand uh downloads a

1032
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:33,279
week which is which is encouraging

1033
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:35,519
uh and certainly you know in the right

1034
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:36,399
ballpark and going upwards uh which we

1035
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:38,960
like although

1036
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:39,678
heavily seasonal and and of course

1037
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,799
interestingly

1038
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:42,640
i mean it's a business product that

1039
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:43,440
people use so they at the weekend it

1040
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:46,720
drops off

1041
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:47,919
and at christmas um yeah donations seem

1042
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:49,840
to be going in the right direction

1043
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:51,679
um and one this is a huge strength we're

1044
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:55,199
just so grateful to our

1045
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:58,000
64 000 donors who each gave

1046
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:59,120
you know eight bucks each or whatever uh

1047
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,640
to help us run

1048
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:02,799
the foundation 12 12 bucks feature

1049
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:06,000
whatever it is um

1050
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:07,440
that's really cool absolutely cool so

1051
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,880
here we are i'm supposed to invade on

1052
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,440
the future and this is the very risky

1053
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:12,240
part

1054
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:14,080
uh you know who knows um i'm convinced

1055
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:15,039
the future is a rocket ship you know so

1056
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,799
so there we go

1057
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:18,640
um but but who can predict the future

1058
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:19,760
here so you can listen to your users and

1059
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:22,240
see what they want

1060
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:23,519
here's a here's a selection everything

1061
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,080
is going to move to the web and go

1062
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:26,399
online

1063
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:29,279
everything else will be totally totally

1064
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:31,760
ignored it'll all be in the browser

1065
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:32,480
the next quote is from the same person

1066
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:34,320
oh it's just

1067
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:36,240
so cool i can download the app and run

1068
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:38,320
it natively on my chromebook

1069
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:39,279
i wish we could fix the bugs in that

1070
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:41,039
you're like really

1071
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:42,880
interesting and these are not this is a

1072
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:44,399
strategy you know strategy

1073
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:46,399
people to sense why respect their view

1074
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:47,439
right um i want to collaborate on my

1075
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:50,000
mobile phone you know

1076
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:51,200
so phone's obviously the future um i

1077
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
want to be able to load edit docs

1078
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,440
offline you know

1079
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,039
um i want to be able to use the

1080
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:56,320
in-network when there is no network you

1081
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:56,720
know all this all those sort of other

1082
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,960
things

1083
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:01,039
um it seems clear to me that the the

1084
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:02,960
obvious solution is um

1085
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:05,120
is to create a uh an artificial

1086
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:07,679
intelligence of stunning subtlety and

1087
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:08,399
you know conversational brilliance that

1088
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:10,159
can see

1089
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:12,080
what we should be doing at every point

1090
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:14,080
uh so if you'd like to help join us and

1091
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:15,120
and do that that's uh that's that's

1092
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:16,399
great um

1093
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,840
the other great way i have a predicting

1094
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:18,639
the future is is telling you what's

1095
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:20,720
already done

1096
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:22,480
and just pending release so there's a

1097
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:24,240
whole load of cool stuff in calibre

1098
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:25,120
online it allows collaborative editing

1099
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:27,360
of documents

1100
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:28,239
on your premise you own it digital

1101
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:30,559
sovereignty

1102
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:32,960
uh no control to anyone else so nice

1103
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:35,279
sidebar stuff coming here on the right

1104
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:36,080
to make the ui richer things that no one

1105
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:38,960
else does

1106
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:39,360
transitions animations and so on uh well

1107
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:41,919
um

1108
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:43,360
just just you know prettiness coming

1109
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:45,679
editing master pages

1110
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:47,279
for your presentation online you know i

1111
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:49,760
don't think anyone else does this

1112
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:51,279
it's too advanced a feature managing

1113
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:54,320
conditional formats

1114
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:57,039
rich dialogues to do that prettier ui

1115
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:58,720
formula wizards uh you know just cool

1116
00:33:57,039 --> 00:34:00,000
color correcting your images in your in

1117
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:02,159
your documents and so on

1118
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,600
a better handle for resizing for

1119
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:05,760
spreadsheet stuff

1120
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:07,760
url pop-ups and so on and of course the

1121
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:10,800
mobile mobile version 2

1122
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:14,079
has had a completely new one-handed

1123
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:16,800
ui rework so this is um you can download

1124
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:19,760
this as collabora online mobile beta

1125
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:21,440
and it's improving very rapidly it looks

1126
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:22,800
familiar to people i hope

1127
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,918
but again you can do cool things in

1128
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,599
there you can't do actually we're just

1129
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:25,918
taking the sidebar and wrapping this and

1130
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:27,359
re

1131
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:29,520
redoing that as native javascript

1132
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:31,279
widgets um so you can uh

1133
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:33,040
you can get lots of cool functionality

1134
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:35,359
there

1135
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:37,839
ios versions for for tablets and of

1136
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:39,679
course that they work on android too

1137
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:41,279
um so so that's i think partly the

1138
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:44,560
future um

1139
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:46,240
more mobile more online more

1140
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:48,159
more richness but all reusing that same

1141
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:50,879
core code base that's got

1142
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:51,760
you know 35 years of awesome work

1143
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:54,399
underneath it

1144
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:55,520
underpinning that and you know some

1145
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:57,598
really good functionality

1146
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:58,720
so we'd love people to get involved we

1147
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:00,480
have easy hacks

1148
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:02,560
we've paid a lot of technical debt down

1149
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:05,200
but there's lots more to do

1150
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:06,078
if you love javascript after you've seen

1151
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,839
your doctor

1152
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:09,280
uh you can come come and help us you

1153
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:10,720
know it's a it's

1154
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:12,240
yeah it's a challenging and exciting

1155
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:13,200
language but we have plenty of

1156
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:16,160
javascript that needs

1157
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:17,200
these uh doing c plus plus ux design

1158
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:18,160
there's all sorts of things whatever

1159
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,839
your skills are

1160
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:22,078
we would love to work with you come and

1161
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:23,200
talk to me um user experience i think is

1162
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:24,960
one of the things that we really need to

1163
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:26,480
be working on more

1164
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:28,240
it's one of those never quite done

1165
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:30,079
things but there are still loads of

1166
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:30,799
paper cuts there there is a ux team that

1167
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:32,320
meet

1168
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:34,000
they have things they'd love to do

1169
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:36,160
they're specified they have lush

1170
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,599
artwork for it but they just need a

1171
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:40,399
couple of programmers to help them

1172
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:41,520
do the simple typing to make this work

1173
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:44,160
and then of course when you change the

1174
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:47,920
ui the documentation needs updating

1175
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:49,359
so i think i'm almost in time

1176
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:51,839
so i think that's pretty much the story

1177
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:53,040
of uh libreoffice open office maybe a

1178
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:54,799
bit about star office

1179
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:56,480
the star of his times i was not there

1180
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:58,160
you know i i'm afraid i

1181
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:59,520
i only joined at the very end of star

1182
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,240
office and talked to the open office

1183
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,440
people

1184
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:03,439
so i could be there at the launch and

1185
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:06,320
help this uh this gnome

1186
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:07,920
uh open office compromise but we did

1187
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:09,200
what we had to uh to make the code base

1188
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:12,640
survive

1189
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:14,000
um yeah and just the sheer number of

1190
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:16,000
people that did things there is

1191
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,119
way exceeds my ability to write all

1192
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,160
their names down

1193
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:21,680
in the taxi while i was coming here um

1194
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:23,200
which is when i finished much of the

1195
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:25,279
slides um but

1196
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:26,720
thank you thank you for all of the work

1197
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:28,560
from those people are there

1198
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:30,799
i think a key a key thing is that our

1199
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:32,960
digital sovereignty is really important

1200
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:34,720
um you know if you look at china china

1201
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:35,599
collects your data in order to control

1202
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:38,000
you

1203
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:38,640
uh and to oppress you probably or to

1204
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,119
maintain

1205
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:42,560
social stability uh with them with the

1206
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:44,240
with the right people at the top

1207
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:46,560
uh is the perhaps a positive

1208
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:48,640
construction um

1209
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:49,759
america of course uh gathers your data

1210
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:52,078
to sell you things

1211
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:53,680
uh so you know a different uh different

1212
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:54,880
different way of looking at data

1213
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:56,399
and of course the european union has a

1214
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,040
chance to pass you know have a different

1215
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:59,200
path

1216
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:00,640
uh where we you know we help drive and

1217
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,598
teach the world about the importance of

1218
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:02,799
guarding your

1219
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:04,640
and controlling your not only your

1220
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:05,680
software but also your data keeping it

1221
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:08,160
on your premise

1222
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:09,200
uh controlling yourself and and we

1223
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:11,520
really enable that

1224
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:12,960
you know and i am excited it's not just

1225
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:14,960
us of course we do the office

1226
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:16,240
collaborative piece but i've shown you

1227
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,960
some of the integrations we have the

1228
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:18,799
partners

1229
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:20,240
there are great great tools and products

1230
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:21,200
let me encourage you to work on those

1231
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,959
and help

1232
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:24,799
move people towards protecting

1233
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:26,480
themselves their sovereignty

1234
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:28,560
and arguably their society in the long

1235
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:30,240
run so we need your help

1236
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:31,839

1237
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:34,879

beyond that we rely on your support you

1243
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:45,118
know maybe you never contributed

1244
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:46,240
anything to libreoffice but we we love

1245
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:46,880
the fact that you tell your friends

1246
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:48,319
about it

1247
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:50,720
uh that you help us with our branding

1248
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:52,160
problem that you you keep us alive and

1249
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:53,759
you you turn up and listen to this sort

1250
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:55,359
of nonsense so thank you

1251

00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:09,440
so if we can have a few questions i

1255
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:10,480
think we have you have plenty of time to

1256
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,760
get to the next talk

1257
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:13,920
that is the first thing to say i have

1258
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:14,480
finished ridiculously early there's 20

1259
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,920
minutes

1260
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:18,079
you know and then something else will

1261
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:20,640
happen so you can rest and relax

1262
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:21,680
we have a question or ask questions you

1263
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:25,520
know that's that's

1264
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:27,598
fantastic oh well get some water

1265
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:28,560
well thanks michael for a great talk i

1266
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:30,839
would like to hear

1267
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:32,078
maybe a little bit more about the

1268
00:38:30,839 --> 00:38:34,880
certification

1269
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:36,880
are the document foundation happy with

1270
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:38,079
the current state of the certification

1271
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:41,119
would you like to see

1272
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:43,119
more certifications exam and maybe

1273
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:45,200
partner up with linux professional

1274
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:48,320
institute so you can take them

1275
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:50,319
both together i don't know cool

1276
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:51,760
so i think we discovered earlier the

1277
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:53,040
acoustics are not wonderful in here for

1278
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:54,320
questions but i think you said you want

1279
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:56,400
more certification

1280
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:58,640
and linux professional institute

1281
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:00,720
certification exams and so on

1282
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:02,078
we'd love that anyone that can help

1283
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:04,160
contribute is good

1284
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:06,000
our certification currently is primarily

1285
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:07,839
focused on professionals

1286
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,920
to help grow our ecosystem and get more

1287
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:11,520
companies and individuals to contribute

1288
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:13,440
to and improve the project

1289
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:15,119
um so end user certification is not what

1290
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:16,160
we're doing really um but we'd love

1291
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:18,320
other people to do that

1292
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:19,279
talk to italo he's here and he runs or

1293
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:21,040
loaf rebecca

1294
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:22,720
see i go to your booth and chat to them

1295
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:26,400
if you have good ideas and you can help

1296
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:29,279
we'd love it good good idea what's up

1297
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:29,920
hi i'm alex first many thanks for for

1298
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:32,720
for the

1299
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:34,160
libreoffice students like it's great uh

1300
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:36,799
i'm still like i have

1301
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:38,000
two questions one the first one is do

1302
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:42,000
you

1303
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:44,640
um still have uh um

1304
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,760
trouble with the lack of documentation

1305
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:48,480
for microsoft's

1306
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:49,200
format like that the new one that the

1307
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:52,720
newer ones

1308
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:55,359
and their support ability uh that's uh

1309
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:56,000
the first thing and the second thing is

1310
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:58,880
uh

1311
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,520
who what do you see is your like

1312
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:01,920
greatest

1313
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:03,359
competition is like is it like still

1314
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:06,640
microsoft office

1315
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:09,920
or uh the the google uh documents

1316
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:10,879
uh ecosystem or is that an opportunity

1317
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:12,160
to grow

1318
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:13,680
yeah so good two good questions the

1319
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:15,598
first was about open xml and

1320
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:17,279
documentation and interoperability

1321
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:19,040
so i think i think our interoperability

1322
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:20,319
is outstanding and improving

1323
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:22,400
um i don't think there's any other code

1324
00:40:20,319 --> 00:40:23,920
base that does as well as we do in terms

1325
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:25,520
of allowing you to view and understand

1326
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:28,000
and edit those documents

1327
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:28,560
um you know look these are very old code

1328
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,400
bases

1329
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:31,680
microsoft calls it source code legacy

1330
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:35,040
rich

1331
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:36,799
and i think that's a positive framing um

1332
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:38,240
the documentation is pretty good it's

1333
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:39,359
usually not the documentation it's the

1334
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:41,680
problem it's the time

1335
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:42,640
spent to implement the feature because

1336
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,839
it's no good

1337
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:46,400
if you don't have the feature you can't

1338
00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:47,759
interoperate terribly easily

1339
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:50,640
so that was that and then in terms of

1340
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:52,800
your other question which was

1341
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:53,759
competition uh who's our competition

1342
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:56,000
well i hope

1343

1352
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,119
of marketing niches you know digital

1353
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:15,280
sovereignty is a great niche to be in

1354
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:17,119
people who care about having their data

1355
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:19,359
