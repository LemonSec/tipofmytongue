1
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,800
a triple threat here from the open

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,360
electronics lab

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,719
um three presenters and they're going to

4
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:15,440
give us an overview

5
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:15,759
of their development of open hardware

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,439
and

7
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:19,760
kind of transitioning from getting into

8
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:21,680
that into some really awesome

9
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,519
hardware that they are that they have

10
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,800
developed and that that are available

11
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:27,680
for people to look at

12
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,320
uh work and reuse so uh please give a

13
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:31,039
warm

14
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,039
welcome to

15
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:34,079
thank you

16
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:41,599
so i'm eric uh with me is kendrick shaw

17
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:44,000
and ace medlock we're the repository

18
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:47,520
admins of the open electronics lab

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,879
and when we got started

20
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,000
in 2011 we were a lot more novice than

21
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:55,280
we are today

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,320
perhaps like some of you back in 2011 i

23
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:00,079
had never done smd solder work ever

24
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,520
never done any surface mount i looked at

25
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:03,760
the multi-layer boards

26
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,280
and i felt really pretty like that end

27
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,640
of stuff was outside of the realm of

28
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,920
hobbyist i do a little bit of

29
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,720
through-hole soldering that's that's

30
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,560
kind of it

31
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,000
uh but then there was this really

32
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,759
interesting chip that came out it was

33
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,920
only available in uh an smd package

34
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:19,520
and uh and we thought well okay maybe we

35
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,400
can build a breakout board for it so a

36
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,360
single

37
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,920
uh uh so a single uh thing we can do for

38
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,520
that

39
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,680
uh and and sure enough we were able to

40
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,479
do that uh i only screwed up one board

41
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,200
in the process

42
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:31,759
uh so it wasn't too bad uh and and from

43
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,759
there

44
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:34,799
we went all in on the service mount and

45
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:36,799
we built something

46
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:39,280
that we weren't just getting eeg signals

47
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:40,640
on but we were able to get uh ocular

48
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,840
signal and

49
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:45,920
and ekg and muscular things and we were

50
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,000
even able to control a mouse pointer

51
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,119
using our mind it was pretty neat and

52
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,759
people started asking

53
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:53,360
hey can i get one of those but these

54
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:54,000
things were big they were difficult to

55
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,159
build we didn't

56
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,240
know enough about putting test points on

57
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,520
to modularize your design to make it

58
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,600
easy to debug

59
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,798
uh and and so we said no we don't want

60
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,479
to be in the

61
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:07,119
uh we don't want to be in the business

62
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:10,478
of uh of testing this stuff so

63
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:11,680
um so we we designed something that was

64
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:13,440
a little bit more accessible so

65
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,840
something that you can build yourself

66
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,520
uh and or you can have somebody fab it

67
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,440
for you uh it's pretty straightforward

68
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:22,560
it's not super expensive

69
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:25,840
sits right on top of an arduino and

70
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:27,200
and you can play with uh driving your

71
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,760
quadcopter whatever

72
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,238
um and and that got people interested in

73
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:35,040
one day

74
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:37,519
uh uh robin from uh hementon joined our

75
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,879
uh our session and he gave us the

76
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:40,959
insight that in the

77
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:42,480
low resource environments poor countries

78
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:43,920
in africa and such what's killing their

79
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,640
devices is not what i expected i

80
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,238
expected like

81
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,839
humidity and dust and things like that

82
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:49,519
he said it was bad power

83
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,040
uh and so we started thinking well maybe

84
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:52,480
we could maybe we could build a device

85
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:55,679
suitable for that environment

86
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:58,799
so how do you get from where novices

87
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,879
to we're gonna build uh

88
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,360
a piece of medical equipment well

89
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:06,000
there's a lot of foss tools out there

90
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,720
to support you from the novice through

91
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,920
your growth

92
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:12,000
and your experience and i think the

93
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:13,839
arduino boards are great place

94
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,239
to start and there's all sorts of tools

95
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,560
to get you going

96
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:19,680
key cad is what we started with and as

97
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,840
we've grown

98
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,599
everything we've even won throat kick

99
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:26,480
head it's it's handled for us

100
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:28,159
uh we do some fairly complex uh uh

101
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,480
schematic design obviously

102
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:31,519
and then here's like a six layer board

103
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,440
um and

104
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:35,440
by the way if you're doing any schematic

105
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,959
design or excuse me board design today

106
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:39,040
i really recommend using four layer

107
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,560
boards because anytime i'm trying to go

108
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,920
diagonal across the board i don't want

109
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,720
to try to sneak around all the

110
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,359
components

111
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,799
i want one layer that's just horizontal

112
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:50,000
one layer that's just vertical

113
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:52,799
i via down go over and up pop out and

114
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,920
and then i'm there really saves time on

115
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:57,439
my layouts

116
00:03:53,920 --> 00:04:00,798
uh so um and then also

117
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:03,519
i recommend doing some yourself hand do

118
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:04,480
some yourself but it's not that much

119
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:06,080
expensive to

120
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,079
to get them pre-populated and you can

121
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,959
get them with combinations of

122
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,519
through-hole

123
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:14,319
and smd two-sided this thing has

124
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:17,519
everything except one component uh and

125
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:18,000
and that way uh that yeah okay i have to

126
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,478
do the

127
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
the room chip uh ourselves but but

128
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:25,440
that's not that's not

129
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,800
uh that's not a huge time investment um

130
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,560
the arduino build environment no matter

131
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,880
how novice you are you say i'm not a c

132
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,160
coder i don't do embedded dev uh this is

133
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,600
a great place to start

134
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,600
it if you've done any development

135
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,240
whatsoever they've really made it fairly

136
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,400
easy

137
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,000
now as as you get more experience you

138
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,320
may move away from this tool you may

139
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,440
use more you may like your different

140
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:46,080
libraries and such

141
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:48,160
but uh but in terms of early prototyping

142
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:50,000
to this day we still reach to this first

143
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,360
when we're we're playing with something

144
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,199
new because it's so

145
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,120
quick and easy to get up and running get

146
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:57,280
something going

147
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:59,120
um and then another tool that we really

148
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:02,719
have uh enjoyed using

149
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:04,400
is openscad i'm not an artist i'm not

150
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,919
gonna draw beautiful things

151
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:10,799
in in uh in the

152
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:11,599
whatever the art programs are um but i

153
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,039
am a developer

154
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,600
so i want to be able to programmatically

155
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:18,560
describe this is the shape of the thing

156
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,759
and have it render and then uh have one

157
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,560
of our other collaborators

158
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:24,639
print it out for us so um so that's a

159
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,000
little bit about about how the tools are

160
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:29,520
and i'll hand the mic over to ace and

161
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,520
she can talk about soldering thanks

162
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:35,440
so uh as eric mentioned when we started

163
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,440
out we were really pretty intimidated by

164
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,560
doing surface mount soldering and so we

165
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,120
designed a board that had

166
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,560
only one chip on it that had uh needed

167
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,320
surface mount soldering

168
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,080
and we got on youtube and we took a look

169
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,880
at some videos and saw how other people

170
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,400
were doing it

171
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,159
and that actually made us pretty bold it

172
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,120
worked as eric said second try which is

173
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,039
not too bad

174
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,800
and so our next board we decided we

175
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:55,280
wanted to reduce the noise which meant

176
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,600
that

177
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,318
using all surface mount components now

178
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,639
surface mount

179
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:02,319
components are pretty tiny so the way we

180
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:04,080
decided to approach it is by

181
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:05,600
using solder paste so solder paste is

182
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,159
kind of sticky stuff you put it on the

183
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,919
pads

184
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,440
you stick your component down to the pad

185
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:10,400
you heat it up with a soldering with a

186
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,400
hot air gun

187
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:14,318
and then the components soldered on so

188
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,159
that all seems pretty straightforward

189
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:17,919
but when we tried it we discovered we

190
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,520
had a lot of bad solder joints it didn't

191
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:21,039
actually work that well for us

192
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,799
now my background is in medicine and

193
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:23,919
when i have to diagnose a problem i like

194
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,680
to get a good look at it

195
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:27,120
so i stuck it under the microscope and

196
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,560
what i found was this so

197
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,160
when you look at solder paste under the

198
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,880
scope it's made of these tiny little

199
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,639
beads

200
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,000
so there's a little solder beads stuck

201
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:35,120
together by the paste

202
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,039
and when you heat it up you get

203
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,880
something like this but you'll

204
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:40,240
can also see it melt but still get

205
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,479
something that looks like this

206
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,280
now does this conduct electricity i

207
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:45,359
don't know

208
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,479
but in some cases it appears it doesn't

209
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,160
and so for us

210
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:50,000
for me that didn't work real well so the

211
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,759
way i do it nowadays

212
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,199
is i do it under the microscope i do it

213
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:55,120
under a dissecting scope

214
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:56,479
so i just put the board under the scope

215
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,000
heat up the soldering iron

216
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:59,840
and when you do that it looks about like

217
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,720
this now the trick is to get a little

218
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,880
bead of solder

219
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,400
on the end of your iron because the iron

220
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,199
itself is too big to make a good

221
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,880
connection

222
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:08,240
between the pad and the component but

223
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,919
the little solder bead the solder is a

224
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,039
great conductor of heat so you can stick

225
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:13,680
that right on there

226
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:14,719
heat it up get your solder then you just

227
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,440
pull the iron away

228
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,479
and do the other side and then you're

229
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,719
all done

230
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:22,960
now you do get some pretty ugly looking

231
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,639
solder joints sometimes but that's okay

232
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,000
because the job of a solder joint is to

233
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:27,680
conduct electricity not to look

234
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,199
beautiful so you'll make some modern art

235
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,880
and that's all right

236
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:33,520
i mean you can do some really tiny parts

237
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:35,360
this way this is a 0201 capacitor that's

238
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:37,198
hand soldered this is the same

239
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,680
magnification as the solder paste that

240
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:41,280
we saw earlier

241
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,800
and the nice thing about that is that

242
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,400
you can you learn to be

243
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,240
bold about being able to fix your

244
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,400
mistakes so this looks great looks

245
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:51,120
beautiful i didn't solder it

246
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:52,878
but the problem is that the pads are in

247
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,560
the order ggs and the feet are in the

248
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:56,160
order of gsd

249
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,599
so that's not so great but that's no

250
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,080
problem you just heat it up with your

251
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:00,479
hot air

252
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:04,000
gun pick that up turn it around stick it

253
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:06,000
back down and it works just fine

254
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,599
and so but what about if you forget a

255
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,199
component why you just you know you're

256
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:10,639
designing so you forget to put something

257
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:12,400
on well that's not a problem either you

258
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:12,960
can just do some green wire fixes and

259
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,479
those through

260
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,000
components make for great green wire

261
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:18,240
fixes

262
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,680
what if you accidentally put a trace

263
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,440
somewhere where it doesn't belong well

264
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:24,000
you can fix that too you get out your

265
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:25,599
your exacto knife and cut through it you

266
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
can even if you have both problems you

267
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,440
can even

268
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,039
lift up one of these little feet and

269
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,319
hook a green wire onto the little foot

270
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:32,240
but sometimes you're going to break off

271
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:34,000
your little foot when you do that

272
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:37,039
and if that happens you can just dremel

273
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,320
into the chip and stick on a green wire

274
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:39,760
so you don't really have to worry about

275
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,000
that either if you make you'll make

276
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:44,000
mistakes you will but you can fix them

277
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,200
but it's also good to anticipate errors

278
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,519
and that's what kendrick's going to talk

279
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,519
to you about

280
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,720
so much like testing a little time spent

281
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:56,719
thinking about safety can save you and

282
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,920
others a lot of pain in the future

283
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,160
so we're going to talk a little bit

284
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:01,760
about that so the first step when you're

285
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:03,040
thinking about safety is basically just

286
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,319
take a moment to think about what could

287
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,839
possibly go wrong

288
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,279
and if you have any real imagination

289
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:08,000
you'll come up with a very long list of

290
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:10,880
things that could go

291
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,480
wrong from there next ask yourself for

292
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:14,160
each of them how serious are they

293
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,000
a lot of them might be pretty minor some

294
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,040
of them might be life-threatening

295
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,959
especially if you're building medical

296
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:21,040
electronics

297
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:22,000
then finally ask yourself or sorry next

298
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,519
ask yourself how likely

299
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,040
it is and again this can vary

300
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:26,320
dramatically you don't have to solve

301
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,599
every problem that's out there if it's

302
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,279
unlikely to happen your device

303
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,959
dropped from an airplane might seriously

304
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:32,160
injure or kill someone you might not

305
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:33,920
need to spend a lot of time worrying

306
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:36,240
about it

307
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,360
so then once you have that amount of

308
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,360
harm and

309
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,200
likelihood of harm then from there you

310
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,920
can calculate out a risk or approximate

311
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,600
a risk

312
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:45,040
there are formal design methodologies

313
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,720
you can go through this but the main

314
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,800
idea is you just combine the two

315
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,560
and come up with in your mind is this an

316
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,319
acceptable level of risk

317
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,760
and what's acceptable can vary quite a

318
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,200
bit um

319
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,480
somebody going out there free climbing

320
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,519
is taking on a lot of risk and they know

321
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,880
they're taking on a lot of risk and

322
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:59,920
they're doing it because it's fun

323
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,360
you can do the same thing in your

324
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,399
hardware design as long as you're aware

325
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,880
of what the risk is

326
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:05,920
and you've chosen to assume it and same

327
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,360
thing with

328
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:09,199
in a medical environment for example

329
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,560
defibrillators device is a device

330
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,680
designed to stop someone's heart at the

331
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,439
press of a button

332
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,719
this is an inherently a dangerous device

333
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,440
because if you do that at the wrong time

334
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,360
it can be very

335
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,560
it can be life threatening but it's

336
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:22,000
worth the risk because if you do at the

337
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:23,920
right time it can save someone's life

338
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,279
if the risk isn't acceptable then you

339
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,640
start thinking about mitigations and

340
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:27,519
basically you can reduce the likelihood

341
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,519
of the event

342
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,640
or reduce the severity of the event so

343
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:33,200
for example

344
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,319
if you have a pacemaker that you worried

345
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,440
about someone hacking

346
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,040
into you could always remove the

347
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,240
internet connectivity from the pacemaker

348
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,399
if you don't really need it

349
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,839
and make it a lot safer take away

350
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:43,600
functionality in the process

351
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:46,160
or you can decrease the severity so for

352
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:48,800
example if you have a life-saving device

353
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:50,240
and it can fail in a catastrophic way

354
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,120
making it fail loudly rather than

355
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,560
quietly

356
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,079
is something that's more likely to

357
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:56,560
attract attention and bring people in to

358
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:59,120
fix it

359
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:00,719
so for a lot of our devices and typical

360
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,760
typically for medical devices one of the

361
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,800
common things we worry about is

362
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,000
electrical shock

363
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,760
you may think oh you're dealing with

364
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,200
five volts no big deal we touch five

365
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,920
volt circuits all the time don't feel

366
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,440
anything

367
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,519
important thing there is that's with dry

368
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:13,440
skin here we're attaching electrodes and

369
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:14,640
turns out this current that matters more

370
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,720
than

371
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,079
voltage for the risk of these things so

372
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:20,480
for example pacemaker

373
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:21,599
typically runs at about one to two volts

374
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,600
for

375
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,360
triggering heartbeats so these aren't

376
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,959
very high voltages

377
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:29,360
and they're relatively low current where

378
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:31,518
it's kind of tens of milliamps the skin

379
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,200
tends to have to low hundreds and

380
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:34,880
literally tens of micro amps to the

381
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,880
heart

382
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:38,560
and if you have an iv in or things like

383
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:40,839
that then you can end up with

384
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:42,160
very low currents very very low

385
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:44,240
resistances

386
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,839
these can show up in the obvious way as

387
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,720
far as flowing in one electrode in your

388
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:48,560
device through the

389
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:50,160
through the heart and back out to the

390
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,439
other electrode but it can also be

391
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,639
something a little less obvious like

392
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,120
maybe through an electrode in your

393
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:55,120
device

394
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,320
through your heart to an earth and to

395
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,279
something like a water faucet that

396
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,120
you're touching

397
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:00,399
or even less obvious than that maybe

398
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,760
you're hooked up to another device

399
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:02,560
that's malfunctioning and if your device

400
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,720
will connect

401
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:06,719
through you to ground your device can

402
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,519
lead to and your device can contribute

403
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,360
to a shock

404
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:11,279
and although your next of kin might

405
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,560
blame that malfunctioning device you'd

406
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:14,320
rather be around to blame the device

407
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,359
yourself

408
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,760
there are a lot of things you can do to

409
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,360
mitigate this so you can simply

410
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,720
and you'll notice those last two cases

411
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,000
you're connected to the ground which

412
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,519
means both devices are plugged into the

413
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,279
wall you can unplug from the wall

414
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:27,200
run your device off of battery or use

415
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:29,200
isolators

416
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,320
nowadays you can cheaply buy isolation

417
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:33,120
that will

418
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:35,040
power isolators and data isolators as

419
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,320
far as optocouplers

420
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,839
if you do that you want to make sure

421
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,720
there's gaps which we talk about is

422
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:41,279
clearance

423
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,880
between the isolated parts and gaps

424
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:43,439
across the surface of the surface board

425
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,439
and

426
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:47,040
off the surfaces because surfaces can

427
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:49,040
get moist or dirty

428
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,160
and so that distance is usually larger

429
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,439
there are a lot of standards but eight

430
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,240
millimeters is usually a pretty good

431
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:55,519
rule of thumb

432
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:56,720
um and it's on the safer side uh

433
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:58,079
we'll skim over this because we're

434
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,639
running out of time but the important

435
00:12:58,079 --> 00:12:59,839
thing is

436
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:02,560
there are standards for how much current

437
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:05,040
your device can run through a person

438
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:06,239
they are rel very low numbers and you

439
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,279
have to think about not only

440
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,639
what can it run through when it's

441
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:10,880
working properly but what happens when

442
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:12,560
things start breaking

443
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:14,320
which is another area to think about so

444
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,760
if your amplifier

445
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,040
the chip that you have as your amplifier

446
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,319
shorts out and that high impedance

447
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,599
connection of the patient now suddenly

448
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,399
connects the patient to voltage and

449
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,160
ground

450
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:24,000
what do you have protecting the patient

451
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:25,279
and for an example like that typically

452
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,639
you can just put in some resistors

453
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:28,240
in the leads leading off to the patient

454
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,839
to make sure that total current flowing

455
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,839
through in that failure case

456
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:34,160
will be less than the safe amount of

457
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:37,200
current

458
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:38,800
so with that just wanted to close

459
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,320
basically spend a little time thinking

460
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,040
about safety it's not hard and can go a

461
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,320
long way

462
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,800
you have a lot of great tools for

463
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:47,360
getting into electronics and open source

464
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,479
hardware don't be intimidated just get

465
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,720
your feet wet jump in

466
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,320
and you'll get better as you go and

467
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,079
happy hacking

468
00:13:52,320 --> 00:14:03,839
and we have a number of references up

469
00:13:54,079 --> 00:14:03,839
here for you

470
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:32,160
i really have to

471
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:35,439
congratulate you for your creativity and

472
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:37,760
at the same time i totally understand

473
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,560
always thinking about that because some

474
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:42,240
some project

475
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:42,800
needs to be done or to have a very early

476
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,959
test

477
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,959
and

478
00:14:53,839 --> 00:15:00,959
we typically work on saturdays

479
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:02,000
not a great day um where do you get or

480
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:04,560
where do i get

481
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,560
dissecting

482
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:08,560
sure yeah so the question is where do

483
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,079
you get a dissecting scope and the

484
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:12,638
answer is of course the internet

485
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:14,319
um so so this is not really a special

486
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:16,000
dissecting scope this is actually just

487
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:18,320
the cheapest one that had uh

488
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,600
an arm because a lot of the scopes have

489
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,399
a platform where you're supposed to set

490
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,000
your specimen

491
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:23,360
and you will burn that platform so don't

492
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,079
get that one get the one with an arm

493
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,480
that comes out

494
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:27,439
and you can set your your uh board on

495
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,199
something that's heat

496
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:31,120
resistant how much did you pay for that

497
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:41,839
uh it was about 300 euros i think

498
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:41,839
to 250 300 so cool

499
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:55,839
yeah yeah so so kendrick actually uses

500
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:55,839
one of those i prefer the analog version

501
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,319
so he's showing us a version version of

502
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:04,320
our board which is great to see

503
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:06,639
um and the fact i believe you're

504
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:08,240
pointing to the two dc to dc converters

505
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:10,079
on the bottom for galvanic

506
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,839
isolation buffers i mean you have these

507
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:15,120
you have this very very uh

508
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:17,759
clear interruption of everything of all

509
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:18,720
all power planes in the uh between the

510
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:21,839
um

511
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:23,199
between the ads and the arduino

512
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:24,800
that's an excellent question this gets

513
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:25,359
down to the idea that especially if

514
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,359
you're doing an

515
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,639
ecg someone may attach a defibrillator

516
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:31,440
to the patient

517
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:32,320
um and put 5000 volts or more through

518
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,440
the patient

519
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,800
you don't want that getting to the

520
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,680
person at the computer or other

521
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,758
operators

522
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:39,599
so you want to have good isolation

523
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:42,000
between the patient side

524
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:44,240
and the side that the computers are on

525
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,199
so that gap there is making sure that we

526
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,720
have

527
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:49,199
that eight millimeters of distance

528
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:51,199
between any metal part on the board

529
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:53,040
on the isolated non-isolated side and

530
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:54,800
there's two of them which reinforces

531
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:56,079
yes so we want to make sure that any

532
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:58,800
component can fail

533
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:59,920
the data isolation we have a single one

534
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:02,000
because it's rated

535
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:03,040
for uh reinforced isolation so it's

536
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,439
rated to

537
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:07,678
be as reliable as two pieces of

538
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:10,000
equipment normally

539
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:11,120
then we have two on the other side we

540
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,480
have two digi

541
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:15,280
and two power isolators such that if one

542
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,039
of them fails

543
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:19,839
the other one is still providing that

544
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:23,119
5000 volts of isolation

545
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:25,599
okay follow-up question yes

546
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:27,039
uh we are not pacing at the moment um we

547
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:33,840
may add that to our list we've talked

548
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:33,840
about it yeah

549
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:41,410
[Music]

550
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:47,919
yes the question was did the dremel

551
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,679
chip survive the operation and yes the

552
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:51,120
dremel chip did survive the operation

553
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:52,880
and just to be clear this is where the

554
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:54,559
wire would go into the plastic case

555
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,080
before it goes down to where it's wire

556
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:57,678
bonded the chip so it's not

557
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:59,280
soldering directly to the chip but it's

558
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:00,400
starting to the lead going inside the

559
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:05,540
plastic case

560
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:05,540
[Laughter]

561
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:15,840
okay thank you so much

562
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,360
you
