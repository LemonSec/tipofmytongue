1
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,960
all right

2
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,960
so i get started then

3
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:26,479
yeah good afternoon everybody i have

4
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:29,519
this presentation about

5
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,240
wp which is a web engine based on

6
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:34,239
webkits

7
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,239
and designed for embedded platforms

8
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:38,239
so during the talk i give a short

9
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:41,839
introduction about webkits

10
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:41,839
a very short overview

11
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:45,760
and then i will more focus on

12
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:48,320
applications um

13
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:50,559
how you can use wp in your application

14
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:53,120
what are the use cases for it

15
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:54,800
and um i probably if i have time i'll

16
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:58,559
give a short demo about

17
00:00:54,800 --> 00:01:01,519
something i wrote all right so i'm

18
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:02,959
philipp i'm a repeat reviewer a

19
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:06,640
distributor commuter

20
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,920
and i work for a company based in spain

21
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:11,280
called igalia

22
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:14,159
we are working on cooperative and

23
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:16,320
we are currently about 90 happy

24
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:21,040
egyptians across the world

25
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:21,039
um so what's wp

26
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,880
so it's it's based on webkit which

27
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,798
probably as you know was

28
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:31,759
start a project started by apple as a

29
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:33,680
fork of html around 2004

30
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:36,880
and the main goal for them at the time

31
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:39,280
was to to build safari

32
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:42,399
and since then other people joined the

33
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:44,799
projects or the companies and

34
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:47,680
the community added new parts i will

35
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:47,680
talk about that later

36
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:56,240
so i briefly introduced the webkit to

37
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,360
multi-process architecture on that

38
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,199
diagram you can only

39
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,200
only see two processes but nowadays

40
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,520
there are more there's one about

41
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,200
network nowadays one about storage and

42
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:08,239
this recently introduced

43
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,920
gpu process as well

44
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:11,680
so the application is called the ui

45
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:12,720
processing data architecture and it

46
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,080
communicates with

47
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:19,120
other processes using ipc

48
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,400
and all all the dom passing all the

49
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,879
[Music]

50
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,720
things internal to the web engine are

51
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:28,239
done in those processes

52
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:32,319
like javascript and all those things

53
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:35,519
um so wp is

54
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:38,238
a port aimed for embedded platforms

55
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:39,040
traditionally what kit both are built on

56
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:44,239
top of a

57
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:44,239
toolkit widget a widget request

58
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,238
but this part is a bit special in the

59
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:51,280
sense that it decouples

60
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:54,640
rendering to dedicated

61
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:56,879
what we call rendering back-ends um

62
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,319
that means that it gives more

63
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:59,359
flexibility to the application

64
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:02,480
developers

65
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:04,000
and there's more openness about the the

66
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:07,440
platforms that you can support

67
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:10,720
with using that model so that means that

68
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:14,400
the rendering is different to another

69
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:15,920
part of the the port that is loaded at

70
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,879
runtime basically

71
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,760
and the input events are also handled

72
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:22,679
using that

73
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:24,798
model um

74
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:28,159
[Music]

75
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:30,959
so those rendering back-ends uh

76
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:32,560
usually require a thing called well and

77
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:36,420
egl

78
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:37,760
which is a way for applications to share

79
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:40,879
[Music]

80
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:44,319
graphics resources between processes

81
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:46,720
and there are egl extensions dedicated

82
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:46,720
to that

83
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,679
so there are quite a few back-ends

84
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:54,399
nowadays i will just focus on two

85
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,760
and the first one is the fdo back-end

86
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,840
which i will talk about

87
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:59,040
in a minute and the other one is the rdk

88
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,799
back-end which is

89
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:04,959
developed by companies such as comcast

90
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:05,920
and they have deployed it in a wide

91
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:09,760
range of

92
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:11,790
setup boxes actually in the

93
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:13,760
in the in the world

94
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:18,320
[Music]

95
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:21,199
so the fda backend it depends on ndgl

96
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:22,320
so that means usually if you have a gpu

97
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:24,540
driver that's using

98
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:26,000
messer or probably

99
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:28,560
[Music]

100
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,919
something that provides egl you can have

101
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:33,040
binary drivers

102
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:35,680
um so that that

103
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:37,040
back cam provides a high level api for

104
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:40,160
applications to

105
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:41,199
to be able to get egl images from the

106
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,199
web engine

107
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:44,240
and so they can do whatever they want

108
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:48,080
with that

109
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:49,280
and then that's also what we recommend

110
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:52,000
for the

111
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:53,520
as the wp community it's the back end

112
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,600
used on the billboards

113
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,799
and it's the the back end we use the

114
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:00,160
most currently

115
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:02,160
in a community um

116
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,800
then obviously obviously you need a

117
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:08,160
browser or some kind of application

118
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:11,360
so yeah we are working on a minimalistic

119
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:14,639
browser called cog

120
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:16,479
it depends on the wp backend ldo

121
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:18,560
and it's really minimalistic there's

122
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:20,159
actually no no window depression no

123
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,320
nothing

124
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,199
and single word view although we are

125
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,639
working on

126
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:28,560
multi-webview uh support

127
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:30,800
and it's also can be controlled using

128
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:33,360
the bus so in your application you can

129
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:38,160
like remote control the browser using

130
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:41,440
other applications basically

131
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:44,080
um so

132
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:46,160
but for as a basic you need to have a

133
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,719
while on compositor to be able to run

134
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,400
cog

135
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:51,120
but since recently we we wrote a new

136
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,400
back end

137
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:57,039
that leveraged the the drm architecture

138
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,318
and thus we don't really require a

139
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:01,840
running wayland

140
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:06,000
compositor so that's quite cool

141
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:07,440
because it reduces the the

142
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,360
dependencies that you need for your

143
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,880
application and you

144
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,280
you if you need the full screen

145
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:16,560
application you can use that back and

146
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:20,799
um like kiosks skip the boxes

147
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:24,160
ui any full screen display

148
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:28,160
and then the rendering is done with uh

149
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:29,120
with drl so the the wireless buffers are

150
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:32,400
imported as

151
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:35,840
uh gbm buffer objects and then rendered

152
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,840
using drm

153
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:44,240
i have a small use case for a

154
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:46,720
small showcase for that

155
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,880
it's basically a thing i did in my free

156
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,880
time i i was a bit tired of using

157
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:54,560
quality at home so i wanted to have a

158
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:58,000
minimalistic media center self-contained

159
00:06:54,560 --> 00:07:01,440
so i i've built a webex extension for

160
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,720
wp and that can be loaded at runtime by

161
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:06,560
the word process

162
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:09,759
and in that web extension i i use a

163
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:13,599
upnp library i called

164
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:17,199
libg upnp and

165
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:20,479
the chan is here okay um

166
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:23,039
so i use that library to to discover uh

167
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:24,719
the media servers on the network and

168
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:27,360
then for each server i

169
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,240
modified the dom and add list elements

170
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,120
to the

171
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:33,280
to the html page rendered so i

172
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:36,240
dynamically build a web page based on

173
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:38,080
what's on the network basically

174
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,319
and then i can do video playback with

175
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:44,479
the normal video element

176
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:47,520
let's stand on nowadays in webkit

177
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:49,199
so there's a demo um it's really 30

178
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,479
seconds if you want to look at it on

179
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:52,879
your phone

180
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:53,919
you can scan that code otherwise i can

181
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:57,440
just move on

182
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:59,758
but yeah it's it's an

183
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:03,039
interesting showcase of uh what you can

184
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:03,039
do with cog and um

185
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,919
it gives an overview of really what you

186
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,919
can do

187
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:12,960
[Music]

188
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:14,639
another thing i wanted to discuss about

189
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:17,440
is acute applications

190
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:20,000
um as you probably know qt is used

191
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:23,120
widely used in the industry nowadays

192
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:26,160
and if you have a web engine in your

193
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:29,360
application such as cute webkit or

194
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:30,800
cute web engine nowadays you probably

195
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,640
would like to have an alternative

196
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,880
because qtwork kit is not

197
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:37,519
maintained anymore it has a lot of

198
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:39,599
security issues

199
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:40,959
and some people don't like cute web

200
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:45,120
engine because it's too big

201
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:47,920
uh yeah so this is an alternative to to

202
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:50,160
those two options here

203
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:52,079
so what we did in upstream webkit we've

204
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:55,040
built a qml module

205
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:56,160
that can be swapped in instead of the q2

206
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:59,519
kit based uh

207
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:01,519
qml module so if you have an application

208
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:03,600
using cute webkit you you can directly

209
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:06,480
use that module

210
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,200
and it will use internal awp instead of

211
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,160
like it

212
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:12,000
so what you gain is uh maintain web

213
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:15,040
engine with security

214
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,200
releases and so

215
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,959
in that sense it's quite a good

216
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:22,560
advantage

217
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:25,599
there are some drawbacks though

218
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:28,000
um doesn't it works only on linux so

219
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:31,279
if your application needs to run only

220
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,880
the windows you're a bit screwed

221
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:36,560
and then there's dependency on where you

222
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:37,920
landed in ega but um that we can't

223
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,119
really walk around and it works

224
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:43,120
currently on in the

225
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:44,880
eglfs qpa and while on egl as well

226
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:50,160
so that means it can work on desktop and

227
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:52,160
on embedded platforms

228
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,439
to enable it you just need to download

229
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:57,199
kit webkit uh

230
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,839
wp webkit sorry and turn on that cmake

231
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:01,200
option

232
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:02,880
called enable the wp qt api and then

233
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,519
around time you just need to make sure

234
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,720
that the

235
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:08,560
so file is in your import path and then

236
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:12,399
i have a small

237
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:15,599
code snippet qml snippet there that

238
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:18,640
shows how to basically use that

239
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:20,880
wp view in your application

240
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:22,160
so the changes compared to kit webkit is

241
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:25,600
that you just need to

242
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:26,880
change the import line and uh the module

243
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,200
name it's wp

244
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,240
view but in the q3 kit world i think

245
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,720
it's it's

246
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,920
different name otherwise the api is

247
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,959
similar so

248
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:38,160
on title change here that is already

249
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:41,359
available including

250
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,360
it can be used as it is

251
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,399
all right so and then the last thing i

252
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:49,839
wanted to talk about is

253
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:53,760
how to use wp in multimedia application

254
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:58,399
using this trimmer uh that's a bit of a

255
00:10:53,760 --> 00:11:02,560
novel way um think about

256
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:06,000
streaming bothers or html overlays

257
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:08,359
in live live tv for instance

258
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,720
so that could be a use case for wp um

259
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:12,240
[Music]

260
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,240
just a brief overview of about the

261
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,000
streamer that google hasn't read about

262
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,959
history

263
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,519
nobody yes okay so basically it's a

264
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:24,399
multimedia framework based on

265
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:25,200
graphs so in your application you build

266
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:27,200
a graph

267
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,240
and the data flow will flow from the

268
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,680
source to sync

269
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,399
and there will be data processing like

270
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:34,959
decoding and rendering

271
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:36,720
um there's many many plugins i won't go

272
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:40,399
into details but what i did

273
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:42,560
is write a new plugin that uses wp

274
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:43,180
and i built a source element for that so

275
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,880
that the

276
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:48,319
[Music]

277
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:53,040
the video the webview can be outputted

278
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:53,040
as a video basically as a video stream

279
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:59,839
and it's quite cool because we

280
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:02,480
we have zero copy uh from webkit world

281
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:04,240
into this trimmer wall using the charge

282
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,560
gl context

283
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:08,800
so there's no memory copies in in there

284
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:13,839
and the use cases as i said

285
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:18,240
html overlays and streaming browsers

286
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:20,399
i started so that's a demo i wrote

287
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,399
on the right side you can see some html

288
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:27,279
and on the left side the preview of it

289
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:29,680
with a live live video uh beyond

290
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:31,680
and then you can stream that i can show

291
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:34,079
you show it later maybe

292
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:35,839
and when you update the html it's uh

293
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:38,399
updated in the video of course

294
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:42,160
so that's for like the tv broadcasting

295
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:42,160
world it could be useful for instance

296
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:48,000
um some ongoing work i've been doing

297
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:50,839
lately on that plugin

298
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
adding audio support i've reported type

299
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:53,920
already

300
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,600
i need to upstream it and then

301
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,599
navigation events in this trimmer are

302
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,680
not really

303
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,200
i've been designed many years ago and

304
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,800
needs to be modernized a bit so i

305
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,880
started working on that as well

306
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:06,880
mainly adding uh mouse core support

307
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:10,959
achievements

308
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:10,959
and improving keyboard support as well

309
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:19,359
um so the code is

310
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:22,160
in wp-webkit.org

311
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:24,000
we have a yocto layer the support is

312
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:26,319
upstream in virtual as well

313
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,360
this has been working quite well on imx6

314
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:31,519
amx 8m

315
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,519
platform raspberry pi three and four

316
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:35,440
and it's deployed in the wild already so

317
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:39,439
you can use it

318
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:41,839
now i guess i have time for the movie

319
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,839
i can

320
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,000
okay

321
00:13:47,440 --> 00:14:03,839
if it works

322
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:17,839
um

323
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,600
okay it doesn't work but uh

324
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:41,199
but yeah but you can start it with

325
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:41,599
uh there's a flat pack available and you

326
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:44,399
can

327
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,760
install it quite easily on your desktop

328
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:50,800
i can provide the

329
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:59,839
flat pack ref in later on if needed

330
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:59,839
but i don't have it in state here sorry

331
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:07,519
no it's not working anyway

332
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:13,839
so yeah that's it if you have any

333
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:13,839
questions i will be happy to answer

334
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:25,029
[Applause]

335
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:35,600
yes the question

336
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:40,399
is so how's platform support i've seen

337
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:43,839
some support for imx6 i'm excited right

338
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:46,639
uh anything kind new and notable in that

339
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:47,199
sorry can you anything new and notable

340
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:50,240
from like

341
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:52,719
platforms supported by wpe
