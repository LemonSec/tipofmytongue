1
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,639
so good evening everyone

2
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:14,719
welcome to the latest and one of the

3
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:17,359
safest if not the safest

4
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:18,320
presentation this evening so just make

5
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:21,439
sure

6
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:24,800
i'm putting the device here uh

7
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:25,840
let's close it a bit so that we get a

8
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,560
nice

9
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:30,160
better way and if i was you know long

10
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,799
enough i can probably put it on the wall

11
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,719
also

12
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,160
but i'll just put it here the talk will

13
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:36,640
be about this device

14
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,839
it's a device with open source software

15
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,680
hardware

16
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,440
done from a software and engineer that

17
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,680
has no idea about hardware

18
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:46,320
and it will be more information about my

19
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:48,800
journey the tools that i used

20
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,079
mistakes that i made and hopefully you

21
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:53,559
can learn from this

22
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:55,680
so please don't smoke in that direction

23
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:57,120
[Laughter]

24
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,600
yeah most of the times for your

25
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:01,760
convenience i put also qr codes so you

26
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,760
can just scan it or

27
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,600
on the fosdem website you can see also

28
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:08,479
the slides

29
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,960
and you can see the same contenders here

30
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:10,720
okay

31
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,640
so what i'll be talking about is i'll be

32
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:15,039
talking about our dream

33
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,840
what we wanted to achieve how we

34
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,759
actually

35
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,600
started with this idea usually a dream

36
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:23,040
has some motivation

37
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:24,720
then i'll be talking about the team

38
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,479
i'll be talking about the creation of

39
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:29,920
the device itself

40
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:33,039
and then i'll open the door for

41
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:34,400
more people to join and more things to

42
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,240
improve

43
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,680
one of the things when you start working

44
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,079
with

45
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,200
open source projects be it software

46
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:43,839
hardware

47
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,759
it's a never-ending task you can always

48
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,000
improve some small thing here and there

49
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:50,320
you can always do something better

50
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,200
and there is always somebody that will

51
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:55,039
tell you this

52
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:58,320
and hopefully will help us okay

53
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:00,719
so um it's a it's a

54
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,360
long story but i'll try to make it a bit

55
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:05,199
short

56
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:09,758
and my family

57
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:12,720
has a vacation home which is

58
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:14,399
not quite often used and we thought

59
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,680
would it be possible we have still

60
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,480
neighbors there but they're a bit far

61
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,200
away

62
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,480
to have a device that can inform us via

63
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,679
wi-fi

64
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:25,599
if there is a smoke you know if this

65
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,480
thing starts to burn we have to inform

66
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:29,040
somebody

67
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,720
the neighbors are away but we can if we

68
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,679
receive some information we can just

69
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:35,120
call them

70
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:37,680
and hopefully save further troubles

71
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,920
also the fire brigade will come and all

72
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,840
will be good and we started talking with

73
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:45,119
my niece and with the other part

74
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,800
of the family but what about when the

75
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,040
cleaning lady comes wouldn't it be

76
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,319
nice if we have some information if

77
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:53,120
somebody answered

78
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:53,839
and then what about when we are not here

79
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,519
would it be

80
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,879
nice to if if somebody entered the house

81
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:01,120
without permission

82
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:02,480
just to have an alarm so that the

83
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,800
neighbors can hear this

84
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,840
and probably you know check what's

85
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,200
happening in there

86
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,959
and things like that and we started

87
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,159
discussing a lot of situations for

88
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:11,840
example

89
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:13,840
now we're here with the kids and we

90
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,519
don't want all this beeping and sending

91
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:19,280
information via

92
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:21,840
via wi-fi to somewhere

93
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,959
can we have just this mode that we hear

94
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,599
in some of the small

95
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:27,360
shops the ones that are almost gone

96
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:29,440
where you enter and you see

97
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,200
beep beep beep and you know the kids are

98
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,000
here or somebody just entered and you

99
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:36,640
can

100
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:39,680
walk and so on you have this device

101
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:42,399
is having motion detection

102
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,760
it's having also smoke detection it's

103
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,879
having some other parts that i'll be

104
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,959
talking about

105
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:47,920
and we wanted to create such a device

106
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:51,280
and

107
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:53,359
so we know that such

108
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,360
at that time such devices existed but

109
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,400
for a price range that was not quite

110
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,560
good

111
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,159
um for example as the price of this one

112
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:04,000
at the moment and

113
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:04,879
um as a software engineer and a person

114
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,920
who

115
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:09,439
um who is a big fan of open source i

116
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,399
started to think can we make something

117
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:12,640
like this

118
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,439
can i make with a team something like

119
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:17,199
this

120
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:21,120
uh but so first i want to improve the

121
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:24,320
security of my house but i want to

122
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:27,120
you know to be i at that time knew

123
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:28,240
that i would not be really able to do

124
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,600
all parts

125
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:34,960
so i wanted to use the open source

126
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:36,960
development way

127
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,159
and to give the freedom for somebody

128
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,400
else to improve it

129
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,320
to add another functionality maybe you

130
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,520
already have an idea what functionality

131
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:46,560
this can be

132
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:49,198
and uh in addition

133
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,000
to allow us to uh legally to to an

134
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:53,440
extent

135
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:56,639
to modify this and use it for our needs

136
00:04:53,440 --> 00:05:00,719
and last but not least

137
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:03,759
so i knew that it's possible

138
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:07,280
to create a device just bunch of wires

139
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:09,360
plug it but we wanted something

140
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,559
some like finished product we wanted to

141
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:15,199
have a box

142
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:17,919
we wanted to have all things covered

143
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:19,440
easy to assemble disassemble just put it

144
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:21,758
there and use it

145
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,759
and

146
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,560
so i was quite open for all the ideas

147
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,440
and i thought why not why not give it a

148
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,560
try

149
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:33,280
maybe we will succeed and do something

150
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,560
so i'll present to the team that's the

151
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,359
initial team there are also other

152
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,960
contributors

153
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:41,360
small and big one let me present myself

154
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,560
i'm the software engineer over there i'm

155
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,919
the person who knows

156
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:48,720
how software works computer languages

157
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:50,159
uh i'm quite skewed in some and it's

158
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,039
relatively

159
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,800
not easy but straightforward to to

160
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:55,840
switch to another language i know that i

161
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,080
need

162
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:59,440
some short time span to switch to

163
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:02,400
another language

164
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:04,160
let's say two months maybe six months to

165
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,239
become good

166
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:09,039
a year or two to become really good and

167
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:12,720
a lot of years to be expert

168
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:16,318
after that uh we have a hardware guy so

169
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:20,080
i don't do hardware i

170
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:23,199
saw the the wrong pins

171
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,680
so the hardware guy is a really skilled

172
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:27,039
and

173
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:28,319
patient guy and for him really assembly

174
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:31,360
is a high level language

175
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:33,280
so he is looking at the bytes he can

176
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:35,440
measure

177
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:38,479
he can measure the batteries by by their

178
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:40,639
weight so we are talking about some

179
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:42,240
other reality for me i i didn't know

180
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:45,280
that such people exist

181
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:48,080
then we have uh um a designer

182
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:49,440
who is actually a really really famous

183
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,919
good designer he has

184
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,960
if you know this red dot awards he has

185
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:55,198
four of them

186
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:57,680
i'm told that this is like the oscars of

187
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:59,599
uh of the design industry and he has

188
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,440
four of them

189
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:02,880
accidentally he goes also to the

190
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:05,840
mountains and we met there

191
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:08,000
and also there is a fourth guy who is

192
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:12,560
the mechanical guy who makes all the

193
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:14,880
nice graphs and so on and

194
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:17,280
some of you may ask yourself why four

195
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:20,240
guys can you just make this

196
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,239
thing yourself

197
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,758
i thought the same i thought the same

198
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:26,479
why why really

199
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:27,440
maybe i'll not do something like a good

200
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:29,919
design but

201
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:31,360
something acceptable so no design is

202
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:34,719
needed

203
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:37,280
mechanical designer i used to

204
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,960
change the first example from blender

205
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,318
that should be enough also to make

206
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,960
mechanical design

207
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:44,000
and then for the hardware i had a

208
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:47,280
brilliant plan

209
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
one week expert in hardware i asked my

210
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,799
good friends

211
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,560
and they told me you have to buy the art

212
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,520
of electronics if i'm not mistaken from

213
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,479
horowitz

214
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:58,159
read it get these components and see how

215
00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:00,400
it goes if you burn all of them

216
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,360
then it's not good and i started really

217
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,599
for a week to

218
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,440
to solder and so on i got distracted

219
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:08,479
burn my first component

220
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:09,840
then i think even before the end of the

221
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:12,159
week i knew that i

222
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:14,318
if i want to be expert in this if i want

223
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:16,319
to be good in this it will take at least

224
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:19,599
two and a half years full time

225
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:22,639
and i had only two two hours a day

226
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:26,400
free time even less so

227
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:27,039
at some point i i knew i hope quite soon

228
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,239
that

229
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:33,199
things will not go with one person

230
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:34,399
if one of you here is a genius and i saw

231
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,800
some geniuses

232
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:37,519
then definitely you can do it yourself

233
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:40,880
but

234
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:43,919
what uh when we create something

235
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:46,560
we need to be experts in different areas

236
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:47,600
so if i started as a kid probably also

237
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,719
to do 3d

238
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:53,440
3d design hardware maybe i could do it

239
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,480
unfortunately i started with software so

240
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,080
and also

241
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,680
there is a communication there is

242
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,360
understanding about some properties

243
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:02,000
there are requirements

244
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:03,120
that i have never ever knew for example

245
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,240
that the plastics

246
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:08,320
depending on the plastics it can uh and

247
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,839
depending on the technology you have to

248
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,920
put additional spacing

249
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:13,040
otherwise the machine cannot exactly up

250
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:15,360
to the millimeter

251
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,880
do whatever you want and things like

252
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:20,000
this and

253
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:21,040
if i was doing this probably after 25

254
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,360
years or when i

255
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,719
retire i have enough time to finish it

256
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:28,000
but for me

257
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:29,200
that was not quite good but let's go to

258
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,120
the requirements now

259
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:36,160
i thought okay we have a team i have

260
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,200
very good requirements so it needs to

261
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:40,800
have this motion

262
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:42,640
and smoke detector that's fine

263
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,240
in the beginning because i met some

264
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,519
people and i said hey i made a motion

265
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,279
detection and i

266
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:49,120
another person who said i have made a

267
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:51,839
very low efficient

268
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:53,760
smoke detection okay let's let's try to

269
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:55,519
use it one of them said i am perfectly

270
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:58,720
fine to be open source the other one

271
00:09:55,519 --> 00:10:00,720
was not quite interested so

272
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,160
uh we wanted to have a nice and polished

273
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,519
look we didn't want to look something

274
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:06,000
like something that is already in the

275
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:08,480
market okay here is the

276
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,040
star designer he can help us with this

277
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,839
um

278
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:13,279
to work on batteries so this thing

279
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,880
because we are not that often and the

280
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:18,399
neighbors they are not also that

281
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:20,160
often should last for a year hopefully

282
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:21,760
for a year we'll go there we'll be able

283
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:24,399
to change the batteries if something

284
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:26,560
goes wrong and so on to be remotely

285
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:29,600
upgradable

286
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:33,518
why well there is security problems

287
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:35,440
every day the wi-fi stack

288
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:37,120
problem so you update the version some

289
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,079
other problem you want new functionality

290
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,240
not just problem

291
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:42,239
so you constantly want to be upgradable

292
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:45,519
and to be open source and now

293
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:47,440
when i say open source here i wanted to

294
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,880
so i was the one responsible for the

295
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,839
software so it would be open source

296
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,439
software

297
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:53,440
but we wanted to be also open source

298
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:57,680
hardware so you can

299
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:59,839
really uh produce this device

300
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:02,560
just having the specifications the pcbs

301
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:03,360
the old schematics and everything up to

302
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,680
the last

303
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,440
component plus the link from the website

304
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:10,560
where you can buy the component

305
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,519
and i just wanted somebody else to help

306
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:15,279
and to improve it

307
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:18,560
and hopefully to come with good ideas um

308
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:19,439
as a normal open software open source

309
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:22,399
software works

310
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,880
so i had initially also an idea to

311
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:26,640
create

312
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:29,279
all of this using open source tools

313
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:30,319
but i met a resistance from all the

314
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:33,680
people

315
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:36,320
because they were skilled in this tool

316
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:37,040
and they didn't want to try another one

317
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,519
or it

318
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,079
will hinder their creativity so most of

319
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:41,920
the people

320
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:43,439
are quite creative so i made a

321
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:45,360
compromise that okay

322
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:47,120
let's make it like this do whatever you

323
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,279
want use whatever you want to

324
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,399
but at the end the final result should

325
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:52,399
be viewable

326
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:53,760
modifiable from open source tools and

327
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:57,680
i'll try to take care

328
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:59,920
to to find the tools so

329
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:02,160
now we're coming to this device this is

330
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:06,240
the u-kit device

331
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:10,000
and as you can see it has this

332
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:11,920
look you can put some batteries here it

333
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,040
works with the same batteries like the

334
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:18,079
famous uh cigars

335
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:18,959
e-cigars e-cigarettes and so on and it

336
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:21,680
has different

337
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:22,160
modes we decided to go only for four of

338
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,239
them

339
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:25,360
so we can detect smoke that's the

340
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,360
initial mode and then

341
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,800
you trigger an alarm there are also

342
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,000
modes where you can detect smoke and

343
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,760
detection

344
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,040
be informed over the internet don't be

345
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:38,000
informed of the internet

346
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:40,800
or just turn the um

347
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,200
uh silence uh the buzzer so it doesn't

348
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,639
uh

349
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:47,200
sunk a lot and there was a

350
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:48,880
also another requirement the people if

351
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:51,600
if somebody enters in your house

352
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:52,160
it's probably quite skilled guy so this

353
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,360
device

354
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:58,719
had to wake up for one second

355
00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:01,279
second and a half maximum to wake up to

356
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,880
send an mqtt message to somewhere over

357
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:04,240
ssl that's what i thought in the

358
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:08,880
beginning

359
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:12,399
and finish i talked with the um

360
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:15,519
with the developer with the hardware guy

361
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:16,399
and um he told me well good good

362
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:17,839
thinking but

363
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:21,839
the way you want it well it's not

364
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:21,839
possible first

365
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:27,439
with so i said let's let's use esp i

366
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:30,638
know this

367
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,440
it's quite nice easy to program very fun

368
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:34,880
thing

369
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:37,440
and the the device

370
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:39,040
uh most of the places you see it's uh

371
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:41,519
low consumption and so on

372
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,240
for one year it will not last probably a

373
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:45,920
week

374
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:48,399
so we we uh the hardware guy

375
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:49,599
informed me that we need a second

376
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:53,600
microcontroller

377
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:56,720
and this is a tiny 1634

378
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,279
really ultra low power consumption you

379
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:01,440
can see

380
00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:03,040
some of the hardware specifications here

381
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,120
so we ended up with actually three

382
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:08,480
controllers microcontrollers

383
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:13,120
uh esp8266 for the wi-fi

384
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:13,760
atini 1634 where the main logic is going

385
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,279
on

386
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:17,120
and we ended up with allegro

387
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:17,760
microcontroller which is for the

388
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,079
processing

389
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:21,199
of the smoke but this one doesn't need

390
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:24,560
to be programmed

391
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:26,959
the the device um looks like this now

392
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:28,000
in the source code is uh and the

393
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:30,880
repository

394
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,639
is divided into different sum parts and

395
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:34,560
uh if you go to this url

396
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:35,680
you see all the neither things in order

397
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,920
to print this

398
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:40,560
you need in order to print the pcb all

399
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:42,240
the needed components to to solder them

400
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:44,959
of course you have to buy them and to

401
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:48,880
create the device but

402
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:51,920
um what we

403
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:55,120
achieved is

404
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:57,279
a form factor that is easy to assemble

405
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:59,519
not exactly small as a device i was

406
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:00,639
thinking about a really small device but

407
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:05,199
then you end up in a

408
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:08,079
station where you cannot buy this

409
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:09,599
commodity components for cheap so that's

410
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:13,439
what we have here

411
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:16,160
and we used couple of tools

412
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:18,800
now the hardware design i was very again

413
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:20,639
very patient guy and actually quite uh

414
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:22,160
interested in learning new things so we

415
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:25,600
started using kycat

416
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:27,360
most of you know it quite a good tool

417
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:29,600
multiple problems that we had for

418
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:31,360
example i'm working on linux and he was

419
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,360
working on windows and constantly we had

420
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:35,759
to do something with the paths

421
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,480
after that some things were missing and

422
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:38,320
and so on

423
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,160
those of you that worked with kat and

424
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:42,160
worked only uh on

425
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:43,519
one platform let's say windows they were

426
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:46,240
probably quite fun

427
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:47,680
but we discovered some things that we

428
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,839
didn't know and were difficult to

429
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:52,560
explain after that we used other tools

430
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:53,680
for example uh when i say can you move

431
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,839
this whole

432
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,800
you know five centimeters in that

433
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:59,199
direction

434
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:01,599
and he says i did it here is the file

435
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:03,279
i'd like to see visual difference

436
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,519
i'm a software engineer i'm used to you

437
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:07,519
know differing tools that compare text

438
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:09,440
and in text you can quite easily see

439
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:11,199
this but

440
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,720
here when we're talking about pcbs it's

441
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:16,000
a bit different so

442
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:18,800
what we used is this tool

443
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,240
the second one from the top and this one

444
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,079
can give you

445
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:24,000
quite nice differences you can see we've

446
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:26,880
read where the new change

447
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,000
things and you can integrate all the

448
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,920
things

449
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,279
we have also other tools listed for

450
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,560
example for the difference in the

451
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:35,040
schematics and so on

452
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:36,000
so that the person like me a software

453
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,680
engineer can understand

454
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,519
what's happening and if you go out to

455
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:42,800
this address uh

456
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:44,079
the last one address you'll be able to

457
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,839
see all the tools that we use

458
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:48,000
and this helped me really a lot because

459
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:50,320
when i say to the designer can you

460
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,839
on a hardware guy can you do this he

461
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,639
makes it after that he comes to me he

462
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:55,920
says i did it

463
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:59,360
that said happy you are quite happy

464
00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:03,120
so after that uh for the enclosure

465
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:05,280
um so the mechanical designer and

466
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,720
the designer they use their own tools

467
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:10,480
but we ended up with

468
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:12,480
step files or some easy to

469
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,839
open from freecad files and we use

470
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:16,240
freecad daily

471
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:17,918
the latest and greatest versions in

472
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:19,359
order to be able really to work and to

473
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:21,760
understand what's happening

474
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:24,319
now when when i received the first

475
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:28,000
design i was so excited that i started

476
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:30,559
you know doing um prototyping with

477
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,480
this stereo form and then i presented it

478
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:35,200
to the

479
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,520
designer he looked quite suspicious with

480
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,760
me

481
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,879
he said are you going to produce this

482
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:42,160
with an axe

483
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:44,400
and a hammer i said why why

484
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:46,799
because this needs to be millimeter

485
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,840
exact this needs to be absolutely exact

486
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,440
you cannot just

487
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:51,439
have two or three millimeters you don't

488
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:54,559
have too much room to to do this

489
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:55,280
and then uh after a bit of research uh

490
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:59,039
we found

491
00:17:55,280 --> 00:18:02,000
the cat step-up tool which is

492
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:03,760
an add-on which for free cat it allows

493
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,720
us to get the pcb as it is

494
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:07,600
directly put it in strike and three cat

495
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,520
and see

496
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:11,199
how it looks like so we didn't put all

497
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,760
the components because at that time

498
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,840
khaki

499
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:15,440
didn't have all the components we just

500
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:18,080
put the most bulky ones

501
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:19,600
or we created some of the bulky ones

502
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,399
that we have an idea about the

503
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,159
measurements

504
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:25,760
here things are quite close to each

505
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:28,880
other and then we used also another tool

506
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:32,000
which is this exploded assembly

507
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:34,320
the exploded assembly is uh

508
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,039
nothing really that helps you to develop

509
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,600
faster

510
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:39,280
but it gives some nice pictures and

511
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:41,120
impressions for the people that want to

512
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:42,240
see what what your device is doing and

513
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,399
how to open it

514
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:46,240
so i have here a video i don't know if

515
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,940
this will work probably not

516
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:50,160
but yeah there is a link

517
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:53,280
[Laughter]

518
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:55,600
so when you open the video you see that

519
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:56,960
this starts to open up in all directions

520
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,799
looks pretty nice

521
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:00,400
and you get a good idea and this is

522
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:01,039
something that the commercial tools also

523
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,760
can do

524
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:05,360
and suddenly open source tool is

525
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:07,360
allowing you to

526
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,799
really see this and understand how the

527
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:11,600
things are working

528
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:12,639
so i was quite happy with with the tools

529
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:15,918
that are available

530
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:18,960
for creating the plastic enclosure

531
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:22,000
okay now about the software

532
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:24,400
um the software

533
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,480
the hardware and the enclosure there

534
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:28,400
were no

535
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,840
so there were problems with the tools

536
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,200
and so on but it was relatively

537
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:33,280
straightforward and hardware doesn't

538
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:36,720
move so fast like software

539
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:37,440
in software especially open source

540
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,000
software

541
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,880
it has one big advantage and one big

542
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,360
disadvantage

543
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:45,120
the open source software is moving quite

544
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:47,360
fast and it changes quite often

545
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:49,840
and breaks things that's the advantage

546
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:52,399
and do you know what the disadvantage

547
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:54,480
the same thing the same thing it can

548
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:59,200
turn against you when you use it

549
00:19:54,480 --> 00:20:00,720
so i started uh working on the software

550
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:03,039
and on the bottom you can see that there

551
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:06,880
are two things that were crossed out

552
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:08,879
so we wanted to put on not only the

553
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:12,159
firmware but to create a mobile app

554
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:15,520
based on uh some tool that can create

555
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:17,520
multiple versions for ios uh

556
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:19,520
android phones and so on make the web

557
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:22,400
api and so on

558
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:24,559
and i started to thank you one at some

559
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:27,600
point they moved to angular 2 and then

560
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:31,280
ionic decided to use typescript and

561
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:34,320
ah hell hell on earth

562
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:37,440
this is unsupportable at the

563
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:38,639
node.js they they sort of don't move

564
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:42,240
that fast

565
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:44,159
but still let's say i used version 4 to

566
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:48,400
create the web api and then suddenly

567
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:50,159
version 8 and then 9 and 10 and simple

568
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:52,240
small things i want just you know to

569
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:53,919
make a call to receive it why you have

570
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:56,880
to constantly change the api

571
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:58,640
and so on so that was a big pain point

572
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,320
for us and we gave up of this

573
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:02,000
if somebody is interested in working

574
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,879
with this and quite skilled and he can

575
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,760
help us but

576
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:07,280
we concentrated on the software for the

577
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,640
two microcontrollers

578
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:10,399
since i started from the bottom i'll

579
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:12,720
continue from the bottom the atini

580
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:14,320
software

581
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:17,440
and this microcontroller you don't have

582
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:18,480
much space there is a tiny space in

583
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:22,080
there

584
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:25,200
to achieve this one second

585
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:28,480
response sending it over the internet

586
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:29,520
using ssl connecting to the point and so

587
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,679
on

588
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,799
you have to optimize on every level and

589
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:35,760
the hardware

590
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:37,440
guy said well you use assembler we can

591
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:39,280
fit in this space and so on

592
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:41,520
and he not only fit in the space that he

593
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:42,720
was leaving even some additional space

594
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:45,280
and i thought hmm

595
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:46,559
i can put the bootloader there because i

596
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:49,440
want not only to update

597
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:51,280
the esp i want to update the tuning so

598
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:53,679
we had we ended up with

599
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:55,039
a slightly modified version of tinysave

600
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:58,640
bootloader

601
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:59,760
and it worked quite nicely for the esp

602
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:02,559
part

603
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:04,799
we used um a swing framework and i

604
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:07,200
suddenly ended up as the

605
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:08,559
release manager and co contributor of

606
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:11,360
swing framework so

607
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:12,720
what i needed is i was needing something

608
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:15,678
i thought quite simple

609
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:16,880
i need mqtt protocol simple if nobody

610
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:20,559
created it i'll create

611
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:23,520
a client for this plus uh

612
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:23,840
ssl connection to this thing plus a bit

613
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,240
of

614
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:28,080
fingerprinting so that suddenly that i

615
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:31,600
don't send to somebody else

616
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:36,799
and it took quite some

617
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:40,000
years to reach this 1.5 seconds

618
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:42,080
execution you can i started

619
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,600
using for example on arduino and i

620
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:45,199
thought that would work they have

621
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:48,399
everything

622
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:52,000
after five six ten seconds you may

623
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:53,600
may succeed not exactly what i want i

624
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,760
want this to succeed always

625
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:57,520
plus the second component and we have

626
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:58,879
the big component and probably i'll go

627
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:01,440
to a more detailed

628
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:03,520
chart ah that's not here uh we had jerry

629
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:06,640
script just scripted there

630
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:10,639
it's a it's a javascript language

631
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:14,240
and what i had there is uh

632
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:17,360
if somebody we have all these events

633
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:20,000
smoke uh movement and so on

634
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:20,879
if somebody wants why not give him the

635
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,080
chance

636
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:25,039
to program additional rules directly on

637
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:27,918
this device

638
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:28,559
white has to go to a service somewhere

639
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:30,159
in

640
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:32,000
somewhere in the world in the states or

641
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:35,120
somewhere in europe

642
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,320
then do something and come back to me i

643
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:40,000
find that this not

644
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:42,320
exactly optimal so javascript was the

645
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,640
tool that we used to help us to

646
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:45,840
implement this logic additional logic

647
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:48,640
now

648
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:50,399
um i'm coming also to the closing so i

649
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:51,520
hope i have one or two minutes for

650
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:54,480
questions

651
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:55,039
um i wanted to answer this question is

652
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,760
it

653
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:59,039
possible is it possible to create open

654
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:02,640
source hardware and smoke

655
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:05,360
detector and make it really

656
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:06,720
also modifiable with open source tools

657
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:10,320
and so on

658
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:14,400
for me the answer was yes yes

659
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:16,080
uh was it easy no

660
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,919
now if you start working with open

661
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:19,678
source tools you have to understand this

662
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:22,880
they change

663
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:26,400
and you learn something it breaks you

664
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:28,000
you end up modifying so many things

665
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,840
uh that at some point you have to stop

666
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:34,159
and say hey i cannot

667
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:37,760
now fix angularjs this is too much

668
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:41,840
and but but it was fun

669
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:44,640
it was great fun i learned a lot and

670
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:46,080
i think we spent most of the difficult

671
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,840
years of developing

672
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:50,399
all the difficult times of developing a

673
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:52,720
hardware project

674
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:54,320
and they're behind us so now we can only

675
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:56,400
upgrade it and make it better

676
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:58,240
are we done yet that the kids that's

677
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:00,799
what my kids usually ask me when i

678
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:02,320
when i start putting them in the car and

679
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:03,520
after five minutes are we there are we

680
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:05,600
done yet

681
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:06,879
eighty percent eighty percent i can

682
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,799
flash it

683
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:10,880
and then configure it and manually and

684
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:11,679
it will work perfectly fine for even two

685
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,120
years

686
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:15,360
but we need the twenty percent to

687
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:17,520
attract more more normal people so

688
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:19,600
no flashing and so on so we have

689
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:22,000
actually a lot of work

690
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:24,080
a lot of work so if somebody is now

691
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,559
having a lot of free time wants to join

692
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:28,320
us

693
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:30,000
please join us we have documentation

694
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,760
that needs to be finished i'm not

695
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,760
giving this to you i know that most of

696
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,720
the software and how the people don't

697
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:37,120
want to but

698
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,840
we need to improve here and there

699
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:40,479
something we

700
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:42,158
hope that we can decrease the the size

701
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:46,000
the form size and so on

702
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:48,480
and um yeah such projects

703
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,279
um they develop constantly they need

704
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:53,120
your help

705
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:57,360
so if you want to help

706
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:59,918
there is a url and

707
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:02,479
usually i'm asked this are you ready for

708
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:06,240
mass production

709
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:08,320
maybe an axe and a chisel we can do it

710
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:09,279
i actually went to portugal especially

711
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:12,000
to ask the

712
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:12,880
european mecca of plastic enclosure

713
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,679
producers

714
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:17,919
they had a price very good one double

715
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:19,760
the chinese but still a good one

716
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:21,039
plus they said the weather is good you

717
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:23,520
can enjoy the weather

718
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:25,840
now i hope i have some time for

719
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,840
questions

720
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:31,600
two minutes for questions is it possible

721
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:40,559
okay so the question was is it possible

722
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:43,600
to print this on a

723
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:46,158
3d printer with fdm technology

724
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,799
yes it is possible because we started

725
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:49,200
actually

726
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:50,320
printing it on such printers and we were

727
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:53,360
always getting

728
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:54,320
some problems from uh the pre the

729
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:56,240
printing houses

730
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:58,080
and they said finally okay make this a

731
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,039
bit bigger make this a bit smaller you

732
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:02,480
can print it

733
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:02,480
and we have also yeah

734
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:09,840
so so uh uh now if you are if you are

735
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:12,039
standing please sit

736
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:13,918
at the moment this thing costs around

737
00:27:12,039 --> 00:27:17,120
250.

738
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:20,559
this is uh unique euros

739
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:24,239
euros in europe so turkish leaders

740
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:25,200
before now of course the plastic

741
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:28,399
enclosure is

742
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:30,960
the one that is costing 210 maybe

743
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:32,479
all the rest is the components and the

744
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:35,679
manual

745
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:37,360
configuring and so on actually uh if we

746
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:40,960
start mass producing

747
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:44,879
we can go to a price below 40 even

748
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:45,679
um 40 euros which is sort of competitive

749
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:49,440
price for me

750
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:51,440
25 will be the best but yeah

751
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:53,440
other questions yeah i just had one over

752
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:54,880
here can i actually use that in my house

753
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:57,120
as a smoke detector

754
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:58,399
is that certified very good question no

755
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,918
that's not certified

756
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:01,439
it's not certified it's a it's a

757
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:03,760
companion

758
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:05,200
that you can use for certification we

759
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:07,679
need to invest

760
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:08,240
so first um when you when you certify

761
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:09,440
something

762
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:11,440
uh you have to be sure that the

763
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:13,520
enclosure is final and

764
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,720
the software is more or less final right

765
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:16,080
well the new standards for smoke

766
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:17,039
detectors because i'm perfectly involved

767
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:20,480
in that industry

768
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:23,039
is 10 years on a single battery 10 years

769
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:24,240
10 years and you you need to

770
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:25,440
discriminate

771
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:27,279
you need to be able to discriminate

772
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:28,720
nuisance alarms versus real smoke if a

773
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:31,760
hamburger is starting to burn

774
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:33,919
your alarm cannot go off so

775
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:36,158
yes yes this is so as a hard as a

776
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:39,120
hardware guy that last 20 percent takes

777
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:39,120
80 percent of the time

778
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:44,799
that it's the same it's absolutely the

779
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:48,000
same as the software guy

780
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:48,000
okay another question

781
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:50,480
do we have

782
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,159
yeah over there

783
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:59,120
how do you take taking a look at the

784
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:01,918
other projects in a

785
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:02,799
similar space i i think of one from

786
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:07,200
stuttgart

787
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:13,840
uh dealing with um fine dust detection

788
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:13,840
uh the project is called lufthan or air

789
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:20,240
and so maybe you could

790
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,159
learn how they did things and how they

791
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:25,279
approach those things

792
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:26,159
so we started quite quite a long time

793
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:28,480
ago maybe

794
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:30,000
four or five years ago you know i have

795
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:31,919
only two and a half hours and

796
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,360
two hours i need to feed the kids and

797
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:36,559
then 15 minutes to

798
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:39,360
for my uh i'm living actually

799
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:41,360
close to stuttgart uh for at the time

800
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:43,199
when we started of course we researched

801
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:45,120
there is another project we couldn't

802
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,480
find such a project that we wanted so we

803
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:48,399
decided to do it ourselves

804
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:50,080
typical for software for open source you

805
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:53,039
know typical

806
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:54,080
um but i would love to connect with the

807
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:56,480
people and probably

808
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:57,279
we can exchange some ideas and probably

809
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:59,279
they'll give me

810
00:29:57,279 --> 00:30:01,520
hints i am i only can give heads for

811
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:04,000
software

812
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:05,679
okay so i think we run out of time so

813
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:09,840
thank you for our last speaker

814
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:09,840
thank you

815
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:16,720
one of the safest presentations you will

816
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:17,600
save here so unfortunately the time has

817
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:19,360
come

818
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:23,840
and that was the last presentation in

819
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:23,840
the embedded dev room in this year
