1
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,520
are more

2
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:09,280
coming from the performance side and now

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:10,959
we have a developer coming into

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,559
performance so that's it's super

5
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,160
interesting i think and she will talk

6
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:17,198

engineer i

20
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,440

00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,079
technologies and i come more from the

28
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,199
industry side

teach at conferences i teach workshops

31
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:11,199
on performance but i also actually build

32
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,400
web applications and web really is my

33
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,960
bread and butter

34
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,799
these are the slides um at bitly font

35
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:18,158
dash perf lower case

36
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,799
you can find these slides so you don't

37
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:24,400
have to scramble to copy anything down

38
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:26,640
or take screenshots they are deployed in

39
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:31,200
the web so all these links are clickable

40
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:32,799
um yeah you ready to get started

41
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,400
so i want to pull the audience really

42
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,479
quick um

43
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,159
how many of you are super passionate

44
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:39,920
about web performance and you're like a

45
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,560
wonk you're like really into like this

46
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:45,040
the weeds and the tech

47
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,680
there's a lot of you here um how many of

48
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,000
you

49
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,720
are you think performance is great and

50
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,399
you love it

51
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,439
um but you're you know a developer and

52
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:53,119
you're still learning and you're in that

53
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:56,559
process

54
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:58,560
yay there's lots of you and um

55
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:02,079
how many of you are curious but not yet

56
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:06,399
convinced that performance is important

57
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:08,120
okay and then the rest of you

58
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:11,840
why are you here

59
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:13,200
[Laughter]

60
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,720
but it's good to know i like to know my

61
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,839
audience because i'm going to adjust

62
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,080
this a little bit

63
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,920
um i don't think we need this section

64
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,879
because i think most of you care about

65
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,958
performance

66
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:24,239
so we're just going to jump right in but

67
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:25,760
what about typography because i'm

68
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:26,720
talking about fonts here so i'm just

69
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,959
going to take a

70
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,160
super quick side thing and talk about

71
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:32,560
typography

72
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,680
so typography is what language looks

73
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,319
like

74
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:38,000
it communicates content is king like the

75
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:40,319
words are king

76
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,840
but typography still makes a difference

77
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:44,319
and if you don't understand that let's

78
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,800
look at these few slides

79
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:48,238
so think to yourself what does this

80
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,640
evoke in you

81
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:53,360
i'm going to go back and forth that's

82
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:56,238
just one word hello

83
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,239
oops wrong way

84
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,920
versus this what are these do these

85
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:05,599
things evoke different feelings

86
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:07,440
in you maybe this one's like

87
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:11,839
it's more out there it's friendlier it's

88
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,840
open it's trustworthy as a slab font

89
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:17,760
the next one is maybe a little quieter

90
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:19,599
but it's also all cats so it's a little

91
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:22,159
confusing is it yelling at me but it's

92
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:24,879
italicized so

93
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:25,840
um i know most of you are not americans

94
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:28,079
um

95
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,120
but these fonts this is all the same

96
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,080
word right new york

97
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:33,360
new york new york i feel like i should

98
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:36,319
have started singing the song

99
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:38,959
but um but each of these evokes a

100
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:40,879
different feeling in me

101
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:42,159
because i'm also it's like brand

102
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:43,679
recognition so it's like

103
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:46,399
associated with the publications that

104
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,400
they are from or the sports teams they

105
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:51,760
are used for

106
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:54,640
so typography is still important

107
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,679
but what like when we talk about fonts

108
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,599
in action

109
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,360
in the web and typography what annoys

110
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:00,798
you i like to be interactive so i want

111
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,239
you to shout things at me

112
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:05,599
what is something that annoys you about

113
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:05,599
fonts and performance in the web

114
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:10,239
they are slow when they're slow right

115
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,239
what else

116
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:15,839
special characters yes

117
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:28,479
and like what else about swapping fonts

118
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:31,680
there's something that really annoys me

119
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:32,960
what oh the flash but also like

120
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,639
especially when it like

121
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,159
moves everything and you're like oh my

122
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:38,080
god i was halfway down this article and

123
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,520
i have no idea where i am anymore right

124
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:41,280
like that's annoying

125
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,198
so i'm a web developer but i'm also very

126
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,599
concerned about user experience which is

127
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:46,000
why

128
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,160
i love performance because i want the

129
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,280
users to be happy when they visit a page

130
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,160
and not feel like

131
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:53,520
it's annoying so let's jump right into

132
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,880
case studies

133
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,960
first i'm going to talk about web fonts

134
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:59,680
so like google fonts how many of you use

135
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:02,080
google fonts or something similar yeah

136
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:05,199
we all love them yay

137
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:08,719
um so web fonts um

138
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:10,160
they're hosted on fast and reliable cdns

139
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,360
they also have optimized variants i

140
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,039
don't know if you know this but for

141
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,479
example with google fonts i think open

142
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:15,440
sounds has at least 30 something

143
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:17,840
different variants

144
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,880
that optimize based on um a user's

145
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:22,560
browser

146
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:24,479
so because i don't know if you know but

147
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,080
this is the joy of web development

148
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:28,320
browser differences right

149
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,919
so like safari is not going to render

150
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,440
fonts in the same way that

151
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:33,680
chrome does so this can be a little

152
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:35,520
annoying so it's nice when you use these

153
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:38,000
cdn's because they can you know

154
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:41,359
they can actually serve a more optimized

155
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:44,560
font for that user's browser

156
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:47,600
this this should be an air quote

157
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:50,960
opportunity for shared caching

158
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,960
we'll get back to that in a little bit

159
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:56,639
but we now have control over um foot and

160
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,319
fight a flash of unstylotex and flash of

161
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:59,360
invisible text and we'll talk about that

162
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:01,520
a little later

163
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,039
what are the downsides there's a minimum

164
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,719
of two separate requests

165
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:06,159
i'll talk about why we're going to jump

166
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,000
right into that

167
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,039
you can't use resource hints if you

168
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,440
don't know what those are it's all right

169
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:14,120
i'll tell you what they are

170
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:16,080
and it can't take advantage of h2

171
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:18,319
multiplexing

172
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:20,639
if the server can even prioritize it

173
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:23,759
right and luckily right after my talk

174
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:26,800
robin's going to dive deep into a lot of

175
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:28,880
h2 issues and other things

176
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:31,199
so i know the font's a little small on

177
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:33,039
this our screen's a little small

178
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:35,120
but this is a network profile i'm

179
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:36,639
assuming most of you have seen a network

180
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,160
profile

181
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:40,479
and if not you know it's okay we'll

182
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,160
learn here um

183
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:44,719
so what's in this first line what's the

184
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:47,120
first line always anyways

185
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,319
what what file is that it's like the

186
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,599
page right

187
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:53,080
um the second file uh you can't read it

188
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:54,240
i'll just read it to you it says

189
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:57,520
style.css

190
00:06:54,240 --> 00:07:00,639
right so what do you think that is

191
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,198
stylesheet yeah i know it's a trick

192
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:04,960
question

193
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:08,000
not um the third line

194
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:11,280
it says fonts.googleapis.com

195
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,280
css what is that

196
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,319
it's that call it's that it's what you

197
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:21,440
copy paste from google fonts

198
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:22,639
into either the head or into your style

199
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:25,919
sheet right

200
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:25,919
but what kind of file is that

201
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:29,680
it's a css file right it's not the

202
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,758
actual font

203
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,199
the css file does have you ever opened

204
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:34,720
it and looked at it it does all the font

205
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:37,280
face decorations

206
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,880
and then after that it calls out to

207
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:41,840
fetch the fonts

208
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:43,440
um so what do you think those last two

209
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:45,919
lines are

210
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:48,080
the fonts does this look efficient to

211
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,080
you

212
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:53,520
what's going on here why what does

213
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:57,520
anyone notice like a big glaring

214
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:59,840
issue of um what's going on here and

215
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:02,318
why i might have made this slower than

216
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:05,520
it needs to be

217
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:06,960
so we have remember index the css my

218
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,878
font css

219
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:13,840
and then the fonts that's the order so

220
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:13,840
what's going on there

221
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:23,199
yeah sorry sorry camera

222
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:27,840
what's why is this starting here after

223
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:27,840
the css

224
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:32,718
because i called it from my css have you

225
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,599
ever actually i'm going to break all

226
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:37,519
these rules

227
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:40,320
about the video sorry um

228
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:41,440
i am calling the font from your style

229
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,519
sheet because you know it gives you

230
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,839
those two options

231
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:47,360
um sometimes it's easier to do this like

232
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:49,120
maybe you're working with a framework or

233
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,399
a tool and it's easier to drop your font

234
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:53,519
call in your css

235
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:55,200
but you're paying a performance price

236
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:57,360
so what's one way we can fix that what's

237
00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:00,800
one way that we can

238
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,800
make it start loading right away

239
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,399
put it in the head of the html um

240
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,240
so when we put it in the head of the

241
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:10,000
html this is what happens so we've

242
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,399
we scooched it over some we don't have

243
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,839
to wait for the the css to be

244
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:19,440
downloaded and the csm css some created

245
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:22,399
and um then call our

246
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:24,160
finally our css for our fonts we can put

247
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:27,279
it in the head and it will start

248
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:28,719
downloading that font css style sheet

249
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:31,040
right away

250
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:33,600
but what but there's more things we can

251
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:35,760
do here to make this faster right

252
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,279
what do you notice about you can't read

253
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:41,040
this but

254
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:44,160
it says fonts.googleapis.com and then

255
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:46,079
the actual font lines say fonts.g

256
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,680
static you can't see the rest of this

257
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:50,800
but it's dot com and then there's a long

258
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:56,000
hash for the font

259
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:56,000
so what's happening here

260
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:04,160
yeah but didn't we just make a call to

261
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:06,000
to google they're on two different

262
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,839
domains

263
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,680
so the style sheet and the fonts are on

264
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:12,800
two different domains

265
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,800
so what do we have to do

266
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:16,079
yeah oh yeah we'll talk about the font

267
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:19,040
hints but um

268
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:20,719
so the browser has to start up a

269
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,160
connection to that separate domain but

270
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,959
it won't do that until it knows that it

271
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:28,640
has to reach out to that domain

272
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:30,079
um so we have this wasted time again

273
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,760
from doing this connection we know we're

274
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:32,000
going to do this connection but we don't

275
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:35,120
know

276
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,040
until after that style sheet is

277
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:39,120
downloaded and the css song is created

278
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:43,040
so that it knows

279
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:43,040
so resource hints are our friends um

280
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:48,319
we're going to focus on these middle

281
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:51,040
three um this is a nice little handy

282
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:52,800
thing i got from um one of addy awesome

283
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:55,120
andy's tweets he's a

284
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:56,719
he was a performance engineer at google

285
00:10:55,120 --> 00:11:00,399
i think he's on a different team now

286
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:02,240
but he has some great stuff um so

287
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:03,760
pre-connect preload and prefetch are

288
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,000
really fun um

289
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:07,839
resource hints uh we'll talk about dns

290
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,640
prefetch also but first we'll talk about

291
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:12,000
the others

292
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:14,800
so what pre-connect does is it can

293
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,920
warm up a connection for you it can do

294
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,880
all the steps of warming up that

295
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,719
connection for you

296
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:20,320
and just have it waiting for you in the

297
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,000
background but there's a time limit on

298
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,160
it

299
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,200
so if you don't think that you're going

300
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,360
to access

301
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:29,279
a domain until later what you can do is

302
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:31,360
instead do dns prefetch and it just does

303
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:32,160
a dns part so at least it negotiates

304
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,440
that time

305
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,600
but a pre-connect will do the rest of

306
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:38,720
the connection as well but it has

307
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:42,480
it's time sensitive um preload

308
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:45,920
what preload does is um

309
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:47,680
it tells the browser oh hey i know i'm

310
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:51,120
going to need this file

311
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:52,638
soon download it now so normally

312
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,079
browsers are smart they're not going to

313
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:56,000
download a file until they know it's

314
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:56,880
necessary when we're talking about fonts

315
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,800
and similar

316
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:00,079
so it's not going to pull it down until

317
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,880
it knows that you have the matching

318
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:02,638
characters

319
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,560
and that you're using the font on that

320
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:06,720
page based on the css

321
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:08,638
but preload says hey i'm going to just

322
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,600
go ahead and download it now

323
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:11,600
because i know i'm going to need it

324
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,880
later even though you don't know it yet

325
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,560
prefetch lets you uh

326
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,760
put things in your cache for future use

327
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,479
we're not going to talk about that in

328
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:19,040
here but just

329
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,040
so you know

330
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:23,440
so what can we do actually conveniently

331
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:25,680
on this slide

332
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,760
that code snippet is exactly what you

333
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:31,199
would use with google fonts

334
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:32,680
so what it says that is i want you to

335
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,839
warm up the connection to

336
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:36,560
fonts.gststatic.com

337
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:38,639
now and so if we just put that in on the

338
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,839
head of our html with our call to our

339
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:41,519
style sheet

340
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:43,920
then that connection will start to warm

341
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:45,360
up and you can see it down here

342
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,959
you know it's kind of just like on its

343
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:52,399
own hanging out here

344
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:54,000
before the actual fonts are downloaded

345
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:55,839
so you just copy that line directly in

346
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,360
there and that does a pre-connect

347
00:12:55,839 --> 00:13:00,720
and so now we've made our site faster

348
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:03,600
by just doing these little kind of

349
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:05,519
tricks like the code isn't significantly

350
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:08,480
different but you can actually

351
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:10,880
make a pretty good chunk of savings just

352
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,880
right there

353
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:15,920
let's talk about self-hosted fonts so

354
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:20,800
these are fonts that you host

355
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:22,399
you know on your domain

356
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:25,680
so you might call them in your head like

357
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:25,680
this um

358
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,319
preferably in your head because then you

359
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,720
know you don't have the same problem as

360
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:33,519
before when we call it from our css

361
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:35,680
so this is my waterfall what's on the

362
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:38,519
first line

363
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:40,239
the page itself right the second line is

364
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:41,839
mystal.css

365
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,680
that's also where i have my font face

366
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:45,360
declarations

367
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:50,000
and then what's going on with those last

368
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:52,000
two lines it's the fonts right

369
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,680
but like what was one of those hints do

370
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,959
you remember what i said earlier

371
00:13:53,680 --> 00:14:00,800
there's a hint that can say oh hey

372
00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:01,518
hey browser preconnect is for the

373
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,880
connection

374
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:05,040
we've already this is our domain so we

375
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:07,360
don't need to do any extra connections

376
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:09,519
preload so what we oh sorry forgot the

377
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:12,399
mic was there

378
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:13,519
so what we can do is we can say hey

379
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:16,160
browser

380
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:18,079
i'm definitely going to use this font i

381
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,920
want you to

382
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:22,239
download it earlier so i don't have this

383
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,680
longer time of waiting

384
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,519
um because you know what else is

385
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:27,359
happening what happens

386
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:28,720
while that font is downloading but it's

387
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,839
not yet loaded

388
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,839
what does the page look like

389
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,680
it depends on your font display settings

390
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:37,439
but it's either going to be

391
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:39,040
invisible or it's going to be a

392
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:43,279
different font

393
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:46,780
until that loads yeah

394
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:50,480
i call it food but other people say fout

395
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:52,959
[Laughter]

396
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,920
good thing we're not talking about uh

397
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:56,000
content

398
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:57,519
um so what we can do is we can preload

399
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,320
and the only thing i've added to these

400
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:01,920
lines here

401
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:03,680
is this rel equals preload

402
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,360
and then what can happen now on

403
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:08,800
supported browsers

404
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:09,440
is that those files will be downloaded

405
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,279
right away

406
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,800
any file i put link rail preload on

407
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:16,959
there so

408
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:16,959
with great power comes what

409
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:21,120
great responsibility if you watched any

410
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,839
superhero movie

411
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:25,440
um and so we don't want to abuse this

412
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:27,199
right

413
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,880
we only want to do this when we're

414
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:30,399
actually going to use they're definitely

415
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:32,399
going to use the file on that page

416
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:36,160
because we don't want to abuse

417
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:38,880
our users data plans and also i suspect

418
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:40,560
is it the next slide i suspect that's

419
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:42,720
why this has happened i don't know does

420
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:44,560
anyone know anyone on the firefox team

421
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:46,560
so on firefox preload used to be

422
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:49,839
supported and now it's not supported

423
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:50,319
it's like behind a flag so um i would

424
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:52,079
really

425
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,680
be curious if anyone on the firefox name

426
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:56,560
please uh oh my

427
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:57,599
twitter handle is the green greek um

428
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,839
please

429
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,959
let me know what happened there um my

430
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:02,720
guess is because

431
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:04,079
maybe they are concerned about the users

432
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,519
and kind of people abusing these

433
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:07,680
privileges

434
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:09,279
so um make sure that you don't abuse

435
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:12,479
this privilege but it will work in all

436
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:12,480
the other modern browsers

437
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:17,519
so um remember when i said when i said

438
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,360
uh

439
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:20,399
shared caching of popular fonts they

440
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,320
used to say like you know if you're

441
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:25,600
using open sans or roboto don't

442
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:27,440
uh just

443
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,519
do it directly from google fonts oh

444
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:32,480
don't ever try to just copy the hash

445
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:32,880
of the um of the font itself there's a

446
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,560
hash

447
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:36,000
so don't try to copy that whole url

448
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,920
because those are changed often and

449
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,079
they'll just disappear so you never want

450
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,639
to do that but shared cache is going

451
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:42,160
away

452
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:43,839
so now you can contemplate whether it

453
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,759
might be a good idea to download the

454
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:47,440
font and serve it locally even if it is

455
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:49,440
a google font you'll lose some of the

456
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:51,279
other benefits like the variants and

457
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:53,680
stuff like that

458
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:54,560
but um because of double key caching and

459
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,758
i don't know if anyone's going to talk

460
00:16:54,560 --> 00:17:00,319
about this later

461
00:16:55,759 --> 00:17:03,360
but shared cash is not really

462
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:05,839
a benefit anymore let's talk about font

463
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,839
rendering

464
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:14,000
so remember when i said white and fruit

465
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:15,199
or fout um floyd is on this page i know

466
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:19,119
it's a little hard to see

467
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:20,640
um this is i have a screenshot of

468
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:23,119
performance happening

469
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,160
that's what's over here on the right

470
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:25,678
hand side

471
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:27,199
and this is the page itself if you look

472
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:29,600
at the page itself you can see there are

473
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:32,880
actual words in my navbar

474
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:36,559
but if you could see this

475
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:39,919
screenshot better the

476
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:40,399
projector's a little bit dark there's no

477
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:43,840
words

478
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:45,520
in my nav bar there's no words in my

479
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:47,280
button

480
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:49,120
it's annoying right that's a flash of

481
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:50,559
invisible text does anyone know why

482
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:53,280
that's happening

483
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:54,160
this is this was using google fonts does

484
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:57,120
anyone know why

485
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,120
that was happening

486
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:03,440
yeah yeah so the default for

487
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:05,760
google fonts on their font display

488
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:07,919
property was display swap

489
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:09,679
so that means that it's going to show

490
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:11,440
the fallback font

491
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:13,280
for up to three seconds and then it

492
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:17,200
finally will switch to the web font

493
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:19,280
um so

494
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,480
it won't i'm sorry it will block it it

495
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:23,039
won't show anything at

496
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:24,480
all and um for three seconds and then it

497
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:26,160
will show the fallback and then it will

498
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:28,000
show the web font

499
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:29,600
and so this was annoying right like you

500
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,919
couldn't you had no control over this

501
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:35,360
before but now you have control

502
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:38,000
um with the google fonts api and now by

503
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,479
default it has this part of the url in

504
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,760
it

505
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:43,840
if you just add and display equal swap

506
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:45,760
you will get um display swap and what

507
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:48,799
display swap does is instead

508
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:50,320
of um making it invisible

509
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:52,559
it will show the fallback font until the

510
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:53,840
font web font is loaded

511
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:56,559
and we're going to kind of see a little

512
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:59,360
bit of this in action in a minute

513
00:18:56,559 --> 00:19:01,280
so that's really cool if you have legacy

514
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:03,199
apps that use google fonts

515
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:04,720
you can make you can make them use

516
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,640
display swap if you want all you have to

517
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:08,320
do is add that last part of the url

518
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:11,360
you don't have to like go in and like

519
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:15,360
re-copy your urls you just add the

520
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:15,360
um the query at the end

521
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:29,360
so that's not playing

522
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:31,919
so flash of unstyled text right

523
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:32,479
that's this change here that's annoying

524
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:34,559
right

525
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:38,240
um some i mean sometimes it's more

526
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:40,320
annoying than others

527
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:42,240
if we think about what's happening here

528
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:45,520
i mean this might vary by user

529
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:46,080
i feel like we used to match fonts based

530
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:49,520
more on

531
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:51,678
style but if i'm for example reading

532
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:53,360
a blog post or an article the thing

533
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:54,160
that's going to annoy me more is layout

534
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,000
shift

535
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:57,280
so once that font comes in if i'm on a

536
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,640
totally different paragraph when it

537
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:00,399
comes in

538
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,919
for me as a user that's going to annoy

539
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:05,440
me so for me

540
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:08,159
i reckon i um i guess

541
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:09,679
recognize the intent of this quote the

542
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:12,000
style doesn't matter so much

543
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:14,480
as it has to flow the same way and so

544
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:17,120
there's some great tools that we can use

545
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:18,840
like um font style matcher uh and i'm

546
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:21,600
gonna actually go to

547
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:23,600
this um and so what you can do

548
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:26,480
is you let me zoom in so you can see

549
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,480
this a little bit better

550
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:31,520
um you can put it automatically has

551
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:33,039
google fonts available here but you can

552
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:34,559
also upload your own font so i've

553
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:36,000
uploaded this font and i'm going to tell

554
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:38,158
you more about that font

555
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,360
and what my fallback font used to be was

556
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:42,080
ariel

557
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:43,199
so if i go down here you can see them

558
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,639
overlapped

559
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,559
we can use a different color for each

560
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:48,240
font so ariel's red now

561
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:49,760
and then you can see an action like the

562
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:53,360
shift that happens

563
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:54,720
um so i have this this is actually a

564
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,840
variable font i'm going to talk about

565
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,440
that in a minute

566
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:59,360
so we can see what happens and what we

567
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:02,000
can do is we can adjust properties

568
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:03,520
for example like font size arial if you

569
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,039
look here it just it's a little bit

570
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,559
smaller so i could like bump up the font

571
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:08,400
size and i could basically provide an

572
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:12,080
entire fallback font

573
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:12,880
and change things um change which one is

574
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,960
used based

575
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:16,559
use on javascript i prefer not to do

576
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:18,320
javascript so what i did is

577
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:21,520
i put in some other website fonts in

578
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:24,480
here and i found that

579
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:27,520
um verdana i actually don't know how to

580
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,520
pronounce that for donna

581
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:32,879
i put that one in and it matched a lot

582
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,200
faster

583
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,799
but you can actually get super close on

584
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,320
some fonts and then maybe you realize

585
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:41,840
you don't actually need

586
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:44,720
your web font but um but at least here

587
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:45,199
my um the size of the font the line

588
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,520
height

589
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:49,360
and the wet the letter spacing really

590
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:50,879
closely matches so it makes a really

591
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:52,399
great fallback font for me because i

592
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,080
don't want the extra javascript on the

593
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:58,320
page just to load a separate

594
00:21:54,080 --> 00:22:00,240
um font style as well

595
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:02,720
so that's a great tool to keep in your

596
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:07,200
back pocket for

597
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:08,799
having to deal with the swapping fonts

598
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:11,360
how many of you have used variable fonts

599
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:13,120
before i figured i would go into this a

600
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:15,120
little bit because they're fun and new

601
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,719
and so um and they also present some

602
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:18,479
challenges for performance

603
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:20,240
so we are going to we don't have slides

604
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:22,080
for this we're just going to do this

605
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:23,520
i started playing with this variable

606
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:25,439
font called recursive they have a really

607
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:28,559
cool website

608
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:30,320
um and it's a highly flexible new

609
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:32,559
variable font what i should do

610
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:35,840
is go to firefox when was the last time

611
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:35,840
you used firefox devtools

612
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:39,760
yesterday okay somebody actually hears

613
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:43,280
me so um

614
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:45,679
i do use okay that's fine

615
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,720
um i do use chrome mostly for

616
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:51,039
performance

617
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:51,039
but um firefox has

618
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:55,840
you know what helps what to do before

619
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,840
your talk

620
00:22:56,799 --> 00:23:02,400
get on the wi-fi

621
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,240
it helps actually i think it might be

622
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:08,000
hold on

623
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:11,120
yay all right um so if i go

624
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,720
into then

625
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:14,320
inspect my element actually did i

626
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:16,320
inspect that one

627
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:18,000
i was just doing it randomly let me

628
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:20,000
inspect

629
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,000
what's really cool about firefox

630
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:25,120
devtools is they have this whole

631
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:29,200
fonts panel over here i wonder if i can

632
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:30,559
zoom in that so if you look here

633
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,720
we're going to play this is so you can

634
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:34,480
see what this particular

635
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:36,720
variable font will do i mean you can

636
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:39,600
play with standard things like size

637
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:40,080
and uh line height which is kind of cool

638
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:44,000
and

639
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:46,799
letter spacing oh that's terrible

640
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,080
but it also has all these special things

641
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:48,799
that are just for this particular

642
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:51,120
variable font

643
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:51,840
so what does this variable font do right

644
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:55,520
now it's

645
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:58,080
on um not monospace but this font

646
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:59,440
actually can be mono space as well

647
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,799
so i like to use my blog as my

648
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:02,559
playground and so i'm using this

649
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:03,760
variable font so i can use oh this is my

650
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:06,320
coding font too

651
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,879
and then you know and my body text is

652
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:09,918
going to be

653
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:11,919
that and then um it's called casual but

654
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:13,360
i call it sassy versus not sassy

655
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:15,120
right now that i think that's sassy

656
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:18,240
here's not sassy

657
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:20,959
and then here's sassy aka casual

658
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:22,159
um weight so look at that it's like a

659
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,559
smooth transition

660
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:26,000
i can like choose any weight in there

661
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:27,120
that's pretty cool so instead of like

662
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,120
downloading you know you have to

663
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:30,399
download your 700 weight your 800 weight

664
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:33,199
like if you want heavy bold

665
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:34,960
or you're lightweight um you could

666
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,559
theoretically just have all your weights

667
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:38,559
in one variable font

668
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:40,000
and then slant like italics there's

669
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:40,799
actually slant and italic are two

670
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,000
different things

671
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:47,200
um italic actually changes um

672
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,000
slant features as well so firefox that's

673
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:51,279
one lesson from

674
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,640
this firefox infecting inspecting fonts

675
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:55,200
are really great actually

676
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:56,960
css grid and other inspect element

677
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:59,679
things are really cool there

678
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:01,919
um so that's a variable font an intro to

679
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:04,480
a variable font um

680
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:04,480
but um

681
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:09,120
how how many how many kilobytes do you

682
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:10,720
think are loaded when you do like a

683
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:12,000
regular font

684
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:15,120
has anyone like looked at that how many

685
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:18,640
kilobytes you use

686
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:20,879
yeah so i feel like um you know like per

687
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:22,640
per style that you use because it might

688
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,880
be like it's like 400 weight

689
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,919
regular would be maybe 15 to 20

690
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,679
kilobytes or

691
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:29,840
up to 30 it depends on really the font

692
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:30,559
or in uh what subsets you're using like

693
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:33,918
is this just

694
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:38,000
you know latin text or is it others um

695
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:39,600
and so so maybe you have like

696
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,880
maybe let's say you have four of those

697
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,000
because you're doing maybe you have two

698
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,720
different fonts and you have two

699
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,080
different ways

700
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:47,039
that's conservative that's like 80

701
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:50,720
kilobytes maybe so

702
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:51,679
my basic english subset was 130

703
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:53,360
kilobytes

704
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:54,720
because it's a variable font like i said

705
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:56,158
this is my blog so i get to play with

706
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,200
things it's okay if they're a little bit

707
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:59,279
bigger

708
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,880
so what happened was the designer came

709
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:02,159
out with a new version the font designer

710
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:04,159
came out with a new version and he

711
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:06,159
wanted me to deploy it but it was like

712
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:08,320
400 kilobytes and i was like

713
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:10,080
are you a performance engineer i don't

714
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:11,678
think i should do that

715
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:13,600
so we started playing with performance

716
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:14,960
more so if we have things like variable

717
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,520
fonts what are some other things we

718
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:18,400
could do

719
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:19,600
perhaps do you have any ideas i mean i

720
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,400
don't know if we have this all correct

721
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,520
but

722
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,960
what do you think we can do there's

723
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,520
another thing i haven't spoken about

724
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:28,640
here

725
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:28,639
with fonts that you can do yeah

726
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:35,039
yeah so subsetting well we can subset

727
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,760
based on character codes um do you know

728
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:37,360
about this

729
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:39,279
inside your font i don't know if you've

730
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:41,199
played in font display properties

731
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:43,360
we're all developers most of us are

732
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:45,840
developers in here right so it's like

733
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:48,479
we don't often play or learn all the css

734
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:51,199
things that maybe we should

735
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:53,279
um but uh let me zoom in a little i was

736
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:55,039
going to show you the difference with um

737
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:57,360
for donna but it's fine so what we did

738
00:26:55,039 --> 00:27:00,000
is we made more subsets

739
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:01,520
and so most of my website is in basic

740
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:05,919
english characters

741
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:06,400
and so um you can put a unicode range in

742
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:09,760
your

743
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:11,840
um font face declarations and it knows

744
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:13,520
to use this font for this unicode range

745
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,399
and this is the only one that i preload

746
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:16,158
now

747
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,840
i don't preload the rest and then the

748
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:19,279
others will only ever load if they're

749
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:23,120
used on a page

750
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:25,200
so um like i have um

751
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:26,799
yeah so like some diacritics and some

752
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:30,159
other things some symbols

753
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:31,520
and extended fonts and then a special

754
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:34,399
font just for my first name because i

755
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:37,120
made it the super heavyweight

756
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:37,840
so um that's that's the path we chose

757
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,520
there's also

758
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:42,000
tools you can do to subset your fonts if

759
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:44,480
you want really aggressive subsetting um

760
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,000
it's actually called sub font i think i

761
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:47,679
have a link to it in the back of this

762
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,039
but if you want to look at sub fonting

763
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:50,399
not just for variable fonts for any

764
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:51,840
fonts you can look at this tool called

765
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:53,760
cell font

766
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:55,600
i forgot the developer who wrote it but

767
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:59,200
it kind of gives you a whole

768
00:27:55,600 --> 00:28:01,760
set of tools for setting up your fonts

769
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:04,080
in a more performant way

770
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:05,279
so yeah what's really cool about preload

771
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:08,240
which i forgot to mention because i

772
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:11,440
wanted to show it to you live

773
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:14,080
is that often what

774
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:16,480
happens is we can beat the rendering

775
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:18,960
path remember what preload does

776
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:19,919
it auto it automatically we put in our

777
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,200
head that we're going to

778
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:22,960
use this font and i want you to pre-load

779
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,840
it i want you to load it now so what we

780
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:27,360
can often do

781
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:30,559
is the only what happened there when i

782
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:33,760
reload it did you see that

783
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:34,960
i should slow it down there's only

784
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:44,320
one thing that happened there that you

785
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:47,440
could visually see right oh

786
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:49,918
not slow orbic so it did that but on a

787
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:52,000
faster connection

788
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:55,360
what can often happen is we actually

789
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,360
skip that fallback time

790
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,719
i do have a display swap on my name

791
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:02,158
because it's

792
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:03,440
brand it's branded so like branded

793
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:04,799
things you might want to keep swap

794
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:09,600
because you don't want to see the

795
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:12,399
ugly font on your brand um but yeah

796
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:14,959
so if i go to firefox right which

797
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:14,959
doesn't do

798
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,600
preload

799
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:27,840
i need to disable the cache

800
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:41,840
this one has a much bigger layout shift

801
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,840
all right

802
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:55,918
so more more resources mentioned i do

803
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:57,760
have a short article it's a little bit

804
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:59,360
data now but it still works if you want

805
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:01,279
to learn how to

806
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:02,959
self-host your google fonts there's a

807
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:04,159
little tool you can use in there and the

808
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:07,279
steps involved

809
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:08,799
um also when you're looking at things

810
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:10,159
like um

811
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:12,158
i didn't mention this in this talk

812
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:14,080
specifically but you can

813
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:15,600
pull your data into can i use like if

814
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,320
you use google analytics you can pull in

815
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:18,559
that data

816
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:20,320
and you can see like you know for my

817
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:21,120
particular users is this feature going

818
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:24,158
to be supported

819
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:27,279
like for example preload um

820
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:30,960
most of my users for one um client

821
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:33,600
are on um safari so it's supported

822
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:34,720
thank goodness um and then subfont that

823
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:37,678
tool i mentioned

824
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:38,480
which you can use for any type of font

825
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:40,640
so thanks

826
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:42,640
thanks for coming to my talk again the

827
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:46,159
slides are at bitly font perf

828
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:48,320
and um writing resources more

829
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:49,440
co.codes you can get find me at the

830
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:52,320
green greek

831
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:52,320
we will um

832
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:56,080
i guess we'll take a few questions i

833
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:57,918
prefer offline questions though

834
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:59,678
so feel free to come up to me later i'll

835
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:01,760
be in this room for the rest of the

836
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:03,519
web thing so in the breaks and then also

837
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:04,879
afterwards if you want to you know reach

838
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:06,320
