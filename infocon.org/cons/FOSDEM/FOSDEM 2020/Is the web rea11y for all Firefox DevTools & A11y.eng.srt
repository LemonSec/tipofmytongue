1
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:09,760
so we're gonna

2
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:13,040
continue exploring um

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:14,080
a11i with joanna who's gonna talk about

4
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:18,000
us

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:22,000
about being ready for it or not so

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,320
uh welcome joanna thanks so much

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,320
um

8
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,599
do you hear me well with this all good

9
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,719
good

10
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:34,880
um i really want to start with the

11
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:36,000
basic question if there are people in

12
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,840
the room that don't know

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,440
well let's go the other way who in the

14
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:42,840
room knows about what

15
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:46,160
a 11i means

16
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,440
okay i'm glad i chose this not to put on

17
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:50,078
the spot the ones that don't

18
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:52,320
uh it's really not a problem literally

19
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:54,480
yesterday one of my colleagues

20
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,399
working in tech asked me what's that

21
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,000
test about and i was like did you even

22
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:01,600
like try to google it first

23
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,879
before asking paid job i mean um

24
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:06,720
i like this um whoa this is fast i like

25
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,240
this title is not a bug definitely a

26
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,520
feature because probably you know the

27
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,679
developers

28
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:13,200
tend to have this reply when the qa says

29
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,799
oh i found a bug

30
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,479
and they are just nice enough to like

31
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:18,320
it's not a bug it's just a feature

32
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:19,840
and i really want uh for you all to

33
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:23,520
treat accessibility which

34
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:24,960
that stands for a11i accessibility

35
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,798
treat accessibility like something that

36
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,720
has to come

37
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:30,799
like a feature implemented by the

38
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:32,400
default and it's not a bug

39
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:34,400
definitely not an enhancement i'll

40
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,200
mention that about more

41
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,079
in the talk who anna who am i and why

42
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,720
i'm here

43
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:42,240
um my name is jana kiran i tend to reply

44
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:45,200
also to luana iona

45
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:47,199
any other kind of version of my name um

46
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,799
slightly i embrace more lana because it

47
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,799
has an hawaiian tent

48
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,880
of feeling and who doesn't like hawaii

49
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:55,520
such tropical not raining like this

50
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,320
where more more i'm a project management

51
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:59,280
at this point

52
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:00,719
a former qa team lead quality assurance

53
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,439
and i lead four projects

54
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:04,559
as a contractor for mozilla in cluj

55
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:06,719
romania

56
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,080
yes that's the heart of transylvania i

57
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:09,119
took my blood in the morning i'm not

58
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,039
gonna buy it

59
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:12,640
i have literally i have to change the

60
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:14,720
slide i have uh

61
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,640
almost 10 years next month i'll make 10

62
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,080
years since when i started volunteering

63
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,480
with mozilla

64
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,599
and i do other volunteer with european

65
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,359
commission especially you want to

66
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:25,040
mention because we are in brussels

67
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,120
code week it's an initiative to teach

68
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,239
more people to be literate in digital

69
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,319
skills

70
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:31,920
not everyone has to learn how to code

71
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:33,200
but everyone has to understand how the

72
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,720
computers work because

73
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,640
wanted or not we are going to have more

74
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,480
of those coming in the future

75
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,879
and i work for devices with more than 10

76
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:44,959
years not happy about that but

77
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:47,359
we'll see um sarah hendren had a

78
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:48,000
really nice quote that i posted right

79
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,760
there

80
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,840
at the course of our lives we traffic

81
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:53,518
between relative independence and

82
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,879
defendants

83
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:56,560
and i really agree with this because

84
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:57,840
even if we are considered lucky and we

85
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,480
have pretty much everything we need

86
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,040
daily

87
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,679
we do face situations in which all our

88
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,799
um

89
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:07,280
all of our good size or everything that

90
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:09,680
are considered perks of living in a nice

91
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,400
european city maybe will definitely go

92
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,560
under

93
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,000
uh even when you go on with a metro or

94
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,519
you travel for something else or you

95
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,800
have colleagues that you work for from

96
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:19,120
different countries

97
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,840
and it doesn't matter if at a certain

98
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,519
point

99
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,440
we are used to everything good we have

100
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:25,519
to also be prepared for something

101
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,720
changing in this world there are one

102
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:30,400
billion people

103
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:33,440
having a certain disability a means

104
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,560
means 50 of the entire world and it's

105
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,480
not a joke

106
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,799
and more than 2 million people have a

107
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:41,200
very significant disability

108
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:42,400
what i mean here is that i will be the

109
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,798
first to accept

110
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,080
i have no disability visible i have no

111
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:47,920
disability on paper

112
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,120
but i do have issues when i tend to

113
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,599
write and i

114
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,560
read and i'll show an example even if

115
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:54,640
i'm tested

116
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,319
my name is the blind one translated but

117
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:58,399
i see well officially

118
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:00,238
but some people tend to miss the part

119
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,599
that's slightly on the screen we display

120
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:05,200
things differently

121
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:09,518
and they do not test it for our

122
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:09,518
accessibility issues welcome

123
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:15,679
i wanna ask you if any of you sees the

124
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,239
error

125
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,959
on this screen for the from the start

126
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:22,000
good

127
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,000
can you tell me what it is

128
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,080
yeah so around here i had this talk

129
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,759
before and somebody told me

130
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,639
that literally they didn't see it even

131
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:35,199
when i showed it so this is a column

132
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,000
it's a line where the columns have

133
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,400
titles

134
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,840
but you can barely see it this was from

135
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:43,039
a page of conference

136
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:45,359
that has tickets more than one point k

137
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:47,680
euros for the conference and they expect

138
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,759
people to go and buy it right

139
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,720
i wasn't able to see what i'm buying for

140
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:52,479
and again it was a

141
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,240
well-paid conference was nothing made by

142
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:57,039
a i don't know developer

143
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,160
trying to do a project from himself you

144
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,400
expect like

145
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,360
to see and i'm not gonna even mention

146
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,960
the reply was

147
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,560
um can you tell us more we don't

148
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,198
understand what you mean and i literally

149
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,720
wrote the guy

150
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:08,240
ronan i don't understand what the

151
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,160
columns are i need to change

152
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,759
to use inspect and change the behind

153
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,120
color to understand what you're selling

154
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,560
to me and it's about money

155
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,639
and you won't attend this to your

156
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:19,360
conference right and

157
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:20,400
again officially i have no disability no

158
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,880
visual impairs

159
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:25,280
no problem with my eyes well we never

160
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:27,840
know these ones right

161
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:29,520
um so yeah we kind of realized that some

162
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,799
issues are around there but how could we

163
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:34,560
fix it

164
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:36,639
a nice um quote from wright says that we

165
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,160
can fly with our motors but not without

166
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,360
knowledge and skills

167
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,520
if you don't know how to control the

168
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:44,720
motors we probably end up

169
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,719
in a not a good position

170
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:49,039
so let's talk about what does it mean

171
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:52,560
accessibility in form of

172
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:54,400
disabilities welcome the visual one that

173
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,880
i mentioned to you now it's

174
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,159
can be from complete blindness or color

175
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:01,600
brandon's for

176
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:04,479
poor vision in our case was just a

177
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:06,000
not nice color choosing and probably was

178
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:08,560
compared with a provision from my

179
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,360
side on the screen that i chose to have

180
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,039
and

181
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,880
also flashing elements will definitely

182
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:13,680
cause stroke to some people you probably

183
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,840
know

184
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,160
there are many mentioned till now and

185
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:20,479
try to avoid them as possible

186
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,280
physical disabilities people that cannot

187
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:24,800
use the mouse

188
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:25,359
or cannot um use the hand so they either

189
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,400
have to use

190
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:31,440
voice or um tabs to

191
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:34,719
go forward to a page

192
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:36,479
cognitive disabilities this uh

193
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,479
are like learning difficulties or poor

194
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,960
memory you're not able to understand the

195
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:40,400
font

196
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,318
was written on a page or you have

197
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,120
dyslexia and it's very hard for you to

198
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:46,080
understand

199
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:47,199
uh if the text is very narrowed or mixed

200
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:50,560
and

201
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:51,360
is not addressing your condition and we

202
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,599
go back to

203
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,120
literacy disability i mentioned this

204
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:56,639
before i really think it's important for

205
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,479
people to learn how to navigate the

206
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:59,280
internet how to navigate a page in the

207
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:01,280
browser

208
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,280
you have issues when you don't

209
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:05,679
understand what the box is

210
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,638
what's a button doing it's a problem

211
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:10,000
like this

212
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:13,199
that's more addressing web literacy

213
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
and hearing here of course you hear very

214
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:17,360
well if

215
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:20,639
you hear what you very low and

216
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:22,240
if you have a song or your web is trying

217
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,160
to communicate something most of the

218
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,639
people will not be able to

219
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,639
hear it

220
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:30,880
but you are here because we really

221
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:32,960
believe that the web at least mozilla

222
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:34,960
stands for this the web is for everyone

223
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:37,198
and it's our job to make it available

224
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:39,680
for them

225
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:41,039
and more and more we tend to use

226
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,199
automatic things we

227
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:44,878
tend to use devices and even if you're

228
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:46,720
not talking about smartphone you want to

229
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:48,800
go to pay maybe at the

230
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,400
marketplace you can go now and choose to

231
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,360
pay by yourself without any interaction

232
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,878
with a human

233
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,039
or if you want to go and buy a ticket

234
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:56,560
for the bus not very

235
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:58,318
friendly here in brussels just saying i

236
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,919
was not able um

237
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,440
you definitely need to have some skills

238
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:02,318
in reading those things and need to

239
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:05,680
access

240
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:06,960
to approach more accessibility how many

241
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,960
of you try to

242
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,000
buy something online and the button is

243
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:13,280
too small for your

244
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,440
cute little fingers yes

245
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:17,198
how many of us zooms like this to see

246
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:19,520
something there because they are not

247
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:20,800
yes again i'm called the blind one so i

248
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,878
take all this on me

249
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,000
everyone else is perfect in the room i'm

250
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:26,080
not

251
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
i was mentioning that we need to do this

252
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,039
and we're asking okay joanna it's nice

253
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,319
but why

254
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:31,840
literally the first thing that i wanted

255
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:32,800
to put on the page is because of the

256
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:36,319
people

257
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:39,838
again like um i mentioned before the

258
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:42,240
audible part it's really if someone is

259
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:45,519
whispering to you and don't understand

260
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,720
you cannot do do anything else also like

261
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:48,480
um

262
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,720
you want to try more things you're going

263
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:53,839
on the countries you're really limited

264
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:55,279
um it was literally an example here this

265
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:57,440
is not my laptop

266
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:58,959
unfortunately this is it and i wanted to

267
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,720
borrow one of my colleagues was all in

268
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:02,640
german i knew everything in the browser

269
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,320
even in german because i'm used to it

270
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:06,240
but if somebody else will try to use it

271
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,920
not having a knowledge of

272
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,800
the browser nor the language was not

273
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,800
that easy for them

274
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,560
and i also wanted to show you some

275
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:16,640
examples because

276
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,839
you probably see like oh if i don't have

277
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:21,360
any disability

278
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:23,040
i'm 100 safe on the on this side

279
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,640
a real life example would be the

280
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:27,519
wheelchair ramps you know

281
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:28,080
any um institutions from the state or

282
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:30,000
government

283
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,200
should have the ramps for disabilities

284
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,040
or the sidewalk

285
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,240
when you go down from a sidewalk across

286
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,880
a street and go up

287
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:40,480
they should have those little ramps how

288
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:40,480
many of you use those with bikes

289
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,640
don't be ashamed like we all do if you

290
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,800
don't have bike lanes

291
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:48,880
how many of you saw moms with babies in

292
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:50,640
strollers using them

293
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,080
do they have disabilities do you think a

294
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,680
cute mom with a little baby has a

295
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:56,880
disability

296
00:09:53,680 --> 00:10:00,079
it's not i'm seeing you

297
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:01,839
it is not so things like this really

298
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,320
even i when i run i don't want to go

299
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:04,399
from

300
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,720
like this to this and have an impact i

301
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:08,399
tend to use the ramps more and more

302
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,160
so again situation where you don't

303
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:11,519
consider the disabled but you use

304
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,279
things that are addressed to disabled

305
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:15,839
people

306
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:17,439
regulation everyone here is like they

307
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:18,000
don't even ask for that johanna what are

308
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:21,120
you talking

309
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,920
about nobody cares well unfortunately

310
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,000
i'm sad to say

311
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:26,479
that these are the country that adopted

312
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:30,320
the vg

313
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:32,800
vcag the green ones

314
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:34,079
you see it here are still at version one

315
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:37,359
but they have it

316
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:40,399
the in pink they are recommended and the

317
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:43,040
red ones which is pretty intense um

318
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:44,959
have adopted the 2.0 my colleague had a

319
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,240
talk really before this and he mentioned

320
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:48,479
more about what this

321
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,920
regulation implies and how you should

322
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,760
implement it as a

323
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:53,839
developer so if you're saying your

324
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:55,519
country is not

325
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:57,120
maybe you're from africa which is not a

326
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:58,880
bad thing and i'm glad but

327
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,720
definitely you're gonna step in and join

328
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,320
us in this or russia but

329
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,000
i don't know i'm not going to talk to

330
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:07,200
russia i'm neighbors with them

331
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,360
almost so i'm i'm friends

332
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,200
um or greenland if you want to go there

333
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,480
join me i want to go to let's see maybe

334
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,160
we can implement the terms

335
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:16,480
so pretty much all the countries adopted

336
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:19,680
in a way these kind of regulations so

337
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:22,800
um there is no excuse

338
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:25,199
users i literally

339
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:26,240
had a talk yesterday or somebody earlier

340
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:29,040
at the talk mentioned

341
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:31,200
how can i see if someone is using the

342
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:33,120
voice over on my page

343
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,279
how could i know how many users are

344
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:37,519
disabled okay i think there are many

345
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:39,360
tricks on telemetry that you can

346
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:40,959
implement and they might tell you if

347
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,120
something is click or not

348
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:44,160
but it doesn't even matter at this point

349
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,480
because

350
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,600
one of the oldest example in the world

351
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,639
with data sets

352
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:53,360
comes from the world war ii when the

353
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:54,880
industry industry was so blooming and

354
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,480
they wanted to build everything the next

355
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,959
day and beat our

356
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,480
competitors you know and they decided to

357
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:02,638
look at the place

358
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,240
to put more metal or like make them

359
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:06,959
harder to

360
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,760
get a bullet on the sides that are more

361
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:09,839
affected

362
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:11,680
so what did they do they looked at each

363
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:14,880
plane that came back from the world

364
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:15,839
and saw where had bullets in and they

365
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:18,320
realized that oh

366
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:19,120
in the wings we can fix that here we can

367
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,760
fix that

368
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,480
oh the tail we can even take it off i'm

369
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,399
kidding

370
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,760
but they didn't see the big problems

371
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:28,000
these were the plays that

372
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,880
returned to the base those who got the

373
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,760
most affected

374
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:32,959
did not ever return so those were the

375
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,439
problematic ones

376
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:36,399
this one with issues here can be fixed

377
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,880
they are coming back

378
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:39,760
those with issues not mentioned or

379
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,839
harder than this

380
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:44,800
never came back unfortunately so when

381
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:46,160
you're looking at the database of users

382
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:49,279
be careful what you're testing you might

383
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:52,480
be on the wrong side

384
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:53,200
and i heard that no honeymoon no money

385
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,760
honey

386
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:57,519
no return of investment come on people

387
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:59,760
you can enhance your brand

388
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:01,279
do more for the world and definitely

389
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:03,600
having a good page will

390
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:05,439
bring you only good size and money comes

391
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:09,040
after if you see how many

392
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:11,200
um shoppings are done with pages that

393
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:13,360
have accessibility embedded or

394
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,800
people that address new people new user

395
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,120
new markets i mean

396
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:19,680
the amount of money that they do i think

397
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:22,079
it's considerable

398
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,719
one thing that i think um it's very

399
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:24,959
important

400
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,639
and i mentioned from beginning is not

401
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:28,638
doing favors to anyone

402
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:30,160
it's literally doing your job because

403
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:31,760
accessibility is not

404
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:33,519
enhancements to it it's not something

405
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:36,720
that is nice to have

406
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:37,440
or maybe a bug certain tester put it and

407
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,040
bother you

408
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:41,040
is something that you should be having

409
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,399
by default you should drive innovation

410
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,639
at anything on the web

411
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:47,839
and you put the best practices this was

412
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:49,839
part of the show to wake up

413
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:51,519
what i mean by improving practice is if

414
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:53,519
we would have stayed at the

415
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:55,360
wheel made of wood i don't think we

416
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:56,399
would have had these nice cars that you

417
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,639
see around here

418
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:00,000
with the air wheels and everything so

419
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:01,360
even if it's a good practice at the

420
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,639
moment we should always strive to

421
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:06,639
improve it and make

422
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:09,760
more more accessible to all

423
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:12,079
so the second part what i mentioned that

424
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:14,000
is nice to know but you have to learn

425
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:16,800
and

426
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,399
nobody has time i know but i'm here to

427
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:21,920
show you a trick that the browser can do

428
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:25,279
and those are the accessibility audits

429
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:27,360
um i mentioned in the early talk

430
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:29,199
i replied to a question i really

431
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,600
recommend the fans talk

432
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:33,040
stefans yeah he's here we'll see you

433
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,720
later

434
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,719
work on accessibility he's part of the

435
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:39,040
accessibility club in berlin

436
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:41,040
and he did mention to this to this to me

437
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:43,920
in a session when i asked him

438
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:44,719
stefan let's talk about money how much

439
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:47,199
time

440
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,959
slash money you are wasting by

441
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:50,800
implementing the accessibility issue

442
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:52,560
he was like what are you talking about

443
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:54,079
it's like anything else i learned like a

444
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,719
new class like a new framework that i

445
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:56,800
adopt

446
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,800
i have to study it once which i did it

447
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:01,040
for in his case a long time ago

448
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:02,880
and now i just take it with myself in

449
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:05,120
all other projects and i realize that

450
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,639
exactly that is because come on everyone

451
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,279
each of you from here who develops a

452
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:09,040
page

453
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:10,880
tries new stuff and then adopts them

454
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:13,279
without thinking like oh

455
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,639
this takes me five minutes and it's like

456
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:18,320
50 cents

457
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:20,959
maybe much so i think it's just a

458
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:23,680
case of positioning ourselves and that's

459
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:25,839
my case today to you

460
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:28,000
how can you do this easier dev tools

461
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:31,040
audits i'm going to mention some of them

462
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,680
uh in the talk color contrast it

463
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:34,000
showcased

464
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:35,359
also pattern and colors be careful there

465
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:39,040
people might tend to

466
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:42,079
not see different uh patterns in your

467
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:44,000
in your page or typography

468
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:45,519
what strikes me here is that indeed some

469
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,240
people cannot understand the scripts or

470
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:48,720
like very

471
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,279
calligraphic fonts is very hard for them

472
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:52,560
and

473
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:54,079
unfortunately for well unfortunately

474
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:56,160
that correctly is

475
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:57,599
fortunately and unfortunately comic sans

476
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:00,240
which all of us hate

477
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:02,639
or at least is a meme to hate comic sans

478
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,639
is the best one to address dyslexia

479
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:07,279
this was study and most people really

480
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:09,360
had the improved

481
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:11,759
experience on the web while using comic

482
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:14,399
sense if there is any designer in the

483
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:15,920
room i'm apologizing for mentioning this

484
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:18,320
um animations

485
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:19,759
they are super cool right but not

486
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,920
everyone can handle them

487
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:23,199
uh they provoke strokes or also for

488
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,880
normal people i mean sometimes they're

489
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:25,519
like what even i'm looking i don't

490
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,600
understand

491
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:28,959
so try not to put so many on your page

492
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,959
most of the people

493
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:32,399
will not understand all of them

494
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:35,518
cementing here

495
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:37,680
um i'll show you an example later and

496
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:38,639
please add alt input for all of the

497
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,239
things you have

498
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:42,720
if people want to parse your page they

499
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,000
should know where they are

500
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,920
should be able to hear what they are

501
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,959
parsing while they are opening different

502
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:51,680
tabs or buttons on your page

503
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:52,560
okay depth to audits this is the cutest

504
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:55,680
part because we

505
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:58,719
go back to my favorite browser which is

506
00:16:55,680 --> 00:17:01,359
be careful firefox or knight for firefox

507
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,920
and um another question earlier in the

508
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,600
talk and i

509
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,199
literally addressed it now was asking

510
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,640
which framework is the best it really

511
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:07,919
doesn't even matter which format you

512
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:09,839
choose at the end of the day

513
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:11,199
it's everything about in the browser and

514
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:13,678
you can use it

515
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:15,360
i have to admit unfortunately that also

516
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:17,679
other browser have some things

517
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:19,039
not only firefox but i recommend firefox

518
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:21,600
oh it's easier

519
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:22,319
and we are going to open the aria 3

520
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:26,000
inspector

521
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:28,480
in a second and that was made with

522
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,600
mozilla accessibility team which

523
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,960
literally includes people with

524
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:34,799
disability

525
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:36,720
visual or hearing ones and physical ones

526
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:38,240
and being there in the dev tools we can

527
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,559
run the simulation let's see if that

528
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,559
works

529
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:46,879
this is the talk i already opened the

530
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:48,480
the f12

531
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:50,559
the accessibility panel i'm going to

532
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:54,720
just turn on the features

533
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:56,720
and move one of the pages we

534
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,080
use for and i have to open it again of

535
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:01,840
course

536
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:01,840
for the examples here

537
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:06,320
and as i mentioned it's just simple

538
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,039
simulation it's already embedded in the

539
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,639
browser

540
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:10,720
and you can choose to check for all

541
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:12,559
these three of course all of them

542
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,840
but i'm gonna take them one by one so

543
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:16,240
you see the difference b

544
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:17,840
so here if we parse from the first thing

545
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:20,559
it will tell us that

546
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:22,799
we don't have a good color contrast the

547
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:25,039
standard goes to

548
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:27,280
triple a and here we are definitely not

549
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:31,360
on the good side

550
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:31,360
if we are going to go in the inspector

551
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,840
wait for me it's live coding so never

552
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:40,960
works from the beginning

553
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:43,600
we can either change the background here

554
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:47,520
with something more darker

555
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:47,520
or it's not there right

556
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:57,840
and voila let's run again

557
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:10,000
yes that's one contrast

558
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:11,918
i should load okay so we fixed that one

559
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,919
very simple i know you'll say like black

560
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:14,559
on white is not this is the minimal like

561
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:17,440
i do like

562
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:18,720
instantly of course your designers or

563
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,679
five more minutes from your side will

564
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,200
choose a better

565
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:22,880
there is a tool online which will give

566
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:25,039
you pairings of colors

567
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,559
all mentioned in links in the in the

568
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:29,520
talk

569
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:30,399
or if you want you can change the the

570
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:34,000
color of the

571
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:36,240
text here the second one is you see

572
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,559
um you will see that keyboard like

573
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:40,720
parsing with a keyboard on your on your

574
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:42,480
page will not bring any value back

575
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:44,400
because you're not defined that

576
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,919
and you'll see like oh how she knows

577
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,320
that i don't

578
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:49,120
but there is a link to learn more so

579
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:52,240
after you get

580
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:53,520
all this audit you can go and learn more

581
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,679
about it and see if it

582
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:57,600
literally makes an impact or not if you

583
00:19:55,679 --> 00:20:00,160
can do it from the beginning or

584
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,639
you just have this this is the best part

585
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,000
and it's

586
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,840
pretty much implemented in the second

587
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,880
part of last year

588
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:07,360
um there is was a tool web hints that i

589
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,440
o

590
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:11,039
probably saw it i think it was at fosman

591
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:12,159
last year too with cue stickers of a

592
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:14,080
whale

593
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:16,480
um it literally gives you at any point

594
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:19,120
in your page hints about how can you can

595
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:20,880
how can you improve it better and make

596
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:23,120
it more accessible again

597
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,159
i know it's 2020 nobody has time to

598
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:26,000
learn everything but

599
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:28,480
these little tricks online help us do a

600
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,480
better job

601
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:36,158
something that it's literally fresh and

602
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:37,760
hot in-depth tool is also this simulator

603
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:40,159
which again will find the same issues

604
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:42,640
even if the color contracts is okay

605
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:45,200
which i would have to say think it's not

606
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:48,240
the best

607
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:49,760
let's see um

608
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,360
it's the same issue with the keyboard

609
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:54,720
behind it

610
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:58,000
i'm sorry i was looking now and let's

611
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,000
run the simulation now

612
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:07,280
um all issues this time yeah it's fine

613
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:09,600
but if we look at only contrast

614
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,600
um

615
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:14,080
oh it doesn't say i'll show you on the

616
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,080
slides i will say that it's

617
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:19,360
minimal but not triple eight which is

618
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:22,799
the regulation recommended

619
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:24,639
um i have this tab option ops tab open

620
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:25,840
in case of the internet not working

621
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,480
because you have to prepare for

622
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:30,158
everything

623
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:33,600
so let's um

624
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:36,480
definitely okay again i

625
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:37,760
what i showed you is just simple on um

626
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:40,240
f12

627
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:41,760
opening the accessibility panel and you

628
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:44,159
can do their uh

629
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:46,400
that the simulation mentioned this is

630
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:48,480
what i did before again in case of

631
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:50,080
no internet and you can see even in the

632
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:53,280
element of field input

633
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:54,720
we had the focus issue and also not a

634
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,399
label for it again when

635
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:58,159
they will parse the website and they

636
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,520
will get to the taxi food where

637
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:01,280
you definitely want them to enter

638
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,240
something they could not read what's

639
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:05,678
behind the level

640
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:07,840
uh behind it and you can see here again

641
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:09,840
learn more for each one and all of the

642
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:12,399
issues they found on the page

643
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:15,439
are mentioning the type of the error and

644
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:17,600
also a link to learn more for them

645
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:19,200
but i changed the the background and

646
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:22,158
after that i changed the

647
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:24,240
color of it to have a showcase and again

648
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:28,480
just a simple

649
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:31,679
change of color in the file inspect

650
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:34,240
okay here um this was what i mentioned

651
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:35,280
with more and if you see here they will

652
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:38,559
show that it's a

653
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:38,960
double a which is okay but you can learn

654
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:41,840
more

655
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:43,440
again about the the standard that i

656
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:45,918
mentioned with the links there

657
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:47,120
other tools that help you learn this one

658
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:49,600
um

659
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:52,239
the first one and i guess you all know

660
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:53,600
about this term manual testing

661
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,760
there is no such thing like manual

662
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:57,760
testing everything you do it's a testing

663
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:59,200
uh but i would recommend you to just try

664
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:01,200
to keep your clothes

665
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:03,679
eyes closed and try to navigate your

666
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:06,799
page first

667
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:07,919
yeah it was a hard one for me um and

668
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:09,039
after that of course there are tools

669
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:11,919
online like jaws

670
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:12,879
for microsoft or orca voice over for um

671
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:16,159
mac os

672
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:18,320
to help you use the page in in

673
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:21,440
blind more of easy reduced visibility

674
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:24,480
mode lighthouse is a tool from

675
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:27,360
google not happy but

676
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:28,640
but it's a good one uh you can do the

677
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:30,639
whole simulation of your

678
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,919
page in lighthouse and one of their

679
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:33,919
features is to give you more

680
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:35,039
details about the accessibility status

681
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:37,520
of your

682
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:38,559
project wave is also doing a screening

683
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:40,400
for everything

684
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:42,320
that's included and also totally will

685
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,880
give you details about how to implement

686
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:45,039
it best

687
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:47,200
i mentioned web here still now they will

688
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:49,120
only give you hints of what to change

689
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,960
but that's already incorporated in the

690
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:53,840
developer tool that we have

691
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,960
and why i was mentioning that i'm the

692
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:57,199
first

693
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,720
person with problems here i have at work

694
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,799
two different operating system

695
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,840
a laptop and two machines and i have two

696
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:04,240
screens for the machine

697
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:05,199
and i always find this coloring pairings

698
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:08,320
between them

699
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:10,320
i know a normal person would change the

700
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:12,158
monitor settings to have them correctly

701
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:13,120
but of course i kept it because i wanted

702
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:15,039
to find bugs

703
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:16,879
and i was just moving from one screen to

704
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:17,360
another to see the differences in color

705
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,440
and

706
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:20,479
i realize it's an accessibility issues

707
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:24,880
and of course

708
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:26,799
devices um mobile devices and others

709
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,080
i mentioned earlier that stefan does a

710
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:29,918
really cool

711
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:31,199
work on that and he has a really

712
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:33,279
resourceful page with

713
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,559
links to understanding why different

714
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:37,200
technical implementation

715
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:37,760
what tools are the best and opinions

716
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,799
from

717
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:43,440
both administrative person or just

718
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:45,360
developers and as i mentioned now

719
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,960
firefox developer tool and i've linked

720
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,799
there a page for the community and how

721
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:51,919
you can contribute more

722
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:52,960
i mentioned the talk earlier held by

723
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:55,840
gabriella

724
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:57,919
he did show tips and tricks to create a

725
00:24:55,840 --> 00:25:01,039
better accessibility front-end

726
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:03,360
pages and from 12 15 we have more on the

727
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:05,440
developer tools the new profiler

728
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:06,639
and it's not by gabrielle it's by nazim

729
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:09,840
sorry for my mistake

730
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:12,559
but you'll find it in the schedule and

731
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,879
if one thing is one thing i wanted to

732
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:14,480
leave

733
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,919
this room with is that we should

734
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:17,200
definitely be the leaders

735
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:18,799
and of course i had to put the fox

736
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,440
because they are really cute especially

737
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:21,918
this one

738
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:24,080
don't be the ship be the leading fox in

739
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:26,799
your work

740
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:28,559
and because we are at the open free and

741
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:30,080
open conference we should definitely

742
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:32,158
keep the all information open from

743
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:35,199
everyone and we should not block

744
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:36,320
uh their access thank you very much you

745
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:39,360
see the slides

746
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:42,399
at the bitly link and a very

747
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:46,399
thoughtful quote from tim berners-lee

748
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:48,799
from v3c and now around four questions

749
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,799
thank you

750
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:59,360
so questions

751
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:02,000
i see you i see you living i'm kidding

752
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:02,000
have a good day

753
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:05,520
uh hi thank you very much for your talk

754
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:08,158
um

755
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:09,520
i'm from france and we have a national

756
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:12,159
can you speak a bit louder

757
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:12,960
sure uh i'm from france and we have a

758
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:16,480
national

759
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:19,520
guidelines inspired by the wcag

760
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:20,320
it's the ara and i had the formation a

761
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:23,520
couple of years

762
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:24,000
ago and the teacher told us like 40

763
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:26,639
percent

764
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,400
only of the criteria of this official

765
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:30,559
document and accessibility

766
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:32,559
can be automated like there could be

767
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:35,918
automated criteria so

768
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:38,480
at the time i understood that it was

769
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:39,679
the case we need human analysis on

770
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:42,080
websites

771
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:43,039
for activity do you think it's still the

772
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,799
case

773
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:47,440
and just a second question quickly

774
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:49,200
quickly do you think that the mario

775
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:51,679
the multitude of tools around

776
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:54,320
accessibility is a bad thing

777
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:55,200
or what there are many browser

778
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:57,840
extensions

779
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,400
tools around accessibility and feels to

780
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:02,158
me that

781
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:04,240
efforts are split around many projects

782
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:05,760
and i'm not sure it's the best what are

783
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:08,480
your thoughts about this

784
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:09,440
so first to address the automated part

785
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:11,279
of course there are

786
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:13,200
extensions to change your code and to

787
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:15,520
improve it i showed a view of them

788
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:17,679
also on their side of the users there

789
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:20,240
are many tools to read the screen to

790
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:21,760
change the color contrast i'm always

791
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:24,240
laughing because the library that i use

792
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:25,520
back in romania has this color brand

793
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,720
version of the website and they

794
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:29,120
literally implemented

795
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:30,240
turning everything in black background

796
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:33,199
and yellow as a

797
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:33,679
right like again we are 20 20. having a

798
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:36,640
page

799
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:37,279
black with written in yellow it kills my

800
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:40,399
eyes i'm like

801
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:41,360
downgrading my vision so that's a bad

802
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:43,039
side of it so

803
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:44,959
indeed some of the tools can automate

804
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:47,039
this but it's not in perfect way

805
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:48,720
and i agree with you when you say that

806
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:49,200
there are too many and i agree that this

807
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,679
is

808
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,320
bringing a bad impact because like

809
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:53,919
everything

810
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:55,520
having more devices on android for

811
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:57,360
example makes it even harder to have a

812
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,720
good page for all of the hardware

813
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:00,799
all of the screens all of the

814
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:02,080
manufacturers everything

815
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:03,840
exactly with the same with the tools

816
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,320
having them so many and these parts and

817
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,158
not

818
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:07,360
all of them address all of the issues on

819
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:08,960
accessibility

820
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:10,559
and if you choose one that addresses

821
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:13,679
less of the issues you'll have

822
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:14,720
again a less accessible page so i think

823
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:16,559
it's a bad thing

824
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:18,880
uh i don't think you're going to end up

825
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:21,600
having just one

826
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:22,799
standard in tooling but definitely some

827
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:25,840
of them differentiate

828
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:27,600
and i will go with browser tools because

829
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:29,360
again you don't need anything to add

830
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:31,600
they are literally right there for you

831
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:36,080
and we are moving forward to more

832
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:38,399
web internet i would say my opinion

833
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:40,000
any more questions yes and that's going

834
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:44,559
to be the last because

835
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:46,880
we need to switch speakers afterwards

836
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:47,760
they will call a better version of me

837
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,760
changing speakers

838
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:52,080
are there any accessibility user groups

839
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:54,480
where interested developers

840
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:56,240
could join and where where developers

841
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:58,559
exchange maybe visual impaired

842
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:59,600
could help checking pages which one

843
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:01,840
would you recommend

844
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,799
yeah there are these accessibility clubs

845
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,720
um

846
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:06,080
