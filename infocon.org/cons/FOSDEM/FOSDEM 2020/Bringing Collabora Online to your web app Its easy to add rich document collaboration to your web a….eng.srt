1
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:19,580
bringing calibre online to your weather

2
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:20,689
perfect perfect well thank you for

3
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:22,909
coming 10 seconds

4
00:00:20,689 --> 00:00:24,980
okay well let's count down for three you

5
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:27,230
know Melanie thank you for coming

6
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:28,520
so say caliber online I who knows what

7
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:29,180
it is I mean if you know what it is I

8
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:30,529
don't have to

9
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:32,960
okay well fair enough there are a few

10
00:00:30,529 --> 00:00:35,360
people that don't I'm sorry so

11
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:38,960
collaborative editing imagine Google

12
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:40,039
Docs or Microsoft Office 365 or they

13
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,340
probably you'll get a headache if you

14
00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:44,870
imagine that for too long so we do a

15
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:47,870
document spreadsheet slides viewing

16
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:49,640
collaborative editing phones tablets web

17
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:51,559
all that stuff um brilliant

18
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:54,079
interoperability we are the Microsoft

19
00:00:51,559 --> 00:00:55,879
file format lovers in the look at us we

20
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:58,850
we we have to interoperate with all this

21
00:00:55,879 --> 00:01:00,949
wonderful legacy stuff RTF the legacy of

22
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:03,829
the last standards war you know you may

23
00:01:00,949 --> 00:01:05,570
think ODF is the standards war but RTF

24
00:01:03,829 --> 00:01:06,860
it's the previous standards war and it

25
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:10,100
still lives on in many governments

26
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:12,620
amazingly PDF Visio all sorts of other

27
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:14,330
filters in there are possible and it

28
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:16,430
does WYSIWYG rendering that's quite

29
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:18,080
important because other people don't

30
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:20,360
necessarily like office a word online

31
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,400
doesn't do WYSIWYG anymore it's back to

32
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:25,190
the word five era of not being able to

33
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:27,140
see how your document lays out and I

34
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:28,520
guess the key oh the key thing is that I

35
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:31,130
should get my display to actually

36
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:32,869
project the slides properly so that you

37
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:35,899
can actually see them all that that's

38
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:44,620
probably the the key deliverable at this

39
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:48,980
stage once 1280 800 okay perfect

40
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:50,540
better I think mmm-hmm yes and so it

41
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:52,610
should integrate on-premise with you or

42
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:54,260
your existing EFS SC if you just drop it

43
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:56,630
into one of these things it should work

44
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:58,100
nicely if you're a learning type person

45
00:01:56,630 --> 00:02:00,800
Moodle or something like this matter

46
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:02,809
most um if it doesn't do it yet then

47
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:04,520
well you can come to my talk and I'll

48
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:05,960
show you how I'm so the architecture is

49
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:08,389
really a bet on CPU threads and network

50
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:10,728
getting cheaper we run a chunk of this

51
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:12,920
stuff on the server and so to install

52
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:14,000
that you then just grab a code image

53
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:16,790
you've got packages

54
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,440
you've got docker images for every

55
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:22,910
conceivable Linux distribution of

56
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:24,770
source code and yeah so you um yeah you

57
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:26,690
plug it in and connect to yourself and

58
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:28,700
and fiddle with your web app sometimes

59
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:29,810
people people like to just convert

60
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:32,540
documents so if you want a thumbnail

61
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:37,160
documents or convert documents from you

62
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:38,510
know flat IDs to PDF for invoicing oh we

63
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:42,350
can do that very easily as well so

64
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:44,810
there's a nice REST API there yeah so

65
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:46,310
yeah but but the integration is really

66
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:48,260
just an iframe you you can you can check

67
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:50,720
it out and run it of course like that um

68
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:53,989
but but getting data into it so so this

69
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:55,550
is this kind of this kind of thing this

70
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:56,780
kind of thing okay so it's at the demo

71
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:59,660
stuff that we give you basically loads

72
00:02:56,780 --> 00:03:01,130
files of your file system which is

73
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:02,270
mostly what you don't want to do you

74
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:05,030
want to be able to serve you through

75
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:07,520
this nice API so in terms of

76
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:09,530
understanding this um this is a very

77
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:12,260
simple piece of software we require only

78
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:14,060
Lib C and that's pretty much it of a

79
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:16,940
Linux system we have no dependencies

80
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:19,370
once you include the you know draw a box

81
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:20,930
around the whole bundle so we don't need

82
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:24,230
a database we don't really need the file

83
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:25,489
system very much at all and but we do

84
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:27,679
need to get data so how do we do that

85
00:03:25,489 --> 00:03:29,209
well we store that in say next cloud or

86
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,730
own cloud and we do that through a rest

87
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:34,160
interface which combines authentication

88
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:35,359
and storage so we don't do any

89
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:37,579
authentication I know nothing about

90
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,140
sam'l and I'm very happy about that and

91
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:41,090
I know very little about object

92
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:43,458
databases I'm extremely happy about that

93
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:45,140
and and you know metadata stores and

94
00:03:43,459 --> 00:03:47,239
clustering my hope is that you've done

95
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:48,829
all that already and and you know or you

96
00:03:47,239 --> 00:03:50,300
have a plan for this kind of thing and

97
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:52,340
we don't need to care because you can

98
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:54,440
give us a token and we will give it back

99
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:56,060
to you to prove that it's still us you

100
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:57,380
know and and that's that's basically

101
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:59,200
what what P does see there are two

102
00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:01,970
things - sir there's a Whoopie source

103
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:04,850
which effectively defines the file or

104
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:06,620
the stream it is and its version and so

105
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:08,540
on and then there's a fence occation

106
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:10,940
thing we basically do a post into the

107
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:13,670
iframe that sends those two things

108
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:15,200
separately and then okay so so we want

109
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:17,390
to get a file we call a get on your

110
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,130
storage we do a web get it's that hard

111
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:22,419
okay and we pass these credentials back

112
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:26,210
and you decide and to save we do a post

113
00:04:22,419 --> 00:04:27,740
again tricky stuff and then there's a

114
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:29,870
there is a slightly tricky method check

115
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:31,900
file info here and this allows us to do

116
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:34,900
all sorts of cool thing so it gives

117
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:36,340
of course at roots we could just fail on

118
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:38,020
the get to give the file in terms of

119
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:39,700
permissions management you could go yeah

120
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:41,650
can't give it to you but wouldn't it be

121
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:43,210
nice if you could have read-only various

122
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:45,270
different permissions you know can they

123
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:47,950
comment can the idiot can they read line

124
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:49,750
what's their name where's their avatar

125
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:52,450
URL so we can do this little thing and

126
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:56,050
all of that kind of metadata tends to

127
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:57,490
come back from a check file info so

128
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:59,500
there is the security token obviously I

129
00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:02,700
I guess I mentioned that before we don't

130
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:04,810
care to us it's a totally opaque string

131
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:06,640
but it shouldn't have anything to do

132
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:08,200
with the document so document stuff on

133
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,880
once our sighting uses stuff on the

134
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:12,099
other because everyone that collaborates

135
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:13,570
inside the same document has the same

136
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:15,490
huapi source and that's very important

137
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:17,349
when you come to spreading this over

138
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:21,700
clusters and so on everyone needs to end

139
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:23,500
up on the same night so yeah oh there's

140
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:25,870
a discovery but honestly this doesn't

141
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:27,280
matter like whatever you you can look

142
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:30,520
stuff up in the discovery and do clever

143
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:32,049
things or not but yeah who cares you can

144
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:33,640
just do it directly if you like hard

145
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:38,170
Kate it you know at least least for a

146
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:41,349
prototype so yeah the check file info

147
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:42,790
endpoint yep and you can just get a

148
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:44,470
hello will very easily you have a simple

149
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:46,480
an HTML document that looks well a bit

150
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:47,800
like this it's not very big as you can

151
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:49,780
see in there's a form action here and

152
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:52,960
it's got this you know all these details

153
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:56,820
that go across and bingo there you are

154
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:59,140
um yeah I think that's pretty much

155
00:05:56,820 --> 00:06:00,760
pretty much the works now of course once

156
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:04,090
you've got it embedded and it's looking

157
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:05,710
beautiful as it does you then might want

158
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:07,750
to to play around with it unfortunately

159
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:10,900
have time to test my wife demo earlier

160
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:14,050
so it may well not work so I might skip

161
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:15,940
that reasons of time but essentially you

162
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:18,480
can post messages inside and outside and

163
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:20,290
across the frames to do all sorts of

164
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:22,590
exciting things this little demo here

165
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:25,240
that you can grab out of the source and

166
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:26,650
configure as as instructed and so

167
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:28,300
actually we can figure it to do cross

168
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:31,299
site scripting checking by default so

169
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:35,140
you have to add localhost into the the

170
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:37,030
configuration so he can trust itself to

171
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:40,419
do what it does in the demo which is

172
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:41,530
that slightly an elegant thing and then

173
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:43,150
yeah then you can play with it so you

174
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:45,239
can you know hide your menu bars if you

175
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:46,530
don't want menu bars and you can see

176
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:49,560
around stuff you can even inject

177
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:51,239
arbitrary calls to scripts in here so

178
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:53,130
you can send a Python script that runs

179
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:55,860
in the backend and you can generate a

180
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:57,120
form or a report or do your database

181
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:58,380
queries at the site you know there's all

182
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,440
sorts of things you can do with embedded

183
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:03,960
Python there if you want and drive that

184
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:06,569
from the UI and so some people we have a

185
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:08,219
customer that uses this for doing like I

186
00:07:06,569 --> 00:07:10,080
want this area of a spreadsheet I want

187
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:11,729
to select a spreadsheet and I want to

188
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:14,280
dump this somewhere else I want to

189
00:07:11,729 --> 00:07:15,810
dynamically move data into these things

190
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:18,508
not to make them and so that's that's

191
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:20,099
all stuff that you can um you can do and

192
00:07:18,509 --> 00:07:23,729
we have a vast scripting API obviously a

193
00:07:20,099 --> 00:07:25,770
thousand and a thousand interfaces with

194
00:07:23,729 --> 00:07:30,840
God knows how many methods that you can

195
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:32,520
use use from that yeah so you can also

196
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:34,500
add your own toolbar buttons and things

197
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:37,139
people like custom buttons did I mention

198
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:43,110
you can theme it and skin it and CSS to

199
00:07:37,139 --> 00:07:44,849
the end obviously yeah so yes it's

200
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:46,560
obviously worth waiting to the

201
00:07:44,849 --> 00:07:48,780
JavaScript is loaded I think one of the

202
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,699
the great benefits of JavaScript is not

203
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:52,590
knowing what order your JavaScript files

204
00:07:50,699 --> 00:07:53,969
are loaded in and then what they're

205
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:55,888
gonna do when they load in a different

206
00:07:53,969 --> 00:07:57,630
order and not being able really to test

207
00:07:55,889 --> 00:08:00,150
that either sir you know javascript is

208
00:07:57,630 --> 00:08:01,199
just the most wonderful mess in the

209
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:04,500
world when it comes to programming

210
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:06,080
anything it's just a living hell I don't

211
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:07,919
know you know I mean I wrote it was just

212
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,659
you know words fail me

213
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:10,859
you know piling up all the stuff and

214
00:08:09,659 --> 00:08:12,180
then the good news is that they create

215
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:14,490
these tools that make it very easy to

216
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:15,810
upgrade bits of the middle of it where

217
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:19,050
upgrade means break all of the

218
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:21,830
invariants I coded up above so obscure

219
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:23,039
things no longer work but anyway um I

220
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:24,270
digress

221
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,770
either way wait till the JavaScript

222
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:28,740
loaded before sending your post message

223
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:32,458
otherwise you yeah you might have a bad

224
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:34,380
experience so don't do that good

225
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:35,939
so I mention the check file info thing

226
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:37,559
there's a whole load of things that here

227
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:39,120
like say so one of the things we have a

228
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:40,770
thing called secure view I forget if I

229
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,209
go to slide about it but the idea is

230
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:44,550
that the daintily at the document leave

231
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:47,099
your site you know you have employees in

232
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:49,050
in in wherever they are North Korea

233
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:51,959
because you employ North Koreans great

234
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:52,829
great move and yeah you don't want to

235
00:08:51,959 --> 00:08:54,569
send them the whole document you just

236
00:08:52,829 --> 00:08:56,760
want to show show them it and you want

237
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:58,380
to you know watermark it so that you can

238
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:59,130
be sure it's them and if they take

239
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:00,750
pictures of the screen

240
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:02,700
you know it's got their name all over it

241
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:05,370
this kind of thing um so you can turn

242
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:07,650
off printing downloading saving copy

243
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:10,260
paste or all of this stuff because that

244
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:12,360
all happens server-side and so you can

245
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:14,280
just hard disable this stuff which is

246
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:15,600
kind of cool and anyway so there's all

247
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:19,350
sorts of these different options you can

248
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:21,840
do copy paste because actually you're

249
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:23,970
sending pixels to the client not actual

250
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:26,250
content it's relatively easy to do that

251
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:27,690
like there really is no the Dom is all

252
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:29,820
on the server not in the not in the

253
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:31,770
client which has many advantages in

254
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:32,940
terms of performance and you want to do

255
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:35,430
the slow thing not on your mobile phone

256
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:38,310
but on the fast server in the data

257
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:41,010
center probably what do we have here

258
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:42,359
enable owner termination see I don't

259
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:44,090
know ken do you know that this is candy

260
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:46,320
here's who's awesome and you know

261
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:47,810
develop them and manager for Calabria

262
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,280
online you know look at that you'll see

263
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:52,140
extra users oh yes so your you know your

264
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:53,189
avatar and your email and little things

265
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:55,500
so you can then start to integrate with

266
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:57,450
your crazy chat and lalala you can do

267
00:09:55,500 --> 00:10:01,920
all that sort of nice nice integration

268
00:09:57,450 --> 00:10:04,560
stuff yeah csps only wonderful for

269
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:08,310
breaking images and watermarking stuff

270
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:11,010
for watermarking tiles oh yeah I think

271
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:12,599
this is a great thing you know so it's

272
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:13,800
very important so let me show you some

273
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,700
of the other other people that have done

274
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,170
this just to prove that it's not

275
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:18,030
impossible you know

276
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:19,680
so you arrow are great they they're Java

277
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:21,510
programmers so that's good actually

278
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:23,069
having used Java scripts you discover

279
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:24,600
that Java is a beautiful programming

280
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:26,700
language which is funny isn't it you

281
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:29,760
know cuz I was a baroque mess but anyway

282
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:31,200
they were um so II group where they were

283
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,390
doing some stuff here you know just

284
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:36,450
embedded into their their tool their

285
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:38,100
frame um collab who a company that's in

286
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:41,190
Switzerland to do a secure on site

287
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:42,300
on-premise hosted stuff and next grad

288
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:44,580
obviously you've just heard your sis

289
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:46,469
talk a beautiful integration there with

290
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:49,350
all sorts of things avatars and

291
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:51,900
templates and all sorts of all sorts of

292
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:55,130
nice features sharing built-in and so on

293
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:58,500
I'm cloud similarly and another PHP app

294
00:10:55,130 --> 00:11:00,900
pi do as again a PHP but another

295
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:03,210
integrations there a roof some random

296
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:05,069
other you know company producing stuff

297
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:07,500
doing this a matter most for your

298
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:10,410
education educational needs

299
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:11,700
chatting needs rather um this is not a

300
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:12,900
very pretty integration I need to talk

301
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:15,720
to Corey when I see him

302
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:17,730
if I see him to try and fix that and so

303
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:19,020
we love to help people do that so you

304
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:21,480
know when you're struggling and it

305
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:24,600
doesn't work it might not be you you

306
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:26,760
know so so come and come and grab me or

307
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:28,770
someone else and we can help you get

308
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:30,689
this integrated and then you know

309
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:32,010
there's all sorts of commercial stuff

310
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:34,230
around there that we can talk about

311
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:35,910
thank you sir you cannot make any

312
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:37,590
sustainable open-source engagement let's

313
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:39,959
say what else

314
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:41,520
say Culebra line for to say so this is

315
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,750
sort of shipping in code now but these

316
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:46,140
are basically new features we've added

317
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:48,780
in the last six nine nine months

318
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:50,670
something like that so what do we see

319
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:52,439
here well I'm so we got the sidebars now

320
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:54,060
and impress so this is being tunneled

321
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:55,920
through from effectively the PC

322
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:57,510
application and we're moving these two

323
00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:00,449
years some native widgets I think

324
00:11:57,510 --> 00:12:02,160
probably in the next year or so but hey

325
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:03,990
it works really nicely for now so you

326
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,339
have really quite rich functionality

327
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:07,560
there all these different panels you can

328
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:09,960
be fiddling with a shadow of your text

329
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:12,599
box and so on it's just a huge a wealth

330
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:14,430
of functionality there animations I

331
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,780
don't think anyone else has configurable

332
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:17,520
animations in their online office suite

333
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:18,870
at the moment you know and all of that

334
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:21,750
all of the key stuff that you want then

335
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:23,280
around presentations so you can you can

336
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:25,710
actually make a presentation master

337
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:27,240
pages master page editing Google Docs

338
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:28,020
doesn't do it Microsoft Office doesn't

339
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:30,030
do it

340
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:31,920
none of our competition does you know so

341
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:33,689
it's just but again bringing that

342
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:35,670
richness of the functionality from the

343
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:37,860
office suite through to the to the

344
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:39,719
browser and I hope of course is here

345
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:41,490
that we we end up with a full function

346
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:44,070
office suite in the browser that's easy

347
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:46,260
to deploy centrally and it's not just

348
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:49,200
then selling ownCloud to someone it's

349
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:51,810
it's also getting rid of that legacy PC

350
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:53,670
installed nastiness as well so you can

351
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:55,290
start to actually you know in good

352
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:58,130
conscience move to a fully web delivered

353
00:12:55,290 --> 00:13:01,170
extremely secure on-premise hosted

354
00:12:58,130 --> 00:13:03,300
digitally sovereign solution which is

355
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:04,920
nice but what else a nice new chart

356
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:06,689
editing sidebar so you can click on your

357
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:09,630
charts and get different different types

358
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:10,860
of charts conditional formats so often

359
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:12,150
people have these dropdowns and they

360
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:14,730
they claim conditional formatting is

361
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:15,930
done you know pick one and be happy but

362
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:17,280
of course conditional formatting is

363
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:19,469
insanely complicated and you know

364
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:21,780
wouldn't it be nice if you could fix it

365
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:23,640
so it looks like you want it function

366
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:25,589
Wizards so you can remember what the

367
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:26,890
seventeenth parameter to that really bad

368
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:30,050
method does

369
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:33,020
and so on color correction of images

370
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:34,880
nice UI handles for sizing tables and

371
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:37,220
selecting them improved spreadsheet

372
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,750
stuff for auto fills I wouldn't be nice

373
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:40,190
if you write january/february and use

374
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:41,720
fill it down it goes March April May

375
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:43,160
instead of January for every Jennifer

376
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:45,740
you know that kind of thing

377
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:47,689
ordinal suffix first second drag it down

378
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:49,750
third 4/5 you know these things are the

379
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:52,130
basics that our competitors are just

380
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:53,930
anyway they don't have the rich engine

381
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:56,000
behind the scenes to do because that

382
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:57,109
seems easy isn't it first second third

383
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,480
fourth fifth but actually when you get

384
00:13:57,110 --> 00:14:02,810
to you know the plethora of languages we

385
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:04,070
support 119 live translations for

386
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:05,839
languages hundred and forty-five people

387
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:07,940
working four and a half thousand

388
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:08,420
translators working on a translation

389
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:12,220
codebase

390
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:14,990
things are more complex pop-ups for URLs

391
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:16,550
add to make them nice and then bring you

392
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:18,200
all of that to mobile so previously we

393
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:19,520
are we try to provide more desktop

394
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,930
experience on the phone so you could

395
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:23,030
zoom dialogues and things that was

396
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:25,489
pretty yucky um so we went for a more

397
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:27,680
feature week as and we limit the

398
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:30,410
features to say what our competition do

399
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:32,420
and that's a bit crazy but anyway so a

400
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:33,920
viewer by default you see some of these

401
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:35,540
these sort of fairly familiar you know

402
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:37,819
click the button to play the

403
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:39,469
presentation undo redo this is all

404
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:42,350
they're all open source it's in the App

405
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:45,080
Store or collabora office mobile beta

406
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:46,250
you can store it and play with it and

407
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:49,130
then you know this kind of one-handed

408
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:51,410
you know big chunky stuff scrollable but

409
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:54,680
these are actually the sidebars but

410
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:58,400
wrapped and redone with native HTML

411
00:14:54,680 --> 00:15:00,800
widgets with CSS and you know nicely

412
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:02,810
they can all mix hopefully similarly I

413
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,740
show you the chart type sidebar earlier

414
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:06,520
this is the same guy

415
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:08,960
but now scrollable and hierarchical and

416
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:13,040
unlisted and similarly for these these

417
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:15,590
guys too pretty many years yeah lots of

418
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:18,920
individual features I'm running out of

419
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:21,200
time I will have some time for questions

420
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:22,880
I'm new theming so yeah this is a nice

421
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:24,800
bug I should get a better screenshot but

422
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:26,060
anyway the idea is you can use SVG just

423
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:29,300
theme the native stuff so it looks

424
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:32,329
crisper and prettier and works works

425
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:32,900
better doing a similar thing for iOS for

426
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:35,030
tablets

427
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:38,300
done with an finis who is a cool partner

428
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:39,439
of ours in Switzerland and one of the

429
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:40,529
great things about this partner was that

430
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,729
we saw the product with the

431
00:15:40,529 --> 00:15:43,409
good faith to the customer who then

432
00:15:41,729 --> 00:15:46,499
decided they wanted to work offline and

433
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:48,839
that's a bit difficult for a you know

434
00:15:46,499 --> 00:15:50,339
it's kind of minor feature though you

435
00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:52,769
need to add so anyway they get a free

436
00:15:50,339 --> 00:15:54,869
port of Libre Office to iOS for the

437
00:15:52,769 --> 00:15:58,319
price of fur anyway let's not do that

438
00:15:54,869 --> 00:15:59,699
again um but they go you got it you're

439
00:15:58,319 --> 00:16:01,949
gonna please the customer having you at

440
00:15:59,699 --> 00:16:03,988
the end of the day um so we do all sorts

441
00:16:01,949 --> 00:16:05,728
of cool monitoring so Prometheus Bay

442
00:16:03,989 --> 00:16:07,769
text-based polling stuff I don't know

443
00:16:05,729 --> 00:16:10,439
why people like to poll I think it sucks

444
00:16:07,769 --> 00:16:11,909
but polling is cool um I prefer the

445
00:16:10,439 --> 00:16:13,348
WebSocket thing we implemented first so

446
00:16:11,909 --> 00:16:15,059
you can get live data coming in here

447
00:16:13,349 --> 00:16:16,499
about documents opens who's done it and

448
00:16:15,059 --> 00:16:17,939
whatever from your cluster so the

449
00:16:16,499 --> 00:16:19,439
cluster will connect out your monitoring

450
00:16:17,939 --> 00:16:23,669
server give you a WebSocket and let you

451
00:16:19,439 --> 00:16:25,409
control it lots of other stuff much

452
00:16:23,669 --> 00:16:26,269
richer copy and paste things new

453
00:16:25,409 --> 00:16:29,279
dialogues

454
00:16:26,269 --> 00:16:30,479
yeah lots of anonymize logging so you

455
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,649
had all this nice logging so you can

456
00:16:30,479 --> 00:16:33,569
work out what's going on and then you

457
00:16:31,649 --> 00:16:36,719
encrypt it also you can't anymore with

458
00:16:33,569 --> 00:16:38,218
gdpr compliance they call this obviously

459
00:16:36,719 --> 00:16:40,439
have third party penetration testing to

460
00:16:38,219 --> 00:16:43,349
make sure it's all you know safe and

461
00:16:40,439 --> 00:16:48,779
good better performance PDF rendering

462
00:16:43,349 --> 00:16:50,279
simpler code for your threads yeah ah so

463
00:16:48,779 --> 00:16:52,319
legal sovereignty donor your documents

464
00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:54,209
out of your site highly secure lock it

465
00:16:52,319 --> 00:16:56,848
up on your premise right stick your

466
00:16:54,209 --> 00:16:58,738
document in its own chroot with almost

467
00:16:56,849 --> 00:17:01,019
no file system nothing executable in

468
00:16:58,739 --> 00:17:02,819
there set comp BPF filtering all the

469
00:17:01,019 --> 00:17:05,279
system calls around it I'm underneath

470
00:17:02,819 --> 00:17:06,628
that you know load crash testing in you

471
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:10,319
know we've got a better Coverity school

472
00:17:06,628 --> 00:17:10,948
than the Linux kernel 0.00 questionable

473
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:13,918
if that's useful

474
00:17:10,949 --> 00:17:15,600
um Libre Office kits so basically what

475
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:17,879
about this giant thing is it is it

476
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:20,668
secure we have never had a security

477
00:17:17,878 --> 00:17:23,069
issue inside these documents that could

478
00:17:20,669 --> 00:17:24,869
have broken out like that so it's it's

479
00:17:23,069 --> 00:17:27,299
pretty kind pretty cool and you can

480
00:17:24,868 --> 00:17:28,438
really be confident that it's a picture

481
00:17:27,299 --> 00:17:30,450
of secure view I didn't if you can see

482
00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:32,549
the watermark in the background here but

483
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:34,049
yeah the contrast is not ideal but you

484
00:17:32,549 --> 00:17:35,549
can see it here of course we try and

485
00:17:34,049 --> 00:17:37,320
work on all all kinds of background and

486
00:17:35,549 --> 00:17:39,720
this is a very simple elegant model

487
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:42,149
against Microsoft's Microsoft's model

488
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:44,460
for DRM and sharing documents is that

489
00:17:42,149 --> 00:17:45,899
they sign everything they sign your you

490
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:47,610
know the TPA their key ships in your

491
00:17:45,899 --> 00:17:48,809
BIOS they sign your bootloader they sign

492
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:50,820
your operating system they sign your

493
00:17:48,809 --> 00:17:53,340
office suite and then they'll give you

494
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:54,000
the document the key for your document

495
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:56,580
from there

496
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,290
cloud so you can unlock your documents

497
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:59,699
and be able to read it because they're

498
00:17:58,290 --> 00:18:02,780
now convinced that your whole stack from

499
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:04,650
the hardware app is actually safe

500
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:06,600
anything that's a great model in terms

501
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:07,890
of digital sovereignty I think having a

502
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:09,959
single American company hold all the

503
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:12,600
keys for your documents and sign

504
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:14,370
everything is is just not very elegant

505
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:16,260
let's say it's not very simple it can't

506
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:18,330
be federated and it has this massive

507
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:21,780
central point of failure and we can do

508
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:23,250
better in a simple way that's federated

509
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:24,840
that you own that you control you can

510
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:26,580
decide who you trust who you collaborate

511
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:28,500
with and who you give what permissions

512
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:30,899
to and we think that's extremely elegant

513
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:32,730
our competition instantly claimed to do

514
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:35,700
some of these things but it's all

515
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:37,770
enforced in JavaScript on the client so

516
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:42,510
hard to circumvent by pressing f12

517
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:44,639
obviously yeah highly scalable very

518
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:46,710
simple architecture no database no

519
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:49,290
separate message barse no shared data

520
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:53,250
storage scalability one on one using it

521
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:55,379
for millions of users literally yeah

522
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:56,750
compensable operations suck if you want

523
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:59,370
to know more talk to me about it

524
00:18:56,750 --> 00:19:00,630
45,000 users well actually don't talk to

525
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:02,419
me about it just consider sorting a

526
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:04,770
spreadsheet and changing a cell and

527
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:06,900
trying to work out what the implications

528
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:08,670
of changing the cell are by walking the

529
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:11,640
entire dependency graph that could be

530
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:13,830
vast to see if this cell change effects

531
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:16,080
anything that might impact the salt and

532
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:18,510
now try composing these operations

533
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:19,710
across each other okay and when you've

534
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:21,240
sorted that out you can come and tell me

535
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:24,360
how great operational transforms are

536
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:26,100
good so we just do everything live as it

537
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:28,740
happens and that turns out to be simple

538
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:30,780
slick bulletproof and not have any oh I

539
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:33,440
can't synchronize across my cluster

540
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:36,660
properly um so in terms of CPU usage

541
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:39,740
this is pretty simple 45,000 users using

542
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:42,180
it their spikes of about 6k users online

543
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:43,860
occasionally it runs on the spare

544
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:47,070
Hardware left over or the side of the

545
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:49,320
massive next cloud cluster so like the

546
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:52,980
balance of hardware spent versus the

547
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:54,780
database metadata storages trivial do it

548
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:58,770
doing the data center not on your mobile

549
00:19:54,780 --> 00:20:00,120
if it's complicated and that's it so our

550
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:01,740
mission is to make open-source rock and

551
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:03,090
hopefully we're doing it we'd love to

552
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:05,280
work with you to integrate with you all

553
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:06,399
the efforts so thank you you'd be very

554
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:11,590
good

555
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:13,170
I think we have about half a minute for

556
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:16,090
questions doing this all right

557
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:18,280
no.5 we have five minutes for questions

558
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:19,449
ah I'm very happy that's good I could

559
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:20,980
have gone more slowly let me tell you

560
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:40,240
more conclusions than me sir your

561
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:41,590
question yes see obviously you don't

562
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,870
want to start your document the bit

563
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:45,070
inside the frame well maybe you do but

564
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:46,989
if you'd use the office suite to do that

565
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:49,750
so rendering that on the server is not a

566
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:52,270
problem in terms of theming the widgets

567
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:54,760
there's SVG for doing the icon so you

568
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:56,950
can fiddle around with that's fine it's

569
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:58,960
a subset of SVG because we don't really

570
00:20:56,950 --> 00:21:00,910
want the animated JavaScript stuff

571
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:05,110
running on the server there obviously

572
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:07,510
it's a very restricted subset so I'm you

573
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:09,428
can't CSS everything is the answer but

574
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:21,040
on the mobile it's much more Kenny can't

575
00:21:09,429 --> 00:21:27,700
be given good answer can you open

576
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:29,530
document editors dev room yep so yes if

577
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:31,420
you want to go to that Pedro who is our

578
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:32,920
designer we'll show you how to do the

579
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:35,230
whole works and if not we just slides

580
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:37,780
afterwards um say yes say there's a lot

581
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:39,850
you can do and there are some limits to

582
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:41,590
particular around the legacy dialogues I

583
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:44,860
think in a year as we start to move

584
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:48,189
those to being more client-side rendered

585
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:50,139
HTML dialogues then knock yourself out

586
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:51,640
let's let's do every bad idea of blink

587
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:53,500
tags and you know whatever else and then

588
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:55,690
just pile it in and then yeah but yeah

589
00:21:53,500 --> 00:22:00,600
yeah it's it's easy easy to do good

590
00:21:55,690 --> 00:22:00,600
question another question sir

591
00:22:02,289 --> 00:22:13,220
sure Oh the pay customer is very easy

592
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:16,340
you just mail it to support a clever or

593
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:18,380
officer come oh yes how do I file report

594
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:19,639
bugs so if you just mail us it

595
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:25,730
effectively creates a ticket as you do

596
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:26,179
that and we track that ticket yes to a

597
00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:27,650
degree

598
00:22:26,179 --> 00:22:30,140
yeah so that's kind of split between us

599
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:33,500
and next Klout if you're having problems

600
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:34,340
with that cab poke pick me just just

601
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:37,159
email me or mails

602
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:41,209
just mail me it's probably best and then

603
00:22:37,159 --> 00:22:42,890
we'll we'll sort it out but yes yes they

604
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:45,140
mean it next time moves at a great pace

605
00:22:42,890 --> 00:22:48,490
and innovates quickly let's say say I

606
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:52,280
think this yeah there's things we can

607
00:22:48,490 --> 00:22:54,080
things we can fix that but yeah do love

608
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:58,090
to you yeah you I'll give you a card in

609
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:58,090
a second other questions sir

610
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:21,270
sure so so so so so is it working fine

611
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:21,270
you want to do monitoring essentially

612
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:29,110
yep so when you do a make run like this

613
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:32,110
it gives you these these wonderful

614
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:35,919
things here and so if you just launched

615
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:39,219
the link then you have you know an

616
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:42,070
office suite you know and if you have a

617
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:43,720
new window you can do this and you can

618
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:45,220
see you know collaborative editing or

619
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:47,200
you know whatever it is you like right

620
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:49,000
so so that works reasonably and of

621
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,290
course there's an admin console so if

622
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,270
you as I say if you like the whole

623
00:23:50,290 --> 00:23:55,270
here's a whole lot of quite boring

624
00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:57,430
variables saying you can do that or you

625
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:59,080
can go to the the live admin console

626
00:23:57,430 --> 00:24:00,820
that'll tell you there's you know this

627
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:03,429
many documents open and who's who's

628
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:06,010
doing it and okay so this integration is

629
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:17,890
not cool for the files and the users are

630
00:24:06,010 --> 00:24:19,060
online and so on okay potentially I'm

631
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:20,260
the problem with this command of course

632
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:21,429
is for a development edition we're not

633
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:23,490
really eager for people to be able to

634
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:26,230
load things off the file system normally

635
00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:27,610
so that's kind of disabled in and builds

636
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:31,380
but you can go to the admin console if

637
00:24:27,610 --> 00:24:31,379
you're a glutton for punishment and I am

638
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:38,440
so if you give the user one kill which

639
00:24:36,370 --> 00:24:39,790
is a great great API and then it

640
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:42,220
essentially dumps its entire internal

641
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:44,950
state all of its sockets all of the file

642
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:47,800
descriptors who they go to what's in the

643
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:50,680
tile cache you know when it last saved

644
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:53,470
all the permissions about it and that's

645
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:55,900
quite nice for various reasons this is

646
00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:57,820
used to debug complex threading

647
00:24:55,900 --> 00:25:01,630
situations and in consequence it takes

648
00:24:57,820 --> 00:25:03,310
almost no locks almost all the time

649
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:04,450
that's absolutely fine and it's

650
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:06,820
extremely useful when someone's

651
00:25:04,450 --> 00:25:10,480
deadlocked in a thread however it may

652
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:13,419
crash your server so I it doesn't crash

653
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:14,920
mine at least very often but just be

654
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:17,460
aware that sending a user one is

655
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:19,310
