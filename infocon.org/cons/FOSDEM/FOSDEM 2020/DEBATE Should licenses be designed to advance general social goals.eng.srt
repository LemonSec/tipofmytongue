00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:08,720
all right let's get started with the

2
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:11,440
next debate which is

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:14,320
should licenses be designed to advance

4
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:15,838
general social goals we have

5
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,480
john sullivan molly de blanc james

6
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:21,680

7
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:24,480
so i will uh

8
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,480

11
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,520
all right but i have a mic right i

12
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,839
haven't like it's working is this

13
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,840
working

14
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:51,569
[Music]

15
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:59,839
i would hand it to you but it will burn

16
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,839
me if i touch it

17
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,320
let me get my timer

18
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:13,840
yeah literally

19
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,680
hello everybody i'm john sullivan the

20
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,000
executive director and vice president of

21
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,159
the free

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,520
software foundation uh but like the

23
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:31,360
slide says

24
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,880
what i'm saying here has no relation to

25
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:35,600
what i actually think

26
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:37,039
individually or what the fsf thinks i

27
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,960
want to say that in the november issue

28
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,320
of the fsf bulletin newsletter i

29
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,839
actually wrote an article

30
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,960
that starts to try and address some of

31
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,479
these topics so if you're looking for

32
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,479
what i actually think

33
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:47,920
that's a that's a good place to look but

34
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,960
i very much appreciate this debate

35
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,479
format

36
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,640
i think it helps me understand other

37
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:54,479
people's feelings perspectives

38
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,479
and positions a lot better it helps me

39
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:58,000
determine my own positions

40
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:59,520
and helps improve my critical thinking

41
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,960
and believe me that needs a lot of

42
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,679
improvement

43
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,479
um so with all that in mind molly dash

44
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,360
and

45
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:08,878
i stand resolved that yes licenses

46
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:12,080
should be designed to advance

47
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:12,079
general social goals

48
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,399
we're discussing this topic because

49
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:17,040
there have been multiple new licenses

50
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,640
written

51
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,640
which are largely in the spirit of free

52
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:23,359
software and that they allow

53
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:25,040
much more sharing modification and use

54
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,319
than typical default copyright law

55
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,560
allows

56
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:30,480
but they also include provisions seeking

57
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,120
to prevent certain harms to society the

58
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,679
environment

59
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,360
humanity and we're not here to

60
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,800
necessarily defend any of the particular

61
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,599
licenses or even

62
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:41,280
the idea that the best approach is to

63
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:42,799
tackle these problems through individual

64
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,080
separate licenses

65
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,920
but i want to run down some quick

66
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,800
examples of some of the recent ones and

67
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,359
the harms that they're seeking to

68
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,800
address

69
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,640
kind of set the stage for what we're

70
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,560
talking about

71
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,000
so we have the problem of climate change

72
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,519
which as we know will end the planet

73
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,360
unless we do something

74
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:58,959
citation needed but sure but look at the

75
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,800
weather outside at fosdem that's not

76
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:03,040
right

77
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,959
we all know it um the atmosphere license

78
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,280
that lewis mentioned seeks to address

79
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:07,599
this

80
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,319
by requiring you to divest certain kinds

81
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:10,959
of

82
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:12,238
investments and fossil fuels if you want

83
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:15,200
to use the software

84
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:16,640
the precondition second of all we have

85
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,799
labor exploitation

86
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,799
the anti-996 license which is immensely

87
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:23,200
popular i think it's the number two

88
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,799
starred project on github right now

89
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,399
um says you cannot use the software

90
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:27,920
unless you comply with good labor

91
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,920
standards which do not include forcing

92
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,839
your employees to work 9 a.m to 9 p.m

93
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,559
six days a week

94
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,599
licenses are supposed to ensure that

95
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,000
people have

96
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:39,679
freedom while using the software but can

97
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,879
we really say that people

98
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:45,760
being forced to work 72 hours a week

99
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:46,319
have the freedom necessary to have the

100
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,518
freedom

101
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:51,119
to modify uh share distributed software

102
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:53,040
as compared to the people who have power

103
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,000
over them who can in fact use that

104
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,920
software

105
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,959
um to enhance their exploitation over

106
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,559
the people they already had some amount

107
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:01,439
of control over

108
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:03,120
we have vaccines uh we have infectious

109
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:04,480
diseases we know they have caused

110
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,239
you know massive amount of death over

111
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,959
history that's that that's why we have

112
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:09,120
vaccines and

113
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,560
and why people take them people refusing

114
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,159
to take vaccines

115
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,000
uh cause other people put other people

116
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:15,679
at risk of dying the vaccine

117
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,120
license says you have to get vaccinated

118
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,120
and make sure that everybody under your

119
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:22,320
legal control also gets vaccinated

120
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,520
before you can use the software

121
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,520
the final example i have is

122
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:27,520
militarization that militaries

123
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,719
and police departments are actually

124
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,320
using free software

125
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,400
to violate other people's rights and

126
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:35,520
kill them that's not good

127
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,638
so various licenses seek to forbid that

128
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,198
specific use

129
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:40,160
of the software or distribution to

130
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:42,479
entities

131
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,000
known to engage in that kind of uh

132
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:45,599
activity

133
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,199
we need we need to be reasonably we need

134
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,080
to be alive and we need to be reasonably

135
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:49,919
healthy

136
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,359
in order to have any kind of meaningful

137
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:52,560
freedom when we're interacting with

138
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,639
software if we're dead we don't have

139
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,320
software freedom

140
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:58,240
uh nor if we're melting or you know

141
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:00,080
drowning from sea level rise

142
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,199
we also need to be free in other ways in

143
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,320
order to be able to exercise our

144
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:03,759
software freedom

145
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,360
and we inherited militaries and we need

146
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:07,360
our police forces to behave ethically in

147
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,960
order to have a democratic society to

148
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,759
begin with

149
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,799
so what we're seeing with these licenses

150
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,960
is that

151
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,400
you know first of all they use the law

152
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,799
to prevent

153
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,799
uh the software from being used directly

154
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:23,360
for bad things

155
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:25,280
and second of all they're doing things

156
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,960
to create incentives or leverage to

157
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,638
discourage bad behavior and encourage

158
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,440
good behavior you can't use the software

159
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,360
unless you

160
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,880
act in a certain way which is beneficial

161
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,080
to society

162
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,400
and important for avoiding really

163
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:38,159
catastrophic kinds of harm

164
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,758
and yes there are other ways to address

165
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,680
these problems there are laws

166
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:43,600
uh there's economic incentives are

167
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,320
purchasing power boycotts things like

168
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,320
that

169
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:48,000
but just because there are other tools

170
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,520
doesn't mean we shouldn't use all the

171
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,199
tools that we have available

172
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,639
especially when the consequences are so

173
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:55,199
extreme

174
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:56,720
and especially because we can use

175
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:59,199
multiple things in parallel they don't

176
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:01,600
compete with each other

177
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,560
and in fact people are turning to

178
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,800
software licenses

179
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:07,600
because other kinds of tools are not

180
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:09,600
working or are not working fast enough

181
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,199
and software licenses are something that

182
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,720
individuals have very direct control

183
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:14,880
over and also make a very clear

184
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,560
statement if you decide not to buy

185
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,960
mcdonald's does not know that i do not

186
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,240
eat at mcdonald's i promise you

187
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,239
that is not sending them any kind of

188
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,840
message but if i put their name and a

189
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,440
software license and they see that then

190
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,638
they know exactly what kind of behavior

191
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:29,120
you know i or another developer is

192
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:30,960
objecting to

193
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:33,039
um and let's remember also the companies

194
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,000
aren't people they don't have individual

195
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:35,039
rights

196
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,080
uh because they don't have the

197
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:37,599
accountability that comes with an

198
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,719
individual rights either

199
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,160
and also even when it comes to

200
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,680
individuals we accept certain kinds of

201
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,800
restrictions on our freedom

202
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,639
and the interest of private in the

203
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,800
interest of safety and security you

204
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,560
can't shout fire in a crowded theater

205
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,960
and you can't use my software to destroy

206
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,960
the planet

207
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:55,599
these licenses indicate that people are

208
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:58,560
very interested in the ethics

209
00:06:55,599 --> 00:07:00,400
of technology and software things that

210
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,039
are you know at the heart of free

211
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,560
software

212
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:04,639
so to tell these new ethical hector

213
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:07,599
hackers to get off our lawn and go read

214
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:09,680
do that org philosophy is uh not gonna

215
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:11,120
help

216
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,400
we should encourage their participation

217
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,840
even if we think that it might be

218
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,919
imperfect

219
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,960
and you know maybe if we listen instead

220
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:18,719
of talk

221
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,080
uh then if we're welcoming these social

222
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,039
goal licenses end up being a stepping

223
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,758
stone

224
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:24,318
towards traditional free licenses like

225
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:25,440
some people

226
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,960
argue that creative commons

227
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,960
non-commercial licenses are a way to get

228
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,638
people more accustomed to the idea of

229
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,919
sharing their work more and then

230
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:35,360
eventually they become more comfortable

231
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:35,359
enough to use fully free licenses

232
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,199
and you know sure there might be some

233
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:40,880
problems with this approach the negative

234
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:42,319
team will tell us all about them

235
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,080
but i don't think these problems will be

236
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:46,960
world ending or

237
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,919
threatening the planet on a global scale

238
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,520
and i think the problems that we're

239
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:52,000
talking about actually are

240
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:57,979
so we better try harder and we should

241
00:07:52,000 --> 00:08:03,279
use licenses to do it

242
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:03,279
[Applause]

243
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:15,758
okay all very very persuasive

244
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:21,440
the first question that i that i have

245
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,719
for you uh draws on a question that came

246
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,599
up a little earlier in the previous

247
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,800
discussion

248
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:29,840
which is uh how do we handle

249
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:32,159
shifting norms around ethics

250
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,598
because sometimes ethics shift in a

251
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,640
positive direction sometimes they

252
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:36,240
regress

253
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,159
and that depends on where you are in the

254
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:41,200
world as well

255
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:44,800
if we are to codify ethics and

256
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:46,480
a license um

257
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,439
how do we how do we make room for the

258
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,240
fact that those things are going to

259
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,240
drift over time

260
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:54,640
yeah i think that's a fair question but

261
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,519
i don't think it's that much different

262
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,439
from how we

263
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:59,680
deal with that in our laws you know and

264
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:02,560
i think that licenses in fact are

265
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:04,319
are more flexible than many other kinds

266
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:06,000
of instruments that try to

267
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,240
address ethical questions you know

268
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,519
religious texts foundational

269
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,000
philosophical texts

270
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:13,600
statutes these things all have to be

271
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,760
revisited and

272
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,120
i think that we've had the benefit of

273
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,640
living with software licenses free

274
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,000
software licenses that have had

275
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,519
great staying power and been around for

276
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,279
a long time but it doesn't necessarily

277
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:25,040
have to be that way

278
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:27,360
we could put out a new edition of gpl

279
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,360
over here

280
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,480
that sounds very representative

281
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:40,000
along those same lines how do we if

282
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:42,800
if we are to make room for advancing

283
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:46,000
general social goals through licenses

284
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:48,640
how do we prevent uh regressive

285
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,760
ethics uh from from entering those

286
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:52,959
licenses

287
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:55,839
so what do you mean by regression so

288
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:57,279
at the license that may be uh given the

289
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:59,040
culture that it's created in might

290
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:01,360
restrict uh reproductive autonomy for

291
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,360
instance

292
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,800
well i think that's kind of similar to

293
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,519
the first question and that you know

294
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,120
ethics are

295
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:08,640
their territory for disagreement and we

296
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,480
have to have ways to

297
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,680
you know have conversations about that

298
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:15,519
and

299
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:17,120
on one hand you know licenses there's

300
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:18,399
other people will not use them unless

301
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,320
they agree with the stances that are

302
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:22,480
taken there so there's kind of the basic

303
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,800
democracy aspect and then maybe we have

304
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:27,279
bodies that are responsible for

305
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,800
you know that are end up being trusted

306
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:30,320
for making decisions about which kinds

307
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,920
of provisions are acceptable and

308
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,600
licenses licenses

309
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:36,560
and which aren't and the conversations

310
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:39,920
can happen under their umbrella

311
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:42,560
so lastly as we pursue more

312
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:44,959
ethical technology and more just world

313
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:47,199
which are all lotable goals

314
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:48,239
how do we uh work against how do we

315
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,279
weigh against the unintended

316
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,800
consequences

317
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:52,320
knowing that there are projects that are

318
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,000
built on the foundations of the four

319
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,800
freedoms and the open source definition

320
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,480
today

321
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,399
that are making a dent in these problems

322
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:01,600
how do we how do we know

323
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:04,800
that uh adding ethics to the licenses

324
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:06,240
will not uh adversely

325
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,479
detract from those efforts that already

326
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:12,000
exist

327
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:13,120
um well we have to i mean that's kind of

328
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,720
the question about keeping them up to

329
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:29,519
date and revising them

330
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:31,990
i think thanks i'm so glad to hear that

331
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:34,240
we're ready for gplv4 i have some ideas

332
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:36,800
[Laughter]

333
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,800
seven minutes

334
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:42,640
so it has become uh fashionable to start

335
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:45,120
this talk with a disclaimer

336
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:46,880
that you i don't really believe any of

337
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,800
the things i'm about to say

338
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,480
i barely mean these words as they come

339
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,120
out of my mouth you cannot hold me to

340
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,639
them

341
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:55,120
at any point in time so we've had a lot

342
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:57,519
of

343
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,160
community discussion over the last few

344
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:00,560
months

345
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:02,880
around this question of what is the role

346
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:05,439
of ethics in licenses

347
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:06,720
what is the right place to locate ethics

348
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:10,000
in our community

349
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:12,560
and nobody up here and probably nobody

350
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,320
in the audience thinks that there is a

351
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,760
reason why we should not have any ethics

352
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,360
at all in the work that we do

353
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:19,360
and the question really today is just

354
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,920
why would we put them in licenses or why

355
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:24,800
wouldn't we put them in licenses

356
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:26,319
and our position on this side of the

357
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:28,719
stage

358
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,360
is that the licenses are the wrong place

359
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,839
to put

360
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,480
the ethics because there are better

361
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:34,800
places

362
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,760
and putting the ethics in the licenses

363
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,800
makes your job

364
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:40,079
harder not easier it's not only less

365
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,359
effective than some of these other ways

366
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:44,319
of going about it

367
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:45,440
it's ineffective so let me talk about

368
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:48,079
that a little bit right

369
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:49,279
we have all of these licenses right i

370
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:52,638
know people in this room

371
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:55,200
really care about licenses but i don't

372
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:57,440
give a about licenses

373
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,959
i think licenses are kind of stupid i've

374
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,800
spent a lot of time thinking about them

375
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:04,239
i spent a lot of time working on them

376
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:07,279
and i regret every second of it

377
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:09,839
i have wasted years of my life

378
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:11,360
thinking about the least consequential

379
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:12,880
end

380
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,720
of the free and open source software

381
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:17,600
world

382
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,240
right the the magic in the freedom we

383
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,760
get

384
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,120
is not in the freedom it's what we do

385
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,680
with it it's in the collaboration that

386
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,839
we have

387
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,800
it's in the people we meet we talk to we

388
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:27,360
work with

389
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,959
we get to do things together that are

390
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,760
greater than what we could ever do alone

391
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:34,880
and it's not because of licenses

392
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:37,600
we don't really use the licenses

393
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,959
half an hour ago people tried to recite

394
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,399
the four freedoms the people on the

395
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:42,719
stage tried to recite the four freedoms

396
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:45,519
it was a lot of

397
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:47,360
i don't know if i can count that high i

398
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:49,760
can't recite the four freedoms

399
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,560
i don't know what they are i've read the

400
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,839
licenses

401
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:53,920
every time i have a question about them

402
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:54,320
i have to go back to them who here has

403
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:58,319
actually

404
00:13:54,320 --> 00:14:03,839
read gplv3 all the way through liars

405
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:03,839
lawyers all of you put your hands down

406
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:09,920
even if you did read it i bet you just

407
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,680
skimmed it

408
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,800
and i bet you didn't even understand it

409
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:15,599
because it's not written to be

410
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,599
comprehensible

411
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:18,079
right

412
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:24,399
we have these licenses they're like

413
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,639
flags that we wave

414
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:27,839
we point at them we think they we all

415
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:28,959
think we know what they mean but they

416
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,480
each mean a different thing

417
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:31,839
to each of us we have no common

418
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,519
understanding of what they mean because

419
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:35,040
we never test the damn things

420
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:37,600
we never take them to court we never

421
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:39,519
litigate them right even when we do

422
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,040
it's a quagmire that we just want to get

423
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:45,040
out of as soon as we get in

424
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:46,079
sorry bradley the whole point of the

425
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:48,240
license is

426
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:49,439
when we get involved in them is not that

427
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,000
we're going to use them to change the

428
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,519
world to make everything better

429
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,839
the point of the licenses is to have a

430
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:57,440
common point around which we can gather

431
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:59,360
and start working together and what

432
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,519
truly controls the behavior

433
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:03,120
of the people around the licenses is the

434
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:04,480
norms in the communities that cohere

435
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:07,440
around them

436
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:09,360
when we get together we decide in this

437
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:12,399
project the gpl means x

438
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:15,040
in that project the gpl means why

439
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:16,399
and they're different things right

440
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,079
people disagree about what these

441
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:19,920
licenses mean and that's okay

442
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:21,920
because in each community where you want

443
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:24,479
to participate

444
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:26,319
you adopt the local definition you adopt

445
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,880
the local norms about all kinds of

446
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,880
things

447
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:31,040
both what's in the license and what's

448
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,920
not right the the codes of standards of

449
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,279
behavior

450
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,719
the way people are going to interact

451
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:36,639
with each other just the method of

452
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:38,839
getting a pull request into a project

453
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:40,079
those are all norms that aren't in the

454
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:42,959
license

455
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:44,560
we enforce those norms by saying if you

456
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:46,479
want to come play with our community

457
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:48,079
if you want to access the value the

458
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:50,639
magic of the collaboration

459
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:52,079
if you want to be here with us you have

460
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:54,000
to behave in a certain way

461
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:55,680
the licenses are not what makes that

462
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,480
happen it's the community that makes

463
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:59,120
that happen

464
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,720
if you want to enforce ethical norms and

465
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,759
standards of behavior around your

466
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,360
software

467
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:05,680
the answer is to build strong

468
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:07,680
communities where there is so much value

469
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:09,199
in participating in that community as a

470
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,959
first class participant

471
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:13,680
that you are going to collaborate

472
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:16,000
alongside with those norms

473
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,719
that is how we have always done license

474
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,560
enforcement

475
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,480
that is how we have always done

476
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:22,239
community enforcement around codes of

477
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:25,199
conduct and behavior and

478
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:26,320
ethics in all sorts of ways that have

479
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:29,599
that have preceded

480
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:31,600
the current set of conversations so that

481
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:34,000
is what we are standing for on this side

482
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:36,480
of the stage is just that notion

483
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,440
that if you want to do licenses you have

484
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,440
to ground it

485
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:41,839
in your community we don't enforce the

486
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,639
licenses we don't actually use that text

487
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:45,519
for anything

488
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:47,839
nobody understands what that text is and

489
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:49,680
so we all end up falling back

490
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:51,440
to this notion of community and it's not

491
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:53,359
perfect right there's always going to be

492
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:55,199
places where that's going to end where

493
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:58,399
your community does not have

494
00:16:55,199 --> 00:17:00,639
the power and the control

495
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:01,920
but the same is true of the licenses

496
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:03,279
right most of the time when there's

497
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,359
license violations

498
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:06,480
nothing ever gets done about it the vast

499
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:08,958
majority

500
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:10,000
of software that doesn't comply with the

501
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:12,000
licenses

502
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,359
we just let it go because the cost of

503
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,119
fighting is so high

504
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:17,280
because the cost of collaboration is so

505
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:19,918
low

506
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,480
and so we end up at a place where if you

507
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:22,319
want

508
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:24,000
ethical enforcement putting it in the

509
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:25,918
license is pointless

510
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,760
unless you have the community behind you

511
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:29,280
putting it in the license is pointless

512
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:32,640
unless you have a strong community that

513
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:34,879
is worth participating in

514
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,840
so why put it in the license what do you

515
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,200
get out of it

516
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:39,360
if you get nothing out of it what does

517
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:41,520
it cost you it costs you

518
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:43,360
the rigidity of being stuck with a bunch

519
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,559
of license terms

520
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:47,520
that might meet the needs of your

521
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:50,799
community today but might not tomorrow

522
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:52,400
right when we were working on gpl v3

523
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:54,080
linus famously said that he couldn't

524
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:57,600
adopt it even if he wanted to

525
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:58,960
now i think he didn't really want to but

526
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:01,439
the point is that he had this large

527
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,880
community of people behind him

528
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:06,080
and getting all of them to sign off and

529
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:08,400
moving to v3 was a non-starter

530
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:10,080
if v2 had included a bunch of ethical

531
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,600
clauses that were no longer relevant to

532
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:14,000
his community

533
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:15,120
he stuck with them right so that's the

534
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,160
problem with licenses

535
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:19,280
they're rigid they're friction once you

536
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,400
start trying to enforce them you're

537
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,000
talking to lawyers

538
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,760
who are not doing you any favors they're

539
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,120
just getting in the way

540
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:27,120
of actually getting people talking

541
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,479
directly to each other which is where

542
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:31,520
the community conversation needs to

543
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,520
happen thank you

544
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,840
given that i would given that i was name

545
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:39,280
checked i would love to do the cross but

546
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,639
i am just the moderator i believe daesh

547
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,600
from the affirmative side will be doing

548
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:44,880
the cross

549
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:46,879
thank you bradley um oh am i still up

550
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:49,039
yes yes thank you james so question you

551
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:51,919
james are all users of open source

552
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:51,919
software ethical

553
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,480
yes yes they are all users of open

554
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:58,799
source exxon

555
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,000
for instance i mean in their use of free

556
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:01,360
software if they're complying with the

557
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,559
license i think they're doing

558
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:05,199
they're they're meeting their ethical

559
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:06,480
obligations comprehensive ethical

560
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,960
obligations

561
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:10,400
like beyond the license yeah oh no the

562
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,799
license goes as far as

563
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:14,320
you know what the license covers and is

564
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:17,039
climate change a good thing

565
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:19,280
no definitely not is child labor a good

566
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:19,280
thing

567
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:28,720
no

568
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:29,600
if you knew that a company was employing

569
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,160
child labor

570
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:33,678
would you have standing to do anything

571
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:36,880
about that

572
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:38,559
i certainly wouldn't if you if that

573
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,160
company was using software

574
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:41,678
that you had licensed to them under a

575
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,919
license that

576
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:45,679
prevents anyone from using the license

577
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:47,360
software should they employ child labor

578
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:48,960
would you not have standing then to

579
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:50,320
enforce that against that company

580
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,160
i don't think i really would have any

581
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,720
ability to do anything about it you know

582
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,520
i'm not a

583
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:57,039
i'm not a child labor crusader right i

584
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:59,280
don't have access to

585
00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:00,640
a whole bunch of lawyers at my disposal

586
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,280
who are going to fight that battle for

587
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,600
me

588
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,960
i don't have access to any of the

589
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,000
resources i would need to fully

590
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,159
understand the situation

591
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,559
to even get into that conversation the

592
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:13,039
notion that i

593
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:16,000
as a random free software hacker who

594
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:17,520
happens to have commits in that tree

595
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,600
and the software happens to be used by

596
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,080
this company is going to have the

597
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,639
ability

598
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:24,080
to even begin legal process let alone

599
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,960
litigate that process through to a

600
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,639
conclusion

601
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:28,400
that harms them more than them just

602
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,760
saying screw it we'll rewrite your

603
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:32,320
commits

604
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:33,200
is farcical right exxon is not going to

605
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:35,520
say oh

606
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:37,360
oh james has 300 lines of code in that

607
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:38,720
tree we'd better listen to him

608
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:40,240
no they're going to hire some guy to

609
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,520
rewrite those 300 lines and tell me to

610
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,440
go screw off

611
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:45,280
stories no there's no scenario in the

612
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,240
world in which i become some sort of

613
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:49,039
effective social

614
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:50,880
justice crusader for children's rights

615
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:52,799
because i have a few commits in a tree

616
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:55,039
it's just it's a it's a it's a power

617
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:58,400
fantasy that developers have

618
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:59,120
that their free software is this giant

619
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,880
lever

620
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:03,199
that can change the world in ways that

621
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,960
it's just not realistic it's just not

622
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,240
any any way that's going to happen so

623
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:08,799
you should just complicate all the

624
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:10,400
licenses

625
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:12,240
for the sake of this fantasy it doesn't

626
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:14,000
make any sense this is good to back to

627
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:15,520
you drowning out the questions it's

628
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,120
really small

629
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,559
but no i mean so are you suggesting then

630
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:21,039
that it only applies

631
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:21,678
to um software for which you're a small

632
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:23,200
developer that

633
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:24,880
indeed if you had developed a piece of

634
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,400
software that exxon could not simply

635
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,840
rewrite your commits out of

636
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:30,000
that everything that you just said then

637
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:31,840
would not apply i think it would be

638
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,280
really difficult to find

639
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:36,320
a developer with that kind of level of

640
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:38,240
uh

641
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:39,678
level of contribution certainly i don't

642
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:42,000
know of any and

643
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:43,679
and sorry last question how does putting

644
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,410
ethics in licenses make them make your

645
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:48,039
job harder

646
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:48,039
[Applause]

647
00:21:55,200 --> 00:22:01,679
the this one because i need two hands

648
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:03,440
this is molly for the second affirmative

649
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:06,159
seven minutes seven minutes

650
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:07,840
um and those mics don't work if you

651
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:10,159
don't have pockets

652
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,959
uh so i would like to lead off with the

653
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:14,080
statement that

654
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:16,559
james made an argument against licenses

655
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:18,080
in general and i think that's an

656
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:19,840
important thing to address

657
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:23,520
because software freedom in the first

658
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:25,760
place is based on licenses and copyright

659
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:27,520
in order to make those things happen so

660
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,480
i want to kind of lay the basis to begin

661
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:31,679
with that we do need

662
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:32,720
licenses and i think that's a great

663
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:34,559
place to start

664
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:37,039
i'd also like to respond to the comments

665
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:40,240
about the power of developers

666
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:41,120
so for example the hillary for america

667
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:44,240
campaign

668
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:46,000
was using debian for some of their stuff

669
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:47,360
the international space station uses

670
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,120
debian um

671
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:51,120
government organizations use debian and

672
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:54,158
build software off of debian

673
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:56,080
so if it's the case that that actual

674
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:57,200
piece of software is that important it's

675
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:59,199
been in development

676
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:01,039
for a significant number of years

677
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:04,880
creating an easy replacement for it

678
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:06,400
is not so easy um so by a large project

679
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:09,840
making that adoption

680
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:13,360
you're creating like a major use case

681
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:16,559
uh and that's really important um

682
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:20,000
sorry i'm not quite ready

683
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:23,200
oh um uh reaching out to communities

684
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,159
uh to encourage building a commons is

685
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,919
possible so

686
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:27,440
one of the other things is the comment

687
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:29,200
that like

688
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,960
we're going to need to reach out to new

689
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,240
communities to get them involved and it

690
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,159
is possible right

691
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:36,240
so you have people who are currently not

692
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:37,600
developing in this sphere and not

693
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:39,919
participating

694
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,959
because they're concerned about use so

695
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:42,720
suddenly

696
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:44,799
not just talking about definitions of

697
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:46,720
freedom and openness we're building a

698
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:49,279
commons that we weren't capable of

699
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:51,180
building before

700
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:53,279
five minutes left okay um

701
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:56,159
[Music]

702
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:57,039
uh great um in addition to that i would

703
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:59,120
like to

704
00:23:57,039 --> 00:24:00,400
make some comments in support of what

705
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:04,719
john had said

706
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:07,360
um which are noted on my phone

707
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:08,799
somewhere great no that's not it wow

708
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,840
thanks for your patience everyone this

709
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:12,320
is not

710
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:13,039
uh great anyway um let's see what i

711
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:16,559
remember

712
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:20,240
um so from the environmental perspective

713
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:23,279
um i would like to add that we look at

714
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:24,880
software in terms of one of the ways we

715
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:25,600
can look at software and environmental

716
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,080
impact

717
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:29,678
is things like processing speed and

718
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:32,320
server load

719
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:33,919
and making significant changes to make

720
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:35,918
our software more

721
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:37,520
efficient will have positive

722
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:40,880
environmental impact

723
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:43,279
so it's easy to argue that that will be

724
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,400
more effective if you have free and open

725
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:46,720
source software

726
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,679
but in addition to that you're going to

727
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:50,080
be able

728
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:51,039
uh to better reduce that load because

729
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:53,360
you're going to have

730
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:55,039
more people focusing on it since it's a

731
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:58,080
thing that they care about

732
00:24:55,039 --> 00:25:01,200
right um in response to the

733
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:04,879
concept of military and police use

734
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:07,360
um so one of the things that happens

735
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,400
should we reach a point where things

736
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:10,320
like facial

737
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,840
facial recognition technology and

738
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:13,520
different surveillance technologies are

739
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:15,120
under free and open licenses

740
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:17,120
they're going to become better and more

741
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:18,080
effective and this creates an even

742
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:20,320
greater threat

743
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:21,520
from police forces right so if we're

744
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:23,760
able to build into those

745
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,799
forced ethics it's going to make a

746
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,640
bigger difference

747
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:28,480
for these individual communities out

748
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:31,039
there and the people who are already

749
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:32,159
at risk right in terms of labor

750
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:35,200
practices

751
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:38,320
um we see abuse

752
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:40,720
of labor um all over the world uh

753
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:41,760
like and and things that limit labor

754
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:44,080
right so

755
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:46,080
one example i really like is in saudi

756
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:49,439
arabia how there's a culture

757
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:49,760
of women being unable to work especially

758
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:52,080
with

759
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:54,080
like without support from their husbands

760
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:57,039
or their fathers

761
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:58,399
and by creating licenses that ensure

762
00:25:57,039 --> 00:26:00,080
this sort of behavior

763
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:02,480
we're creating an opportunity for them

764
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:03,520
to participate in the creation of these

765
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,679
comments

766
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:07,120
um i'd like to add that one of the

767
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:10,559
things people brought up

768
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:12,320
is the confusion of licenses and the

769
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:14,320
incompatibility of licenses

770
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:15,918
right there's nothing to say that you

771
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,960
have to create licenses that are

772
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:18,640
incompatible

773
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:20,400
and there's nothing to say that you need

774
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:22,559
to have 50 different licenses each

775
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:24,159
addressing a different social issue

776
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:26,158
i would propose the adoption of a

777
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:29,200
creative commons-based model

778
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:32,240
um where there is a base license written

779
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:34,159
off of which people can add things um

780
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:37,039
so that would mean that you can have

781
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:39,600
your no ice claws and you can have

782
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:40,480
your no child labor clause and you can

783
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,559
have your

784
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:44,400
equal like equity and equal

785
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:47,120
participation clause

786
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:48,640
um how much time do i have okay great um

787
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:51,678
you can add those clauses

788
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:53,520
without forcing yourself

789
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:56,080
to deal with incompatibility in the same

790
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:57,600
ways right um and i would go as far to

791
00:26:56,080 --> 00:27:00,320
argue that while ethics

792
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:01,039
change and what society views as ethics

793
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:04,000
change

794
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:06,240
the ethics of individual contributors

795
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,640
might not change as much

796
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:10,159
so they're able to own these decisions

797
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,039
and choose how their software is being

798
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:13,679
used

799
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:15,200
but also how their software uh is

800
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:17,760
affecting the world and having an

801
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,799
impact now i think the like the obvious

802
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:21,760
question to that

803
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:23,679
is like what if somebody creates a like

804
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:25,919
only nazis clause

805
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:26,799
um and i would like to immediately

806
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:29,039
address

807
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:30,240
uh that that sort of problem is

808
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:33,440
something that

809
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:35,120
we can deal with uh managing by things

810
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:38,880
like forking projects

811
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:42,320
by looking karen's frowning at me

812
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:45,200
are you sure okay

813
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:47,279
and making adjustments and building code

814
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:50,399
and all those other wonderful things

815
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:51,919
um so uh in general i think there's a

816
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:55,039
lot of opportunity

817
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:56,000
to reinforce the good uh that licenses

818
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:58,559
can do and

819
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,520
like in another like immediate response

820
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:02,320
um i believe

821
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:03,440
licenses can have teeth and i believe

822
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:05,279
that licensing

823
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,880
is really important not just because it

824
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:08,000
creates an insurance software freedom in

825
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:11,039
the first place

826
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:13,520
but because it has impact even when

827
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:15,600
things like uh employment price like

828
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:18,320
pressure from employees doesn't work

829
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:20,240
like let's look at google google fired

830
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:22,799
people who are doing organizing

831
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:24,000
for their company obviously like

832
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:27,120
companies maintain

833
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:29,840
power right and companies maintain

834
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:31,520
uh control over our access to things we

835
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:34,000
need to survive

836
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:35,520
like health care uh in some countries

837
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,200
sorry i know europe different than the

838
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:40,158
u.s

839
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,880
salaries which uh for which what enable

840
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:44,399
us to

841
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:45,919
buy the things we need so companies will

842
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:48,320
have more power

843
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:51,679
uh companies do have more power when

844
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:51,678
there aren't forced ethics

845
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:01,039
hit me with your best shot okay so now i

846
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:02,159
have cross-examination from the negative

847
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:03,039
side who from the negative side would

848
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:04,720
like to cross

849
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:06,799
no i thought you were going to do it no

850
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:09,440
i'm not i i would like to but i

851
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:10,879
am the moderator oh god okay three

852
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:14,799
minutes please i'm ready

853
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:17,360
all right so you mentioned earlier

854
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:18,320
that debian could change its license and

855
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:22,000
force

856
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:25,439
nasa and everyone else to suddenly adopt

857
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,799
something i'm not sure what but

858
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,399
what are the practical ways that it

859
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:29,840
could do that how many tens of thousands

860
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:32,158
of people would it take to get

861
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:32,879
on board in order to to change debian's

862
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:35,760
licensing

863
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:37,039
well i i think you could run a general

864
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:40,480
resolution

865
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:41,360
uh to manage that i'm not positive i

866
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,880
should know this

867
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:44,559
and in which case you'd only need a

868
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,440
significant percentage of a thousand

869
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:47,440
people

870
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:49,279
to agree to that decision and then you

871
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:52,399
cross off some who won't vote

872
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:54,240
um so i think it's uh possible for

873
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:56,639
debian to make a decision like that

874
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:58,720
so so debian can re-license all the

875
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:00,480
software in debian with

876
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:01,760
with a vote of the debian people i think

877
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,559
you can re-license a certain amount of

878
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:04,240
software

879
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:06,080
these are things i'm not sure about like

880
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:08,559
these are guesses on my behalf

881
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:09,439
um but like the project itself has a lot

882
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:10,720
of power

883
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:12,559
the individuals in it have a lot of

884
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:14,159
power and any member of the project can

885
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:15,678
put forth the general resolution

886
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:17,600
to make a significant change to the

887
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:18,960
community so for example

888
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,879
instead of re-licensing the whole

889
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:22,720
project they could make the decision to

890
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:24,960
pass a general resolution

891
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,919
that will mean all future packages and

892
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:27,440
all future work

893
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:29,360
are required to be under one of these

894
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:32,320
ethical licenses

895
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:32,879
if companies already have decided that

896
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:35,678
they are

897
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:36,480
avoiding things like copyleft how do you

898
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:38,480
how do you go about

899
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:40,240
convincing them to adopt one of these

900
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:43,520
license that have the ethical clause

901
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:45,600
that's a really good question um i think

902
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:47,120
because because companies are afraid of

903
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,000
copyleft and i have lots of stories

904
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,678
about that

905
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,440
um and i'm sure people here have even

906
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:55,200
more um

907
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:56,480
but uh when you're looking especially if

908
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,679
we can look at the foundational

909
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:59,200
technologies

910
00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:01,600
and the things that we're using as the

911
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:04,960
basis on which we're building everything

912
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:07,360
then suddenly it matters a lot more

913
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:08,240
who is putting these requirements onto

914
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:11,519
things

915
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:12,960
um now the

916
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:14,240
well no i won't tell you what question

917
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,720
you should ask me next in response to

918
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,720
that

919
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:18,799
no please go ahead no no it's good it's

920
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:21,760
all you all you

921
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:22,399
so i think my last question really is if

922
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:25,519
you really

923
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:28,158
need communities

924
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:29,919
in order to do this enforcement how does

925
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:31,200
locking yourself into one rigid

926
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:32,799
framework around a license

927
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:35,840
help you when what you really need is

928
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:39,519
that community power in the first place

929
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:42,799
that's a really good question i think

930
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:45,279
one there are social issues

931
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:46,480
that we need to handle at a time scale

932
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:49,760
that's a lot shorter

933
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:51,200
than things that can be um accomplished

934
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:53,600
by having a community

935
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:55,200
make enforcement and make social changes

936
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:56,559
i think we can say with high confidence

937
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,000
that they're terrible people in all

938
00:31:56,559 --> 00:32:00,080
communities

939
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,200
and that social norms aren't being

940
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:02,639
enforced uh

941
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:04,159
to change that so by having something

942
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:06,720
like licenses you are forcing a very

943
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:06,720
sudden change

944
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:14,080
now we have the second negative uh

945
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:15,120
construction that's going to be done by

946
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,879
josh simmons

947
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:19,439
thank you destructive i'm new to this

948
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:19,440
debate stuff

949
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:31,600
okay disclaimer right

950
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:31,600
let's start with that

951
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:40,320
so first i want to say that

952
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:41,200
i think we all share a desire for a more

953
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:43,360
ethical and just

954
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:46,480
world i think that is something that we

955
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:46,479
have broad alignment on

956
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:52,720
however i am here to persuade you

957
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:56,158
further that licenses are not the way to

958
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:57,360
go about this

959
00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:59,600
first i just want to ask the audience a

960
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:00,158
question how many peop here by show of

961
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:02,719
hands

962
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:06,640
think that your code of ethics are

963
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:06,640
universalizable to everybody everywhere

964
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:11,840
bold bold

965
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:16,799
realistically realistically i'm not here

966
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:18,399
to make an argument for moral

967
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:20,480
relativism i think that's a sticky

968
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:21,199
wicket but i do think that ethics are

969
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,880
complicated

970
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:24,880
and that they're highly localized and

971
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,760
that what's right for us here may not be

972
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:29,039
right for

973
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:31,200
people everywhere and

974
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:32,158
even though there are there's much to be

975
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,679
said about their

976
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:35,919
the organizations like the united

977
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:36,640
nations who have definitions of human

978
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:40,559
rights

979
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:43,600
which are reasonably universal

980
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:44,799
i don't know that we can truly trust

981
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,399
these organizations

982
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:47,918
to maintain those definitions in good

983
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:49,279
faith

984
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:50,799
i mean this this is going to be an easy

985
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:52,640
one who thinks the united nations is a

986
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:56,080
good thing

987
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:57,519
yeah right but but how many people feel

988
00:33:56,080 --> 00:34:01,360
good about the efficacy

989
00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:04,799
of the united nations exactly

990
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:06,158
okay so along those lines uh you know i

991
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:07,840
also want to note that the united

992
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:10,000
nations has a has this

993
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:11,440
this way of governing such that you

994
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:14,480
could have a single

995
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:17,280
bad actor a single nation state say

996
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:19,359
no to a proposal to limit a really

997
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:22,000
important expansion of rights

998
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:22,960
thus i don't think that we should hinge

999
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:27,760
ethics

1000
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:29,918
in licenses on on a united nations or

1001
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:31,839
other body similarly there's the

1002
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:34,158
american civil civil liberties union

1003
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:35,918
or the red cross only one of those

1004
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:39,359
really has opinions about ethics

1005
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:40,799
but both of them do valuable

1006
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:44,078
philanthropic work

1007
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:47,200
however neither of them are an

1008
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:48,000
unalloyed good both of those

1009
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:50,000
organizations

1010
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,000
have a history of causing legitimate

1011
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,839
harm as well as all the good that

1012
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,359
they're doing

1013
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:57,279
i don't think that we can outsource our

1014
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:59,440
ethics because there's no institution

1015
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:01,599
that we can rely on to truly capture

1016
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:05,599
this

1017
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:07,440
now do no harm night do

1018
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:09,119
do no harm style licenses ethical

1019
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:11,599
licenses

1020
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:12,800
we we can't capture all of the ethics in

1021
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:14,640
these licenses and so

1022
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:16,720
i think we would need to outsource them

1023
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:17,680
to organizations and to my earlier point

1024
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:19,200
i don't think there's a single

1025
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:21,040
organization that we can really trust to

1026
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:24,319
do that

1027
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:26,480
further i want to say a little bit about

1028
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:28,160
the unenforceability here

1029
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:31,599
you know there's even people who are

1030
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:34,078
proponents of ethical licenses

1031
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:35,839
concede that these things would be very

1032
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:38,480
very difficult to enforce

1033
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:40,560
can you really legislate these in a

1034
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:43,680
court of law

1035
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:44,799
tbd we really don't know but even if you

1036
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:47,118
could

1037
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:48,960
who would the amount of enforcement

1038
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:52,640
action that's happening today

1039
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:54,160
is practically nil and so using licenses

1040
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:57,118
as a vehicle that just seems like an

1041
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:57,118
ineffective strategy

1042
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:00,240
and then there's the issue of vagueness

1043
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:03,839
you know some

1044
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:05,520
licenses are well crafted most of them

1045
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:07,279
not so much and a lot of these things

1046
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:09,680
leave a lot of room for

1047
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:11,119
uh leave a lot of room for

1048
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:14,160
interpretation

1049
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:15,280
and as far as i understand it

1050
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:17,839
judges don't like it when people are

1051
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:19,520
trying to be clever and if something is

1052
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:20,720
vague and arguable well you're not going

1053
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:23,359
to be able to make a convincing case in

1054
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,359
the first place

1055
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:28,240
i also want to note that there is more

1056
00:36:25,839 --> 00:36:30,240
than one ethical framework

1057
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:31,759
the most well-trained ethicists

1058
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:33,839
understand that for any

1059
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:35,599
sticky problem we need to bring multiple

1060
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:37,200
ethical frameworks to bear on that issue

1061
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:37,680
in order to really see our way through

1062
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:40,399
it

1063
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:42,399
such that in most cases we need to

1064
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:44,880
approach ethical ethical decisions

1065
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:47,119
on a case-by-case basis it's really not

1066
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:49,200
universalizable

1067
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:51,280
we cannot capture this complexity and a

1068
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:52,720
license

1069
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:54,400
and i want to speak to some of the harms

1070
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:56,399
that people have have noted potential

1071
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:57,920
harms

1072
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:59,680
one of the reasons that we have the four

1073
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:02,640
freedoms and the open source definition

1074
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:05,279
and we have these organizations that

1075
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:07,520
steward licenses generally is to limit

1076
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:09,280
license proliferation

1077
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:11,520
we limit license proliferations that we

1078
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:14,079
can encourage adoption of a standard

1079
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:17,599
that gives us a give us gives us a solid

1080
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:19,119
baseline from which we can build on

1081
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:21,119
to the point about incompat about

1082
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:23,200
compatibility

1083
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:25,280
it may be that we can design a license

1084
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:26,720
that provides a solid foundation and we

1085
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:29,680
can have these additional

1086
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:31,759
uh layers on top of it for you know no

1087
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:36,078
ice or no child labor or

1088
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:37,680
uh nine to six but if we do that

1089
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:40,720
do the components with those different

1090
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:42,078
licenses are those interoperable

1091
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:43,359
i think that's an open question and i

1092
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:46,640
think that's one that we need to answer

1093
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:46,640
before we experiment here

1094
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:50,000
i also want to note that i i think that

1095
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:52,160
this has the potential to drive

1096
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,040
down adoption of open source and free

1097
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,480
free software

1098
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:55,920
and limit the very real good that's

1099
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:57,359
already happening through things like

1100
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:58,720
humanitarian free and open source

1101
00:37:57,359 --> 00:38:00,400
software

1102
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:02,480
we've got sahana and usahidi for

1103
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:03,599
disaster response my myfast initiative

1104
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:05,119
for the unbanked

1105
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:07,119
libre health for health systems in the

1106
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:09,200
developing world water project and open

1107
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:11,599
air quality for detecting pollution

1108
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:13,439
we have projects that are making a

1109
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:14,480
difference in all of these spaces that

1110
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:17,359
people are

1111
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:18,720
raising rightly raising concerns about

1112
00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:22,160
the projects that are addressing them

1113
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:22,160
using the existing frameworks

1114
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:29,118
i think that licenses are an ineffective

1115
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:31,760
vehicle

1116
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:34,960
and a vehicle that could cause

1117
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:34,960
unintended consequences

1118
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:40,240
i think the other proposals the other

1119
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:41,359
options that we have on the table

1120
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:43,839
are the ones that we should really be

1121
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:44,799
pursuing now i'm all for an all of the

1122
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:49,040
above approach

1123
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:50,720
we are faced with extraordinarily

1124
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:52,960
massive challenges at this time in our

1125
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:54,240
in our existence we should try all of

1126
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:55,760
the things let's throw the spaghetti at

1127
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:57,759
the wall and figure it out

1128
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:59,359
but i'm of the opinion that even though

1129
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:01,760
we may try with licenses

1130
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:02,400
that is not the right vehicle codes of

1131
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:05,440
conduct

1132
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:07,040
refusing to support accept issues pull

1133
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:08,720
requests from bad actors

1134
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:10,560
refusing to grant use of the project

1135
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:12,720
trademark how

1136
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:14,000
seeking regulation from governments

1137
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:15,919
doing labor organizing so

1138
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,839
that we can say no when we're asked to

1139
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:20,160
do something that we know is wrong

1140
00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:20,160
thank you

1141
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:25,920
we're going to have cross-examination

1142
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:28,400
from the affirmative who from the

1143
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:29,280
the side's going to do it dash all

1144
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:32,720
righty

1145
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:36,000
um okay so uh first off

1146
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:37,680
um so if if the point

1147
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,520
if we shouldn't be enforcing licenses at

1148
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:40,879
all what what are we doing here

1149
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:44,000
i mean specifically in this room in the

1150
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:45,359
legal and policy room at fosdem

1151
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,200
i didn't say we shouldn't be enforcing

1152
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:48,240
licenses i think we should have more

1153
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:50,560
enforcement frankly

1154
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:52,399
okay what does it matter if ethics are

1155
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:54,000
localized because aren't licenses

1156
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:55,520
personal to the author shouldn't it only

1157
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:58,000
be a question of whether

1158
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:59,520
the ethics embodied by the license are

1159
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,880
those that the author releasing their

1160
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:02,320
work under that license would want them

1161
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:03,839
to be

1162
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:05,280
you know i think every author has a

1163
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:06,160
prerogative to license things the way

1164
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,599
they see fit

1165
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:09,598
and i think that's that's right and

1166
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:12,400
proper however

1167
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:13,839
the whole point of ethical licenses as i

1168
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:16,720
understand it

1169
00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:17,680
is to move the needle in the world at

1170
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:20,560
large

1171
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:22,560
and so if it's only uh addressing the

1172
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:24,480
concerns of that author but limiting

1173
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:26,319
the possibility for their their software

1174
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:27,359
to be adopted by other people

1175
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:29,440
then they're cutting off their nose

1176
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:30,880
despite their face i'm curious as to

1177
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:32,000
what you think as to why that would be

1178
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:33,200
limiting but i've got some other

1179
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:36,000
questions so i'll proceed

1180
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:38,480
you mentioned the un can the u.n sue you

1181
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:40,480
for something unethical you did

1182
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:41,599
i have no idea i don't think so i

1183
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,720
believe the answer is no i didn't

1184
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:43,119
research that but i believe the answer

1185
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:45,839
is no

1186
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:47,599
whereas if a license or had licensed

1187
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:49,119
software to you on ethical terms and you

1188
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:51,440
had breached those would the license or

1189
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:53,520
be able to sue you for that

1190
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:55,760
i believe so presumably yes so it seems

1191
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:57,520
that licenses with ethical licenses then

1192
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:58,160
offer a lever that are larger than

1193
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:00,480
perhaps

1194
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:01,680
these other community pressures and you

1195
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:03,359
know organizations

1196
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:05,440
i will note that though the u.n may not

1197
00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:07,279
be able to sue me the u.n does have

1198
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:08,800
uh does have mechanisms for exerting

1199
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:10,640
pressure and

1200
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:12,800
so would you concede then that a bad

1201
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:16,480
actor can be pressured by

1202
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:17,680
positive actors to change their behavior

1203
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:20,000
yes and that's why i made many

1204
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:22,720
alternative proposals okay

1205
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,520
and if someone was to kill me for

1206
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:27,520
instance

1207
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:29,680
they could be tried for murder correct

1208
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:31,839
yes so if they could be tried for murder

1209
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:34,000
why would there also be a framework for

1210
00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:35,200
my family to bring a wrongful death suit

1211
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,960
it seems that you're arguing that if

1212
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:38,720
there's an existing framework for

1213
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:42,319
addressing a problem that

1214
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:42,319
redundant frameworks aren't necessary

1215
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:46,400
i think that grossly mischaracterizes my

1216
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:49,760
argument

1217
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:50,319
okay i'll take that um what would you

1218
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,760
like to

1219
00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:53,359
would you like to reinstate what you

1220
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:54,800
meant then by saying that there are

1221
00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:57,040
better mechanisms than licenses why

1222
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:59,440
can't licenses also exist as a mechanism

1223
00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:00,560
to reinforce what already exists to

1224
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:02,800
police ethics

1225
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:05,200
because they are friction they are rigid

1226
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:07,119
they are difficult to change

1227
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:08,879
because there are better mechanisms that

1228
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:12,000
we could uh have

1229
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:14,240
disproportionate impact with

1230
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:17,280
and so you mentioned that licenses are

1231
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:18,399
ineffective how are they ineffective

1232
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:20,560
well let's look at the level of

1233
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:23,680
enforcement action

1234
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:26,000
okay and then i guess finally sorry

1235
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:27,200
i'm trying to struggling with this um

1236
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:30,720
i've got to admire this

1237
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:33,200
so why why why does it that ethics have

1238
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:33,200
to be vague

1239
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:38,560
so uh both teams have agreed to do only

1240
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:40,160
one rebuttal so we can get the question

1241
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:42,480
so we'll have the first uh negative

1242
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:45,040
rebuttal i think is it right yeah

1243
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:45,040
so who let's

1244
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:58,079
i think what this comes down to for us

1245
00:42:56,839 --> 00:43:02,560
really

1246
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:05,119
is that the effort you put in

1247
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:05,759
to putting all the stuff in licenses

1248
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:08,240
might

1249
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:09,920
theoretically if a whole bunch of

1250
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:12,879
improbable things happen

1251
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:13,839
eventually result in somebody somewhere

1252
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:16,240
being pressured

1253
00:43:13,839 --> 00:43:17,599
to act for the public good and the list

1254
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:20,078
of things you would have to do

1255
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:20,640
that would have to go right is just kind

1256
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:23,040
of

1257
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:24,799
amazingly long and impractical right

1258
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:26,400
you'd have to convince communities

1259
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:28,000
to adopt it and maybe you could do that

1260
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:30,000
that actually seems like there are

1261
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,319
definitely some communities that will do

1262
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,839
it

1263
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:33,200
i mean there's there's certainly some

1264
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:35,119
free software communities that want to

1265
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:37,040
consign themselves to a relevancy

1266
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:39,280
in one fell swoop i believe that that is

1267
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:39,279
true

1268
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:46,480
then you would have to get knowledge

1269
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:49,598
of a violation understand it well enough

1270
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:51,599
begin some sort of process to address it

1271
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:53,200
have that process fail begin some sort

1272
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:56,240
of enforcement process

1273
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:57,439
have these clauses even recognized

1274
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:59,598
anywhere in the world as

1275
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:00,800
valid and enforced and reach a point

1276
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:01,920
litigate something all the way to a

1277
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:04,160
conclusion

1278
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:05,839
and then try to enforce a judgment

1279
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:07,359
that's a lot of steps

1280
00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:09,279
really improbable steps i don't know

1281
00:44:07,359 --> 00:44:11,839
many free software projects that have

1282
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:13,760
that many steps it's not a cost-free

1283
00:44:11,839 --> 00:44:15,680
process to get there right the notion

1284
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:18,640
that we will get benefit out of this

1285
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:20,240
is all very theoretical very attenuated

1286
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:21,920
and you end up with a rather small

1287
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:23,759
effect out the other end in isolated

1288
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:25,680
instances

1289
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:27,119
but you pay a big cost for that right

1290
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:29,279
every license

1291
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:31,200
bifurcation that splits a community into

1292
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:33,520
two where we've got the same piece of

1293
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:34,078
software being written 20 times for 20

1294
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:36,160
different

1295
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:37,440
ethical license offshoots and none of

1296
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:37,920
them are compatible with each other

1297
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:40,160
because

1298
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:41,680
the climate license says your stuff has

1299
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:43,200
to be climate compatible and the labor

1300
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:43,919
license says your stuff has to be labor

1301
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:45,759
compatible

1302
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:47,839
and those two can't cooperate with each

1303
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:48,880
other right the cost of splitting these

1304
00:44:47,839 --> 00:44:51,440
communities

1305
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:53,359
is very high the only reason free

1306
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:55,200
software works so well why it's on the

1307
00:44:53,359 --> 00:44:57,119
ascendancy and the way it is

1308
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:59,118
is because we've created this massive

1309
00:44:57,119 --> 00:45:01,040
pool of common value that is worth

1310
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:02,480
accessing if you split those into

1311
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:04,000
smaller pools

1312
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:05,599
they become tiny puddles that we can

1313
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,760
just hop over

1314
00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:09,680
that's not going to work at the end of

1315
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:12,079
the day if you want

1316
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:12,960
ethics if you want ethical use of

1317
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:15,359
technology

1318
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:17,040
you have to do it without the shortcuts

1319
00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:19,040
you have to do the organizing

1320
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:21,359
you have to do the community building

1321
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:23,440
there are no cheat codes here

1322
00:45:21,359 --> 00:45:24,880
so if you want ethics go back to your

1323
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:26,640
communities and talk to them about

1324
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:28,480
what your community is worth and why it

1325
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:29,759
is worth being in that community

1326
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:32,800
that is how we're going to win this

1327
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:33,960
battle not by writing a bunch of rules

1328
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:39,440
thank you

1329
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:41,200
[Applause]

1330
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:43,040
so we have the final affirmative

1331
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:45,040
rebuttal

1332
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:46,640
because we you agreed that we do we

1333
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:47,279
forego the last rebuttal for audience

1334
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:50,078
remember

1335
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:50,079
you agree to the beginning

1336
00:45:52,430 --> 00:45:57,129
[Laughter]

1337
00:45:57,359 --> 00:46:04,319
i apologize if you didn't agree okay

1338
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:04,319
feel free to jump in okay go ahead

1339
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:09,040
am i unmuted now yes okay

1340
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:12,480
okay well so the world's gonna end we

1341
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:13,839
know that uh

1342
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:15,599
we really need to try to do something

1343
00:46:13,839 --> 00:46:19,200
about this um i understand

1344
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:21,040
and i feel uh it's the concerns for free

1345
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:22,480
software as a model are serious if we

1346
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:23,200
start thinking about adding new things

1347
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:24,640
to it but

1348
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:26,960
um i also think the free software has

1349
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:28,799
succeeded because because it's an

1350
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:29,680
ethical foundation and that's why people

1351
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:31,040
who have

1352
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:32,399
uh when they achieve other social goals

1353
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:34,160
are turning to our free software

1354
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:35,280
licenses to modify them to try to

1355
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:36,720
achieve different goals it's that

1356
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:37,520
ethical foundation that's bringing

1357
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:39,759
people

1358
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:42,240
to it you know it's it's github that

1359
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:46,720
made collaboration tangibly easy

1360
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:46,720
not the four freedoms the four freedoms

1361
00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:50,800
the four freedoms are the ethical

1362
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:52,480
foundation and that's why people are

1363
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:55,280
interested in what we're doing

1364
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:57,040
now will these licenses be enforced uh

1365
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:58,560
maybe maybe not but i think they will be

1366
00:46:57,040 --> 00:47:00,800
more likely to be enforced than

1367
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:02,480
uh than copyleft licenses for example

1368
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:04,160
because they're embodying

1369
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:05,920
uh things that are very tangible and

1370
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:07,040
immediate harms that people feel very

1371
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:08,400
strongly about

1372
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:10,240
but as we know even if they're not

1373
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:11,839
enforced they still serve a a

1374
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:13,359
strong function i think the argument

1375
00:47:11,839 --> 00:47:14,078
about community norms is actually an

1376
00:47:13,359 --> 00:47:16,720
argument for

1377
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:18,880
having ethical for having social goals

1378
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:20,078
addressed in license drafting

1379
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:22,559
because that enables different

1380
00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:24,000
communities to more concretely define

1381
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:26,000
the ethical reasons and the social

1382
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:27,920
reasons that they're working together

1383
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,280
would we have incompatibilities

1384
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:30,640
maybe but remember that people can

1385
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:32,079
release their work under more than one

1386
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:33,598
license at the same time and make them

1387
00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:34,640
available for all of the causes that

1388
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:36,800
they care about

1389
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:38,000
we also still have the option of having

1390
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:39,760
an omnibus license

1391
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,599
and a body that vets you know different

1392
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:42,640
parts what can be added to that

1393
00:47:41,599 --> 00:47:44,240
and really what's the cost of

1394
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:45,759
incompatibility anyway it just means

1395
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:47,598
that someone has to write code

1396
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:49,200
that really they shouldn't have to write

1397
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:50,640
because it's already out there well

1398
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:55,200
that's not as big of a deal as global

1399
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:57,920
warming so i think we can stomach it

1400
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:59,359
um you know and i'm also a little bit

1401
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:00,319
confused because free software is an

1402
00:47:59,359 --> 00:48:01,200
ethical value

1403
00:48:00,319 --> 00:48:03,279
these things that we're talking about

1404
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:04,640
are ethical values so kind of every

1405
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:07,520
argument against

1406
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:08,960
the rigidity of an ethical value or the

1407
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:10,720
you know ability to come to agreement on

1408
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:12,079
these things to me is an argument also

1409
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:13,520
against free software in general you

1410
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:14,960
know how are we able to agree on any

1411
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:16,640
ethical value why is it

1412
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:18,400
free software alone that gets to be the

1413
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:21,680
rigid ethical value

1414
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:25,119
but not opposing labor exploitation

1415
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:26,960
uh and i think that uh

1416
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:28,880
you know we have laws that are very

1417
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:30,400
complicated to enforce

1418
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:31,920
but they still get enforced and they

1419
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:32,319
still serve a deterrent effect even

1420
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:33,839
though

1421
00:48:32,319 --> 00:48:35,440
you can also list all the steps that you

1422
00:48:33,839 --> 00:48:37,359
have to go through for a police you know

1423
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:40,160
a police officer to catch somebody

1424
00:48:37,359 --> 00:48:41,920
doing something prove it in court not

1425
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:43,520
make any mistakes along the way

1426
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:45,040
not have any appeals succeed like

1427
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:45,680
enforcing any laws a really difficult

1428
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:47,200
thing

1429
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:49,118
we think we can do that with licenses as

1430
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:49,839
well fundamentally we think we need to

1431
00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:51,520
try

1432
00:48:49,839 --> 00:48:53,680
and specifically we should try in the

1433
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:55,200
drafting stage see what happens we know

1434
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:55,759
a lot of people want these licenses so

1435
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:57,200
adoption

1436
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:58,559
really isn't a concern people have

1437
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:00,480
already asked them for them and they're

1438
00:48:58,559 --> 00:49:03,839
already doing them

1439
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:03,839
thank you

1440
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:10,558
so i want to thank both the teams again

1441
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:12,640
for for going their final rebuttals to

1442
00:49:10,559 --> 00:49:14,400
have uh to have audience questions

1443
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:16,000
i'm going to ask them that more than any

1444
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:18,640
other debate we've had today this slide

1445
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,440
obviously applies um but i'm going to

1446
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:21,040
ask

1447
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:22,319
everyone to stay in character for the

1448
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:24,319
audience questions if you don't mind

1449
00:49:22,319 --> 00:49:25,440
because i think it'll be more fun

1450
00:49:24,319 --> 00:49:31,839
fontana's going to bring around that's

1451
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:31,839
mike for questions i think

1452
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:50,720
hello hi hi here so

1453
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:52,720
this is the first time i'm asking a

1454
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:56,839
question like that so

1455
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:58,000
uh psychedepoint was mentioned earlier

1456
00:49:56,839 --> 00:50:00,720
that

1457
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,520
having a policy like say this software

1458
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:05,040
has to be

1459
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:07,040
green or try to improve reduce the

1460
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:09,920
the impact the environmental impact of

1461
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:14,000
the process making things faster

1462
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:16,000
a friend of mine his working in uh

1463
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:17,599
in construction road construction they

1464
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:20,480
say that

1465
00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:22,160
if you build more roads there will be

1466
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:25,119
more traffic

1467
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:27,200
so if you make a software faster it will

1468
00:50:25,119 --> 00:50:29,520
be used more and more

1469
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:32,078
it's really a very temporary at least

1470
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:34,000
based on that idea very temporary

1471
00:50:32,079 --> 00:50:35,440
the opinion is that it's temporary if

1472
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:38,640
you make something faster

1473
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:41,680
if you claim that this software

1474
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:42,640
is used to make things faster or to

1475
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:44,960
improve the

1476
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:46,799
to reduce the let's say the

1477
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:49,520
environmental impact

1478
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:51,440
we are just it's a very temporary fix

1479
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:53,440
i'm sorry do you have a question

1480
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:54,640
that's what i'm saying it's a temporary

1481
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:58,319
fix we are

1482
00:50:54,640 --> 00:51:01,200
by playing uh

1483
00:50:58,319 --> 00:51:02,720
but is this a question so the opinion if

1484
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:05,118
it's just a comment i'm sorry

1485
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:06,000
we can respond to it and then move on do

1486
00:51:05,119 --> 00:51:07,359
you want to respond

1487
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,559
yeah sure i mean i think i think the

1488
00:51:07,359 --> 00:51:10,480
point one of the points that i think

1489
00:51:08,559 --> 00:51:12,240
that you raised is that when we create

1490
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:13,839
tools those tools can also

1491
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:15,520
enable the various behaviors that we

1492
00:51:13,839 --> 00:51:16,799
don't want to see happen you build roads

1493
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:18,720
and you're letting traffic happen and i

1494
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:20,640
think that software is a great

1495
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:22,399
um allegory for that you build software

1496
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:24,240
and then people use it to police their

1497
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:25,520
societies to drill oil to do all these

1498
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:27,279
things but that

1499
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:29,040
that because of that that's all the more

1500
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:31,599
reason why it's incumbent upon us

1501
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:33,040
to build these ethical guard rails in

1502
00:51:31,599 --> 00:51:34,720
place so that people can develop

1503
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:36,160
software knowing and confidence

1504
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:37,839
that as long as they enforce their

1505
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:39,680
rights in it that it won't be

1506
00:51:37,839 --> 00:51:41,359
applied towards these you know means

1507
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:43,520
that you don't want to see happen

1508
00:51:41,359 --> 00:51:45,119
um i would like to add to that that

1509
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:46,480
let's say you're building a fundamental

1510
00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:47,599
piece of software like an operating

1511
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:48,240
system and you're making it more

1512
00:51:47,599 --> 00:51:49,920
efficient

1513
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:51,598
it's way better for people to adopt the

1514
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:52,960
more efficient operating system

1515
00:51:51,599 --> 00:51:56,559
than it is to use something that's heavy

1516
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:56,559
clunky and uses a lot of resources

1517
00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:06,079
thank you great panel i have a question

1518
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:08,640
do you understand software freedom as

1519
00:52:06,079 --> 00:52:10,640
the freedom of the user to choose

1520
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:12,640
how to use the software or is the

1521
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:19,839
freedom of the developer to restrict how

1522
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:19,839
the user uses the software

1523
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:38,240
in that the developer has the ability

1524
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:42,480
to define the purpose that they are

1525
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:44,640
making their work for and the user has

1526
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:46,000
certain rights as well but you know we

1527
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:48,480
have examples all over society

1528
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:49,680
of rules about um users not being you

1529
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:51,200
know there are limits when as soon as

1530
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:52,480
your use of something causes harm to

1531
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:53,439
another person that use can be

1532
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:54,960
restricted

1533
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:56,960
likewise if that heart that uses a

1534
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:58,400
public health risk it can be restricted

1535
00:52:56,960 --> 00:53:00,559
and that's where i think the ability

1536
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:02,160
that's where i think the ability

1537
00:53:00,559 --> 00:53:06,160
of developers to have some more control

1538
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:06,160
comes in and distributors

1539
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:09,839
no no no no

1540
00:53:12,079 --> 00:53:16,079
um i'd like to open up if there are any

1541
00:53:13,839 --> 00:53:16,078
women

1542
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:23,520
uh i

1543
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:27,280
i agree uh

1544
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:28,640
it's i don't i don't think that means

1545
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:30,880
i'm conceited conceding

1546
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:33,279
uh to the resolution but i agree with

1547
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:36,319
their response to that

1548
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:38,800
uh i'd like to really quickly just

1549
00:53:36,319 --> 00:53:40,240
uh ask if there are any women or

1550
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:42,319
non-binary folks in the room who would

1551
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:43,200
like to ask a question so do you want to

1552
00:53:42,319 --> 00:53:44,319
respond

1553
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:46,160
yeah yeah sure while we're waiting for

1554
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:47,599
more hands i would just uh to to follow

1555
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:49,040
up on the response to marco's question i

1556
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:50,640
think that it is definitively if we look

1557
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:52,558
to the four freedoms the freedom of the

1558
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:54,879
user receiving the software and that

1559
00:53:52,559 --> 00:53:56,480
is what free software depends on but i

1560
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:58,000
think going back to everything that

1561
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:58,800
lewis so eloquently addressed in the

1562
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,800
previous talk

1563
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:02,160
that sometimes you have to decide where

1564
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:04,480
these freedoms need to cave

1565
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:06,480
in order to accomplish other goals that

1566
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:08,000
are just as if not even more pressing

1567
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:09,760
and important and i think that

1568
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:11,520
that's what the core of this discussion

1569
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:13,040
is

1570
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:15,280
very quick addendum we're advocating

1571
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:18,240
putting uh the the items in the license

1572
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:18,240
not in the four freedoms

1573
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:25,200
um yeah well hi um so

1574
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:27,440
first the disclaimer is also for me and

1575
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:28,319
my question is for the affirmative team

1576
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:31,599
over the last

1577
00:54:28,319 --> 00:54:32,558
decade or so pretty much all big open

1578
00:54:31,599 --> 00:54:34,319
source projects

1579
00:54:32,559 --> 00:54:36,400
in addition to having an open source

1580
00:54:34,319 --> 00:54:38,319
license have in code of conduct

1581
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:39,680
and everything that depends on

1582
00:54:38,319 --> 00:54:41,839
governance and

1583
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:43,440
ethics and describing what is right and

1584
00:54:41,839 --> 00:54:45,279
what is wrong in the community

1585
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:47,040
is defined in the code of conduct and

1586
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:50,160
how to handle that

1587
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:52,000
so my question is if it's easy to do all

1588
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:53,920
that in the license

1589
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:57,520
why do we have code of conduct and where

1590
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:57,520
are we all wrong in the last 10 years

1591
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:02,879
that's a very good question that i feel

1592
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:05,279
like i'm the one who's supposed to

1593
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:08,480
respond to it

1594
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:11,520
i would make a few quick points

1595
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:12,559
um which are perhaps that is a place

1596
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:15,759
where we need to

1597
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:19,040
be looking at including in licensing

1598
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:22,000
um codes of conduct uh govern

1599
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:23,200
the behavior of individuals uh and how

1600
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:26,000
they're interacting

1601
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:27,520
um and also tie into a lot of their like

1602
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:31,440
fundamental rights

1603
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:34,000
um so challenging that with a license i

1604
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:37,119
think is a much harder question

1605
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:39,680
like how do we look at what this means

1606
00:55:37,119 --> 00:55:41,760
in a legal context especially as the

1607
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:42,720
legal context varies so much country to

1608
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:46,640
country

1609
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:49,759
um i would also kind of add to that that

1610
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:52,879
codes of conduct are like not

1611
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:53,599
always effective so i want to i want to

1612
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:55,760
thank these

1613
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:56,640
uh debaters here of of all the debates i

1614
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:58,720
think this is the

1615
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:59,920
where the people most had to take

1616
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:00,558
positions they don't necessarily agree

1617
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:02,119
with

1618
00:56:00,559 --> 00:56:04,000
and i thank them for doing that for the

1619
00:56:02,119 --> 00:56:07,119
pedagogical purposes

1620
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:07,119
of this debate thank you

1621
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:13,200
and so so uh we're doing questions

1622
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:14,480
uh brief questions of the whole audience

1623
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:15,040
after each debate since we're not doing

1624
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:16,799
winners

1625
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:18,400
uh by raise of hands how many people

1626
00:56:16,799 --> 00:56:19,680
learned something about these issues

1627
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:22,400
in this debate they didn't know about

1628
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:25,040
before they came in

1629
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:26,319
and how many people's minds were on one

1630
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:28,720
side of the issue and now are on the

1631
00:56:26,319 --> 00:56:32,400
other after this debate

1632
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:34,319
only one three three okay

1633
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:35,359
but many but it looks like a lot of

1634
00:56:34,319 --> 00:56:36,880
people learned something and we're

1635
00:56:35,359 --> 00:56:39,279
really glad that you did

1636
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:42,400
uh if the debaters for the next uh

1637
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:42,400
debate could come down here

1638
00:56:42,839 --> 00:56:45,839
please
