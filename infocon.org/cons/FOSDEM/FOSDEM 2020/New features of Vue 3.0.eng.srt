1
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:09,120
so i just want to start off view three

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,080
love it i love you three i've been doing

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,678
uh

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,040
well actually view three but just view

5
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:13,519
overall i've been doing the last three

6
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,959
years

7
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:16,160
and it's really really good framework

8
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,279
that i've been using i really want to

9
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,039
talk more about it

10
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:20,400
and let you guys know about view three

11
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:22,800
coming up

12
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,479
there one thing i like about view three

13
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,880
is it's really easy to pick up

14
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,760
i bring in some grads into the company

15
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,240
sometimes

16
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,679
and i have they have a very easy time

17
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,600
kind of picking it up again they don't

18
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:36,079
have javascript experience

19
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,079
but they're able to kind of pick up um

20
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:41,200
based on the structure of you

21
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:44,559
um how it kind of works

22
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:46,800
um ujs has been kind of around

23
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:49,440
the last uh six years so it's like uh

24
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:52,078
2013 was the first version like uh

25
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,960
0.6 and it's been going since then and

26
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:56,320
view 3

27
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:58,480
is supposed to be released this quarter

28
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,680
but it's been held back at the moment uh

29
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:03,440
there

30
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:04,159
so state of view just to give you an

31
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,438
update on it

32
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:07,200
i was hoping by this talk when i

33
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:08,559
submitted this talk that

34
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,799
vue was three was supposed to be

35
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,159
released in the end of uh 2019

36
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,520
so i thought by the time this came

37
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:14,080
around i would have all everything done

38
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,479
for you

39
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,119
and showing you all the new features and

40
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:19,920
there

41
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:20,960
and like pro code examples of it so

42
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,600
unfortunately it's still an

43
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,798
alpha stage at the moment now i have a

44
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,039
kind of

45
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:28,960
i guess that there's view amsterdam in

46
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,000
three weeks they might release there i

47
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,000
don't know for certain

48
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,520
but it's something that i think is there

49
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,320
so it's still an alpha release

50
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,720
and planned for q1 they said when they

51
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,158
upd

52
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,880
when they kind of missed it they kind of

53
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:44,240
said q1 so and then most of the rfcs are

54
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,240
closed for comments at the moment

55
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:48,799
so um

56
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,640
as well with the with it not being

57
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,240
finished the only kind of

58
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,840
version of it that's available at the

59
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,240
moment is the kind of like the cdn

60
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,680
version so we import it into your html

61
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,759
and then you can kind of use the kind of

62
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,840
javascript there what we normally do

63
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:05,840
when we're programming in my company

64
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,119
is we use the kind of compiler the

65
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,800
vue.js compiler

66
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:10,318
so we have our dot view files and then

67
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,360
we compile it that's not ready because

68
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:13,040
the view loader

69
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,400
that understands that schema of that

70
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,239
file is not ready

71
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,599
so again the examples you see in the

72
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:19,760
view repository

73
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:23,599
is just uh ones from when they import

74
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:25,040
the kind of the cdn link

75
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:28,000
so it wouldn't be a thing without

76
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:29,599
showing like how popular view is

77
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,599
again it's not the most popular but i

78
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:33,679
think it's kind of gaining traction

79
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:34,720
um how you kind of measure popularity

80
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,720
and kind of

81
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,400
frameworks is kind of like up to

82
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,040
yourselves but i kind of picked it by

83
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,680
like

84
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,480
npm downloads so as you can see up here

85
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,360
is the green one

86
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,480
is that we react obviously the most

87
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:50,160
popular one

88
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:52,560
but then you see down here is um

89
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,599
view so reviews kind of come behind

90
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,080
behind react

91
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:56,879
and then you have like angular amber

92
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,360
source

93
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:00,799
and backbone so i think views kind of

94
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,720
get more and more popular

95
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,800
again i think it's the ease of use of it

96
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,720
again graduates can kind of pick it up

97
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,400
senior maybe infrastructure people that

98
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,840
never did javascript before i've seen

99
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,360
pick it up very quickly like

100
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,200
so i thought that's what i kind of like

101
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,280
about it

102
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,640
um these are the kind of new features

103
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,680
there's more than this that they've

104
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,920
introduced and these are the ones i'm

105
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:23,200
going to kind of go over

106
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:25,040
there um

107
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,560
so one thing about the these kind of

108
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,319
features and stuff you don't see

109
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,920
is it's a smaller code base now so

110
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:31,440
they've released

111
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,119
the way they've kind of done it is they

112
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,720
made it about 10 kilobytes now so it

113
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,080
used to be around 20 kilobytes the core

114
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,959
and they've kind of like

115
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:40,560
brought it down a bit there um there's

116
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:41,599
better typescript support which i won't

117
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,560
go over here

118
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:46,560
as well other features there there is

119
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:50,239
kind of like time slice and support

120
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,840
static tree uh host hosting and

121
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:54,560
you know optimized slot generation so

122
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,840
those are those other kind of um

123
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:59,120
features but we'll kind of go through

124
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:02,239
these ones here to kind of show you

125
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,799
hardcore the core what i found through

126
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:04,080
like

127
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:06,799
investigating this and going through the

128
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,879
rfcs is really what they've kind of done

129
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:10,799
is they've brought in some plug-ins into

130
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:12,239
the core of ujs

131
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:13,920
so that's the ones i'm going to go over

132
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:15,280
and then some of them they've just they

133
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,519
were never plug-ins before

134
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,798
and they've added them as new features

135
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,320
so you can think of it

136
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:22,159
some of the features that are in view

137
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,120
three you can actually do in view two at

138
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,560
the moment

139
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,880
and then when view three comes out it

140
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:29,600
should be like an easy upgrade

141
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,400
so i never say easy well you never say

142
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,840
easy because there's always going to be

143
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,239
some kind of problem but it should be

144
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,520
like

145
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,800
easy enough to do like so

146
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,440
that's i'll show you some of those as

147
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:41,040
well so just for

148
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,639
anybody actually one thing i forgot to

149
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,000
do how many vgs

150
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:46,400
developers are here i just kind of want

151
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,400
to know

152
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:51,360
say 50 60 60 okay that's good okay

153
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:54,000
lisa's getting more popular i've got to

154
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:56,160
ask that in the popularity a bit there

155
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,440
so just for the the guys that are not

156
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,199
vue.js developers

157
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,880
this what i love about it is the

158
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:02,000
structure of it so this is a single file

159
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,600
component

160
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,600
and you've got three sections for a

161
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,320
template which all the html goes to the

162
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,919
script

163
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,840
where all your kind of javascript goes

164
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:11,280
and your styling again when i show the

165
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:13,119
grads or maybe the senior

166
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,638
infrastructure team how to kind of

167
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,479
develop that's what i show them and they

168
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:19,120
can understand it pretty quick

169
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:19,840
do you know so this is a very basic one

170
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,080
of this

171
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:23,119
and here you have in your data section

172
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,280
your reactivity

173
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,560
so you have a thing called greeting and

174
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,239
the greeting will appear there and

175
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,080
that's your one web component

176
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,440
again it's very very simple for them to

177
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,440
understand

178
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,800
so this is like what i was talking about

179
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:37,440
earlier a compile time

180
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,240
file so vue.js has to use webpack to

181
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,479
convert it

182
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,160
into html and javascript files then

183
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:43,680
afterwards so this is not what's going

184
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,639
to appear on your kind of

185
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:48,560
application it's going to compile it for

186
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:50,560
you and this is not what's ready in

187
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,080
vue.js3 at the moment to take in the new

188
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,320
features that it's done

189
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,320
so

190
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,840
okay so one of the big ones that they're

191
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,280
one of the big features that came in and

192
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,479
there's a lot of controversy over it i

193
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,840
think people kind of got the wrong of

194
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:06,159
the stick straight away

195
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,520
is do you know the way there was the

196
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:10,000
optional api

197
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,919
now this is competition api again you

198
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,960
can either use one or the other and

199
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:16,400
view js3 it doesn't really matter um but

200
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,638
i would start

201
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:20,080
to use composition api for more bigger

202
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:23,840
components again we'll go

203
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:25,198
through that but um

204
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:28,638
it just really helps our kind of code

205
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:28,639
reusability and we kind of show that

206
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,680
so just again for the people that don't

207
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,880
maybe know vue.js here these are all the

208
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,120
kind of options

209
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,719
so this is the option based api and you

210
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,520
have these different sections you have

211
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,520
like the

212
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:43,840
the prop section the data the method the

213
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:46,080
computed components watch and mounted

214
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:47,758
and these are all the kind of things

215
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,599
this is really good really structured

216
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:51,280
grads understand this you know people

217
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:53,120
that haven't done javascript before they

218
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,039
can kind of go oh i need to do a new

219
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,639
method i do in the method section i need

220
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:58,080
to do a computer property i do in the

221
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:00,319
computer property section

222
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:02,000
only issue with this with this structure

223
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:04,639
as your um

224
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,919
components get bigger and bigger it cut

225
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:08,160
it's harder to maintain

226
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:09,198
and it's harder to reuse some features

227
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,120
you might have in it

228
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:12,880
so you might have a method in here that

229
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,080
looks after the greeting

230
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:16,159
and you have a message here and they

231
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:17,280
kind of work hand in hand say

232
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,000
when you want to use that in another

233
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:21,440
component you can't extract both of them

234
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,080
with the options api

235
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:26,080
so you can extract this into like the

236
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,758
method into a javascript file but then

237
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,960
the other kind of the reactive data

238
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:30,720
stuff

239
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:32,159
it doesn't follow it or if you're

240
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,319
watching the

241
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,680
the data property there that doesn't

242
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:36,880
follow it either you can't extract it

243
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,360
down that's the kind of issue

244
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,880
that they had and i've seen in my own

245
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,599
kind of programming and own products

246
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,440
that we make

247
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:45,120
like some components i can't bring down

248
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,560
far enough and there might be pairing

249
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,400
components really

250
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,680
and the composition api is kind of going

251
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,039
to solve that

252
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,120
again with some of these features you're

253
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:54,400
kind of like i kind of knew about the

254
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,599
problem but then there's a solution

255
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,120
you're like actually that's a solution

256
00:07:55,599 --> 00:08:00,240
okay

257
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:02,319
so and it's really it's about

258
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:04,080
like maintaining that's all i want in

259
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:05,919
the products is about maintaining

260
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,440
and readability making that high quality

261
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:09,840
look

262
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,800
so the composition api again i just took

263
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,479
this from

264
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,120
view skills which is quite a good

265
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:17,199
resource you've seen before

266
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,400
that there was the different sections

267
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:20,560
export default and there was the

268
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:23,919
different sections in the options api

269
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,879
and now here you just have one method

270
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:27,840
called setup

271
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,639
and in setup you can define any of your

272
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,840
different

273
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:32,719
um your different functions that you

274
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,559
want to use

275
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:36,479
so you can kind of like what you do is

276
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:38,640
you import reactive or compute it

277
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:40,800
and you say actually i just want to do

278
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:43,360
the um

279
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:45,040
reactive bit and i want to do my method

280
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,680
and i want to return that so it's

281
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,560
available

282
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,959
in the template again the thing is about

283
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,839
this

284
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:54,319
is like you define what you want and you

285
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:56,320
return what you want then

286
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,320
big thing about this as well is this can

287
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:02,160
all be an object from like line

288
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:04,240
uh 12 to kind of uh 19 you can put that

289
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,839
in a separate javascript file then

290
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,360
so you're kind of like having you're

291
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:08,959
monitoring your state of the account

292
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:11,519
you're also updating the account in one

293
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:13,439
javascript file so you can export it

294
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:14,720
or have it imported from a javascript

295
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,519
file into your

296
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,240
um component and then you can use any

297
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,440
other component

298
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,040
so all the kind of properties are

299
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,120
following each other the computer and

300
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,599
the watch so that's kind of that makes

301
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,800
it a bit

302
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:28,959
uh easier to maintain

303
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,640
you can also reuse that kind of pattern

304
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:33,518
over and over again

305
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:35,839
now the only issue i find with this and

306
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:38,080
the thing we have with the options api

307
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:39,920
nice and structured nice nicely done

308
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,760
grads can kind of and senior engineers

309
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,599
can kind of understand it quickly

310
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,439
and implement it and you can kind of do

311
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,920
your code reviews work quite good

312
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:49,040
with this you can do whatever you want

313
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,719
anywhere you want

314
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,160
again within your own company or within

315
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,800
your code you have to come up some

316
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,360
pattern

317
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,240
that somebody doesn't just put a method

318
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,000
up here

319
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:00,080
and then compute it and then another

320
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,800
method and then reactive properties at

321
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,880
the end

322
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,880
you know you can kind of really create

323
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:07,439
unstructured

324
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:08,959
patterns then so with great power comes

325
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,680
great responsibility on yourselves to

326
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:10,719
kind of do that

327
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:13,839
and that's what i see it may be a

328
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,839
problem in the future with it

329
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:19,279
just to show you the difference um that

330
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,399
it's it's really the same it's just

331
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:22,800
another way of doing it

332
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:23,519
again you can either use composition or

333
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:28,319
optional

334
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:31,519
api there so again we have here we have

335
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:35,680
money and delta and they're reactive

336
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:38,320
and we get the the um

337
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:40,399
those functions from view so exactly as

338
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:43,360
well so the one thing i couldn't do

339
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:44,640
um with the view at three code base is

340
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:47,040
get composition working

341
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:48,880
so i imported it from view two again you

342
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,959
can get composition in your view to

343
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,480
application at the moment so this is

344
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:53,680
just my work around for now

345
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,760
so what i can do is i can have

346
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:57,599
reactivity money in delta and i can

347
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:59,200
that's it kind of maps to the options

348
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:02,160
api there

349
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:04,560
i can also do computed which then maps

350
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:06,560
to the computer kind of uh

351
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,839
function in the options api again

352
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,119
they're all kind of following the thing

353
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:10,480
so it's the same kind of thing it's just

354
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,519
a different way in a different pattern

355
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,760
of doing it

356
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:14,800
the only thing is i can export this this

357
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:17,279
section here

358
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,240
to here to a javascript file and call

359
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:21,200
that a feature

360
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,320
and then import it into my component and

361
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:25,600
then all i have to do

362
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:28,320
is return that object

363
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:30,560
and then it's part of the html then i

364
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,640
can use that kind of functions in html

365
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:34,239
so again just with this as well just to

366
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:36,800
explain it with the composition api

367
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,839
everything you define you have to return

368
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,599
so i have delta

369
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:41,279
money there are two reactive properties

370
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,720
i have to return them to be reactive in

371
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:44,720
the html

372
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,720
and then formatted money is a computer

373
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,240
property and then add as a method which

374
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:50,160
i'll use in my html

375
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,440
so i have to return them at the end and

376
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:54,000
they're part of the setup and that's all

377
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,000
i have to do

378
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:57,600
then

379
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:59,199
so that's the kind of composition how

380
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,560
they kind of map to each other i think

381
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,639
it's quite powerful i think it's going

382
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:05,680
to be a lot of reusability available

383
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:06,160
on it okay this is another feature does

384
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,319
anybody

385
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,680
has anybody pay portal does anybody know

386
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,279
portal is

387
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,800
okay about half the correct okay so

388
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:13,839
portal is like you have a gun you shoot

389
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,800
the wall yeah

390
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:18,320
and then it creates like um a portal and

391
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,599
you shoot the gun at another wall

392
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,920
and it creates a kind of connection

393
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,519
between them yeah so i can jump in that

394
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,519
portal and i can peer up there

395
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:26,639
so sometimes you might want that in your

396
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:28,079
in your dom yeah

397
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:30,240
you want to want to define something

398
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:31,680
when i'm coding in a certain section in

399
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,360
the dom or a web component

400
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,880
but when it renders i want it somewhere

401
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,399
else in the dom do you know that kind of

402
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:38,639
way so i'll bring it through kind of

403
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:40,639
idea again this is useful for kind of

404
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:42,399
pop-ups and modals

405
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:43,680
and notifications where they're kind of

406
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:44,800
like nearly at the end of the body

407
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,719
sometimes because you don't want them

408
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,560
interfering with the rest of the dom

409
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,680
so but really when you're maintaining it

410
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,479
you don't want to be going up and down

411
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,079
going okay

412
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,360
this is the button that enables the

413
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:55,279
modal but then i have to go to the

414
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:57,519
bottom page to kind of look at that code

415
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:58,959
but this allows you to kind of co-locate

416
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:00,560
the information when you're programming

417
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:03,199
but when it's kind of uh

418
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:04,839
executing then it uh renders somewhere

419
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:08,720
else so i'll just show you a quick

420
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:11,279
example here is a card class

421
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:12,079
and here i have like a button and when i

422
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:15,200
click the button

423
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:17,599
this section appears there

424
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:19,440
so that's fine it's just a v show when v

425
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:22,000
show just

426
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:23,440
toggles the display css attribute to

427
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,680
kind of none and show

428
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,800
so that's all it does but i don't want

429
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:30,239
this class

430
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:32,479
user class here interfering with my

431
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,519
with my like little section here it

432
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,600
might have stuff

433
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:37,519
the css that i don't want to have it but

434
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,800
what i really do want is i want this

435
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:40,160
section here

436
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,839
located next to the button because i

437
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:44,480
want the grads to understand

438
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:45,760
this button and this is connected but

439
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,600
really what i have to do

440
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:49,120
and if this is a modal kind of if i had

441
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:51,040
a class called modal

442
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:53,120
they might interfere with each other or

443
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,719
this class might interfere with it then

444
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,959
so i would have to move it out of here

445
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:59,360
and to the end of the body then

446
00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:00,399
so that's what portal does it says i can

447
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,320
define it here

448
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:03,680
and this is the kind of idea is i can

449
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,720
define it in this nested kind of

450
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:07,279
component

451
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,320
when i'm programming so and what i'm

452
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,680
saying is a target

453
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,440
and when it's running it actually

454
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:13,519
appears somewhere else in the dom so i

455
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:15,040
could say here when i'm programming

456
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:17,040
this is the portal and this is how

457
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:19,839
javascript or the vue.js knows

458
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:20,639
it's wrapped in a portal element and

459
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:22,880
then when it's

460
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:24,079
uh running it will actually it's

461
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,199
probably what it's doing is a very

462
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:28,719
simple like

463
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:30,240
um find and replace so it's going

464
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,760
find me all the portals and then i'll

465
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,240
replace them wherever they say pop-up

466
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,839
target

467
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:36,000
so you have to have that so that's like

468
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:40,000
your portal like i shoot up the wall

469
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:41,360
that's my target um that's my source

470
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,880
and then i want to move this to where

471
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,399
the target is at the end of the room so

472
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,839
that's the kind of way it's doing it

473
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:47,120
again i never had that kind of

474
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:48,959
i did have that problem but i didn't

475
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,880
realize it until this again this is

476
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:53,839
available in vue.js too through

477
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:54,800
the uh viewportal um api but now it's

478
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:56,560
part of the core

479
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:58,319
and when i was looking through the code

480
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,839
this is part of the

481
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,040
code already so you can see there's

482
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:01,680
three different types we would go

483
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:06,160
through

484
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:08,880
there so again this is just showing you

485
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:10,399
that i can co-locate them now so the

486
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:12,800
problem i had two slides ago

487
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:13,440
i had a button but i want to say this

488
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:17,439
button

489
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:19,839
enables this kind of um say modal or

490
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:21,600
or a show and then it will actually

491
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:24,240
wherever i have to

492
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:26,320
put an id pop-up target it will appear

493
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:30,160
there in the rendered

494
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:35,199
html so that's what it's kind of solving

495
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:35,199
so yeah so it's kind of um

496
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,279
it's a handy feature i think as well so

497
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:40,000
keeping co-locating getting more

498
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:41,360
maintainable

499
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,720
and people understand that okay this

500
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,440
button and this is the code that it

501
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,720
activates

502
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,639
and then when it's rendering you don't

503
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,240
care because it's just for the

504
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:49,759
rendering somewhere else again you can

505
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:52,160
use it for other things

506
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:53,600
uh especially there like so so that's

507
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,839
the kind of portal feature

508
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:57,360
suspense is another one that's in court

509
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:59,279
that's part of the core now

510
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,399
it used to be in view two i would use a

511
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:02,399
thing called view weight

512
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:03,759
plug-in so the view weight is like do

513
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:05,440
you know when i fetch information

514
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:07,680
i want a loading kind of bar sitting

515
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:09,440
there now they've brought that into the

516
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:11,199
core so it's part of the default thing

517
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,320
and this is a type that it understands

518
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:13,599
vgs3

519
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:16,079
so all i'm just saying here is this

520
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:18,959
template as soon as it's uh

521
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:20,239
ready then display this component here

522
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:22,638
so it's just kind of like

523
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,759
uh when you're doing a fetch say when

524
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:25,600
the fetch is finished

525
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:27,199
then say fetch finished and then it will

526
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,959
display that and it's just a handy thing

527
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:31,120
to do your loading again react has

528
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:35,199
brought that into their core as well

529
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:36,399
with that render triggered this is a

530
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:38,160
really handy thing

531
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:40,160
so render trigger is part of the life

532
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,920
cycle now of web component

533
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:43,360
so this is a web component for vue.js

534
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,560
and you have these uh different

535
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,880
lifecycle methods

536
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:48,880
and now it's render triggered so render

537
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:51,279
triggered when it triggers something

538
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,800
to have to kind of render again it will

539
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:53,519
run this function and you can kind of

540
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,199
put like

541
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:56,639
debugging information or you can put

542
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:58,639
debugger there and say

543
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:00,160
actually you render it again why did it

544
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:01,199
you can kind of investigate it

545
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:03,120
again you can look at kind of

546
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:04,079
performance improvements there again

547
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:07,679
that wasn't available

548
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:07,678
in view two

549
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:13,280
fragments fragments is a handy one as

550
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:16,480
well i haven't

551
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:19,678
had a use for at the moment

552
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:21,760
but the thing is with view is in your

553
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:23,839
template section here

554
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:25,439
which is kind of figured out is you need

555
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:27,678
one root node

556
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:29,600
or one root element so you have a view

557
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:32,400
instance and one root

558
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:33,120
element you have to have that connection

559
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,880
sometimes

560
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:36,959
just for sake you might have a wrapper

561
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,600
node around our wrapper element around

562
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,360
your code

563
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:41,280
just because you will complain about it

564
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:43,120
if you have like

565
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:45,120
just these three elements here input

566
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,959
span p and you don't have fragments

567
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,760
around it view will say you don't have a

568
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,440
root element

569
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:51,360
you need to create one now sometimes you

570
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:54,799
just might create one just to have it

571
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:58,320
um just to make it um

572
00:17:54,799 --> 00:18:00,080
happy there so one thing is you can do

573
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:02,080
is you can wrap fragment around it again

574
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,360
fragment is a type that view understands

575
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:05,199
now in view three

576
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:06,799
again i had to use the view fragment

577
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:09,919
again it was a plug-in

578
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:10,960
and you can import it and that's how it

579
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:13,840
kind of

580
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,960
is useful then so again this could be

581
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,959
stuff for like

582
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:19,200
the parent wants to be the wrap around

583
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:21,280
three three like um

584
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,400
elements so you don't want to have to do

585
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,760
the wrapping yourself

586
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,600
in this web component just for the sake

587
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,879
of it so as soon as this compiles it

588
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,799
gets rid of fragment

589
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:32,640
that doesn't appear in your html or any

590
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:34,080
divs or any anything there like so

591
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,240
so this is the kind of output of

592
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,280
fragment as well how it actually

593
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,679
monitors

594
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:42,000
which elements are together within the

595
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:44,400
fragment is it has a fragment id so

596
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:48,080
that's how you know so we had three

597
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:50,480
in the last one over here so this

598
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:51,120
we had three elements we had input span

599
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,320
and

600
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:54,479
that represented all those three

601
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:56,080
elements and then that's

602
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:58,000
the output so that's how fragments kind

603
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:59,520
of monitoring uh

604
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,280
how they're connected together usually

605
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,879
what have they noticed is

606
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:04,399
it would have a div around them and

607
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:06,960
that's how it knows it together

608
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:10,000
and it would have an id on that div so

609
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:12,559
that's a kind of workaround then for it

610
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,960
another change as well is v model

611
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:14,960
changes

612
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:20,080
so v model changes is we have a parent

613
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,840
here

614
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:23,199
called settings that's a component and

615
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,559
then we have a set in cards which is a

616
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:28,160
child of

617
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:29,678
settings parent so what i want to show

618
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,919
you is how we would do that

619
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:32,880
in view two is we would have you can't

620
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:35,440
maybe can't see it

621
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,720
is we would have one v model to do the

622
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,640
username

623
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,919
and then we would have two props to do

624
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:43,440
email and

625
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:46,559
location um there

626
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:49,120
so then we would input that in and

627
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:50,960
on this side then we have for the v

628
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:53,039
model we'd have to have a prop called

629
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:55,679
value so v model

630
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:57,600
um has to when you do v model you have

631
00:19:55,679 --> 00:20:00,080
to have a value in your custom

632
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:01,678
component there so then you would have

633
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,799
to say i actually need more information

634
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:04,480
that has to be reactive

635
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:06,639
and two-way binding so you have to

636
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:09,919
create props and then you have to create

637
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:12,720
emitters then or events so here

638
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:14,400
i have to do props and i have to call

639
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:16,240
one of them value as well

640
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,679
so that's the only thing and then i have

641
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,799
to look after this so again it's a bit

642
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:21,280
verbose

643
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:23,520
but then avenue kind of seen that people

644
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:25,678
wanted actual multiple

645
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:27,600
v model properties now you can name them

646
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:31,039
you could say v model.username or

647
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:31,840
colon username v model email a v model

648
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:34,559
location

649
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:35,199
and now they'll come in as actual props

650
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:38,000
username

651
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,720
email location again and all you have to

652
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,600
do though

653
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:42,799
is you have to omit a update and the

654
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,559
name of the prop

655
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:47,600
and again it will look after it and

656
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:50,960
it'll be reactive again it's nicer code

657
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:52,399
and it's more maintainable there another

658
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:54,480
thing they've introduced as well is

659
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:56,159
custom modifiers so in view two you have

660
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,840
custom modifiers like trim

661
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:59,600
for your input so you want to make sure

662
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:03,678
it takes out the space

663
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:05,520
or you might have lazy or um

664
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:07,200
or a number so they kind of like modify

665
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:09,840
the information when it's emitted up

666
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:11,440
straight away so now that you couldn't

667
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,918
do it in view two but now you can do

668
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,240
your own

669
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:15,440
uh modifier so you can kind of go dot

670
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,280
reverse

671
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:19,360
and that's all that is a prop and you

672
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:20,879
say if top reverse is true

673
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:22,080
then when i admit the information i'll

674
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,799
actually reverse the information

675
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:25,199
beforehand

676
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:28,320
again it's just a boolean for you so

677
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,320
that's the kind of information

678
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,320
another thing as well i haven't really

679
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,440
used it myself is there's a new custom

680
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:36,559
directive api

681
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:38,240
that's how you do directives in view two

682
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:41,120
now it's kind of following the way the

683
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:44,000
lifecycle of an actual component in view

684
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:46,158
three and view two so again you have in

685
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,720
your component and a normal one

686
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:50,400
is before mounted before update that's

687
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:52,640
that life cycle

688
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:54,400
in view three but it was a bit confusing

689
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:56,000
here so i think evan you had thought

690
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,200
why don't we make component directed the

691
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,960
same kind of life cycles they're the

692
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,000
same names and people understand it from

693
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,520
a web component

694
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,880
i haven't used it yet but it's something

695
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,679
like i think this makes it easier for

696
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:06,480
people to

697
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:06,480
understand that

698
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:12,080
one other thing as well that's changed

699
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:13,120
and it might i haven't kind of tried it

700
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,480
out yet because i don't have the

701
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:17,520
compiler to kind of change

702
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:20,000
dot view files to outputs is

703
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:20,559
view reactivity so how view reactive

704
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:25,760
works

705
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:28,559
in view two is you have

706
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:29,440
a data or you have a thing called touch

707
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:31,600
like a

708
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:34,000
reactive element called or property

709
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:35,678
called touch

710
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,280
when you create that it uses a thing

711
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:39,600
called object.define

712
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:41,200
property to get a setter and get her on

713
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,719
it and in the setter

714
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,559
it would kind of weave in its own code

715
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:47,039
to say when this is set

716
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:48,480
notify people that are interested in

717
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:50,158
when this changes

718
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,919
and this is the watcher the watchers

719
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:54,559
kind of always kind of gets notified

720
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:57,120
that's that watcher section

721
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:57,840
once it's kind of the setter is like you

722
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,840
change that

723
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:01,120
value of the touch property to something

724
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,799
else the watcher will be

725
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:04,320
run and the watcher will say if you're

726
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:07,120
watching this

727
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:08,480
then re-render so we'll call the render

728
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,840
function again and that's how it kind of

729
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:12,240
re-renders the stuff

730
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:13,678
so how it's changed in view three and

731
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:18,960
you shouldn't see it really

732
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:20,559
um is it's using the es6 proxy before it

733
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:23,200
was used in define

734
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:24,799
define properties so again one thing you

735
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:28,159
should see and i can't deny it

736
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:29,840
uh our claim is true is you see

737
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:31,679
and performance improvement that's what

738
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:34,320
they're saying i can't deny a

739
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:35,600
thing so that's one thing you might just

740
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:38,480
by upgrading to view three see a

741
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:40,240
performance improvement then

742
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:41,760
so other things just if you want to see

743
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,559
the code base it's there i'm running

744
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,320
that time

745
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:46,320
view amsterdam is in three weeks if you

746
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:48,158
want to go to it official view

747
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:49,520
podcast by view mastery there if you

748
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:51,360
want to keep up to date that's how i

749
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:53,279
keep it

750
00:23:51,360 --> 00:24:02,879
and that's all the questions i have

751
00:23:53,279 --> 00:24:02,880
there okay
