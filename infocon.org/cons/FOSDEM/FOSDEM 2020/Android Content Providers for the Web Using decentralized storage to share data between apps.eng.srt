1
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:09,679
thank you for the introduction

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,000
uh what was it introduction sorry for

3
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:12,559
the

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,160
talk before because it was really great

5
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:17,198
introduction for my talk

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:21,119
i want to build on top of that um

7
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:22,400
so i'm uh friedrich i'm the maintainer

8
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:25,359
of the

9
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:26,080
android sdk of blockstack and i want to

10
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,160
talk about

11
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,880
how you can use decentralized identity

12
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:34,239
in a way

13
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:35,680
that well i'm really excited about

14
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:37,360
it's kind of new technology

15
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:40,079
decentralized and everything

16
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:41,920
society might not be ready and if

17
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:43,120
there's blockchain involved this is not

18
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,320
financial advice

19
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:49,120
so just disclaimer i'm

20
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,480
android developer for many years and the

21
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:52,959
concept that really

22
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,839
excites me is the android content

23
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,160
providers

24
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,840
the idea is that many apps can access

25
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,559
the same data

26
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,199
this happens on android device through

27
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:04,158
this

28
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:05,199
type component is content provider and

29
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:08,080
it's backed by

30
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:09,679
files or also maybe by the cloud but

31
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:12,960
really the interesting idea is that

32
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:15,920
your contacts your images your calendar

33
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:17,520
sits at one place and many applications

34
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,920
can make use of them you do not have to

35
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,080
type them again and again again

36
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,840
and now the question is how can we get

37
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:28,000
this to the web

38
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:31,119
um and this is possible

39
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,759
because we have now identities

40
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:35,439
that are decentralized identities that

41
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:39,119
you can use to make

42
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:42,240
to well to associate your data with

43
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:44,560
um so we heard decentralized identity we

44
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:47,520
have a w3 working group

45
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,399
um it is self-sovereign other people can

46
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,399
verify it

47
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:52,240
we had a demo really here five minutes

48
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:56,240
ago great

49
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:58,240
so it's really about cryptographic keys

50
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,839
once we have a cryptographic key then we

51
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:02,880
can make work

52
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:06,479
uh with the with the data

53
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:09,280
and um there we have

54
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:11,680
this authenticator that owns the private

55
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,599
key that manages your private keys

56
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,800
and application can ask this

57
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:19,280
authenticator

58
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:23,120
to give you some information

59
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:27,040
some piece that you can prove

60
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:29,200
to that you are the owner of the key

61
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:31,519
um so i i skipped this we had the

62
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:34,160
introduction how this the id

63
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:36,080
looks like so you do not have to have a

64
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:39,280
password any anymore

65
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:42,239
you have 45 different ways how you can

66
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:44,560
create your decentralized identity and

67
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:45,840
blocksec is one of them we saw ethereum

68
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:49,680
version

69
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:51,280
in the talk before so the idea is

70
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,040
when you log in when you auto can

71
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,800
authenticate to your device

72
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,239
um you are creating with your

73
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:00,080
cryptographic keys

74
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:01,680
some kind of a proof that you own this

75
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:05,040
key

76
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:07,440
and um yeah

77
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,879
so for ethereum there's for example

78
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:12,079
three box as well

79
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:14,799
uh they really have a nice uh concept

80
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:18,879
where you associate a way your identity

81
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:21,920
is represented with a profile and

82
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:24,319
this is the ethereum address and you get

83
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:28,079
some information about the user

84
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:30,958
and blockstack using

85
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,400
a more human readable way to represent

86
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:36,560
your identity

87
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:38,720
but it's really about that you

88
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,560
can have a proof that you own this

89
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:43,840
private key in the end

90
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:45,200
and the app wants to have this proof so

91
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:49,519
that they can

92
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:51,359
act in act on behalf of the user

93
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:53,280
interact with other users exchange

94
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:56,319
encrypted messages

95
00:03:53,280 --> 00:04:00,000
talk to other services or other users

96
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:02,159
so once we have this proof uh

97
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,120
we might want to store our data at a

98
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:06,239
place

99
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,599
uh that where they know i am the owner

100
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:09,519
of this data

101
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:10,798
and that's where we come back to the

102
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:13,840
android content provider

103
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:17,519
so we want to have a concept where

104
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:20,880
the user can access or give applications

105
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:23,040
authority to access this data and

106
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,880
decentralized storage there are

107
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:27,199
different possibilities

108
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,719
the idea is that we don't want to have

109
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:31,840
these honeypots anymore

110
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:34,800
we had to talk yesterday web3 why

111
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:36,159
this is really bad and they're different

112
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,840
possibilities

113
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,230
but the applications in the end they

114
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,599
don't want to

115
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:43,919
[Music]

116
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,800
don't want to manage all the data of all

117
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:47,919
users

118
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:50,320
but the idea is that the user is

119
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:52,799
managing their own data

120
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:54,400
so we want to get get away from the

121
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:58,160
state where we now

122
00:04:54,400 --> 00:05:01,120
that applications databases

123
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:02,400
manage all the users several times for

124
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:06,160
different application

125
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:08,080
abcd facebook google and so on

126
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:11,840
we want to move to a place where one

127
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,840
user can manage their own data

128
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:16,159
so for the content provider what does it

129
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,400
mean on the device

130
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:21,360
so we have the authenticator and the

131
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:24,479
user can now give proof to the

132
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:27,360
application that they can act

133
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:29,520
on behalf of the user and access for

134
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,360
example the images

135
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:33,440
so there's one particular key that

136
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,680
allows you to access your images

137
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:37,520
somewhere in the cloud probably there's

138
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,639
a concept of identity hub

139
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:43,198
but this standardization details

140
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,840
i just want to make sure that the idea

141
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:47,600
is

142
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:49,280
clear you can give another key only to

143
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,639
one application and then this

144
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:54,000
application is allowed

145
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:56,960
to access your contact data

146
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,319
and so this these are web applications

147
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,919
so they are served

148
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:03,600
from the web but they are sitting on

149
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:06,799
your device and they're working locally

150
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:10,560
and um

151
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:13,840
so the uh yeah it's it's about

152
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:16,160
oh let's see we have the two examples to

153
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:18,479
compare a bit the authenticator

154
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,319
block stack uh you have a web app where

155
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:21,599
you authenticate yourself so they manage

156
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:25,440
your keys in a web app

157
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:28,160
running on your device three box has the

158
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:29,039
web three authenticators so there you

159
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,960
have different

160
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:32,400
browser extensions also on to manage

161
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:35,198
your private keys

162
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,520
and then for the storage there you have

163
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:38,639
in

164
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:40,000
three box um orbit db that is based on

165
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:43,039
ipfs

166
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,120
and you have it's key value based and

167
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:47,680
in block stack you have gaia protocol

168
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:50,000
that is based on

169
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,840
existing cloud storage so really fast in

170
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,199
performance and cheap

171
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:55,758
it's firebased and what is kind of

172
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:59,360
missing

173
00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:00,160
