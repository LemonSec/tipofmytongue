1
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,639
hello welcome back again

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,080
our next speaker is leo van der wusstein

3
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:13,678
he will be talking about

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,839
what he would like to see in catalog

5
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:19,198
zones but this talk is aimed at

6
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:21,840
dns developers floor is yours

7
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:23,279
in 15 minutes hello uh welcome and

8
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,160
thanks for being here

9
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:26,880
uh this is my first presentation ever so

10
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,359
i'm

11
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,640
nervous so i'll try to calm down if i'm

12
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:33,680
talking too fast then

13
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,880
let me know uh also i think it will be a

14
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:38,559
short presentation after

15
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:39,200
andrei's fair and the other complicated

16
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:43,040
uh

17
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:45,120
uh presentations um well my name is leo

18
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:48,320
frustein

19
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:50,879
i'm a dynas operator

20
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:53,360
i operate a large anycast for the second

21
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:53,360
largest

22
00:00:54,239 --> 00:01:00,000
registry and besides that

23
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,680
we have other name servers that do a lot

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,959
of domain names

25
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:06,400
uh a couple of million and we tried to

26
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:08,880
maintain those

27
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:11,119
and i came across catalog songs which i

28
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:14,560
found very interesting

29
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:16,400
but uh was wasn't that scalable yet

30
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,880
but uh still the concept i found

31
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,880
interesting

32
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:27,840
it is uh

33
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:36,320
so there's not much new um

34
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:41,840
shall i put her in the back yeah maybe

35
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:41,839
that's better

36
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:52,240
sort of intuition uh so it's it's

37
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:54,240
already a working concept

38
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,280
and another warning is that the

39
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,479
presentation was

40
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:01,280
prepared very uh quickly

41
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:03,200
uh and i have code examples that have

42
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,119
tiny fonts so if you want to see the

43
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,040
codes then maybe open already the

44
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:08,560
the slides on your laptop so you can

45
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,280
read it because maybe you cannot read it

46
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:13,360
here

47
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:16,480
okay let's go well

48
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:18,879
i as i said i run anycast and

49
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,560
of course i need to generate

50
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:23,120
configurations so

51
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,840
i run uh like seven top level domain

52
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:27,200
names

53
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:28,720
uh on on many locations and i run them

54
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,280
all in separate demons so

55
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,239
i ended up with hundreds of demons so

56
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,959
the the

57
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:36,160
the way to configure this uh the usual

58
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:39,680
way i think is

59
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:42,319
to use uh python jr and yaml

60
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:44,640
uh and then synchronize that

61
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:47,359
configuration and then you have to

62
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,399
reload that configuration to yeah to be

63
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,840
loaded

64
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:53,519
um yeah that needs uh

65
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,599
a provisioning a place where you

66
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:59,440
proficient where you

67
00:02:55,599 --> 00:03:02,480
where you start provisioning to those uh

68
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:06,239
demons over out of band

69
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,720
and uh yeah um so that's that's i think

70
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:10,239
an uh

71
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:13,920
a common uh setup uh catalog zones

72
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:16,480
uh contain the information

73
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:18,238
that's uh like variable in your

74
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,200
configuration so basically the list of

75
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,440
zones

76
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,238
that you need to be loaded that you need

77
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:25,280
to have

78
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:27,360
loaded in your daemon

79
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,799
the configuration of the daemon is not

80
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:32,560
so addressed but

81
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:35,920
the catalog zone is so this is an a

82
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:39,360
code example that is working

83
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,839
um uh yeah what what can i tell about it

84
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,680
uh

85
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:44,799
yeah yeah simply you load have it in the

86
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,879
master

87
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:51,920
and your your secondaries will

88
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:53,280
load this and then the ptrs on the right

89
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:56,798
side you see the domain names that

90
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:59,680
need to be loaded and on the when you do

91
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:02,239
a ddns call on your master

92
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,959
the ptr record will be added or be

93
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:05,760
removed

94
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:06,720
and then all your secondaries will load

95
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,599
that zone or

96
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,599
delete that song

97
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:15,599
yeah so that this

98
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,040
yeah is simply working i did that it's

99
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:19,918
fine so

100
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,639
but what i did is extending it a bit

101
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:24,159
because

102
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:27,280
uh not at the moment only bind supports

103
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,880
catalog zones and you want to have

104
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,320
you want to use this concept also in

105
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:34,240
other demons

106
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:34,960
so uh with the additional section on the

107
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,320
bottom

108
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:41,919
i can iterate over the zone oh wait

109
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:43,520
uh i'm already at the next slide so uh

110
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:45,840
at the bottom here you see

111
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:47,198
uh additional config that you can put in

112
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:50,400
there like your masters

113
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:53,600
like uh where to um

114
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:57,359
allow notifies from uh allow transfer uh

115
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:59,440
transfer form uh but yeah

116
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,440
the main important thing is the the the

117
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:04,240
stuff on the top

118
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,639
so the here's the the the stuff that i

119
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,919
added

120
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:11,600
it's simply a zona md record

121
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:12,719
which i use for the integrity of the

122
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,440
data

123
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:17,600
and it's a new record i think it's still

124
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:21,039
still a draft

125
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:24,240
and you see the number 240 in there

126
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:27,360
in that line that

127
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:30,240
is a field that

128
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,280
is reserved for uh private use so you

129
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:35,280
can use it for

130
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:38,638
uh um make putting hashes of parts

131
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:42,000
of your uh of your records

132
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:45,280
and even just a part of the value of uh

133
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,160
of a resource record that's that's all

134
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:49,440
up to you

135
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:52,720
and i use it to generate

136
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:53,280
a list of domain names uh that i can

137
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,000
compare

138
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:57,198
in in other demons if they're if they're

139
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,720
present or not

140
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:04,840
and then run commands uh the the the

141
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:06,639
vendor-specific commands to do your

142
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:09,198
mutations

143
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:10,960
okay so yeah the benefit is that you

144
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:11,759
don't need to reconfigure it it's it

145
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:15,680
because uh

146
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:18,400
automatically by by uh the the

147
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:20,720
how do you say when when the catalog

148
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:23,840
zone is being refreshed

149
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:27,280
so yeah that doesn't evolve

150
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:30,000
that much work anymore um

151
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,880
well you don't need fender specific

152
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
commands for

153
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:36,479
maintaining it

154
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,199
well actually there's more like a future

155
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:39,758
thing because

156
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:40,800
right now it's not that's uh supported

157
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:43,360
yet

158
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,000
and you don't need additional support

159
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,560
which

160
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,280
i usually use rsync or sap or whatever

161
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:51,759
you use

162
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:55,119
to to have your configuration proficient

163
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:59,520
and for that you also need the user um

164
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:59,520
plus yeah let's say you are a dns

165
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,800
you perfect you serve dns for multiple

166
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,318
registries

167
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,000
then you can have a catalog zone for

168
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:10,240
each of your customer

169
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,199
and they can maintain that catalog zone

170
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,520
uh

171
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:16,400
and then your secondaries will add and

172
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:19,120
delete domain names that in those

173
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,120
in those demons

174
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:24,080
yeah and it simplifies a lot uh

175
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:28,080
i did a little bit of abuse of the rr

176
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,599
type

177
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:32,318
in the beginning to to come to this

178
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:36,159
resource initially i wanted to use the

179
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:40,800
nxt record which is uh yeah absolute

180
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:45,440
uh yeah it's the next record uh

181
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:47,599
yeah sorry um then i tried the the

182
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,599
the

183
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:56,400
and what is it the zona status record

184
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:59,280
uh which is uh assigned by uh by icon

185
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,638
but it does not have a real rfc only

186
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:03,039
that only had a draft

187
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:03,840
and therefore it's not supported in dns

188
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:06,240
python

189
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,119
nor in not and not not in lsd so the

190
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,639
record does not

191
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:13,440
exist in there but

192
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:14,160
while i was experimenting then at the

193
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,560
same time

194
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,840
cloudflare made the info record

195
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,240
unobsolated

196
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,840
and that's the then the record that i uh

197
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:25,680
yeah kind of abuse

198
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:28,400
for this so i

199
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,520
still have a wish list of uh that that

200
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:32,478
um

201
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:35,120
i would like to have added in the in the

202
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:38,320
expired draft for uh catalog zones

203
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:42,640
uh which is uh yeah uh doing uh

204
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,640
define your masters with the srv record

205
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:46,160
[Music]

206
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:48,479
let's see so you have to read from my

207
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,480
slide

208
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,800
yeah and do your your your master's a

209
00:08:55,279 --> 00:09:01,600
bit different about the gods

210
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:04,719
example uh speak uh speaks for itself

211
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:06,240
so yeah to to have this uh standard and

212
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:09,360
i think uh

213
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:11,839
additional work needs to be done um

214
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,800
so i think uh we i have to convince

215
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:15,519
vendors of uh

216
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:19,279
authoritative software to to use this

217
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:19,279
but yeah first it needs to be a standard

218
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,440
and i don't know how much enthusiasm and

219
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:27,680
to share some there is

220
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:27,680
for it um

221
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,640
yeah so imbined it's supported and the

222
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,079
others is not so for the ones that it's

223
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:39,199
not supported and now you

224
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:43,360
have to use additional software and that

225
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:46,880
i don't like so much of course so

226
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:50,560
i will put code examples on

227
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:54,320
my my websites which is dns dot company

228
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:54,640
slash catso that there's at the moment

229
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,440
not

230
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:59,680
not that much yet but i will soon put

231
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:02,480
more stuff there

232
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:05,439
this is a list of references which

233
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:08,640
contain all the the white papers and

234
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:10,399
tutorials i think yeah

235
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:12,880
you have to read it later on if you're

236
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:12,880
interested

237
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:18,470
that's the last slide questions thank

238
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:24,319
you leo

239
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:26,480
[Applause]

240
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,480
oh

241
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,560
this is andre isc so thank you leo i

242
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,399
think thank you for

243
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,680
being brave to doing your first

244
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:38,480
presentation here

245
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:39,680
um so uh with the catalog zone the

246
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,279
situation is

247
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:44,479
a little bit complicated because there's

248
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:47,279
a draft lying in itf

249
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,640
which nobody has a time to finish for

250
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:50,560
the catalog zones too

251
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,079
so if you wanted if you want to be

252
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:54,399
cauter of the draft

253
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:55,199
it would be great because it needs more

254
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:58,800
work

255
00:10:55,200 --> 00:11:00,880
and then yeah then

256
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:03,040
our implementation in bar needs to be

257
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:05,360
updated to to match the

258
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:07,439
new draft we also have some uh other

259
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,640
ideas what could be put into catalog

260
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,839
zones and

261
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:13,199
uh but still um well we had some plan

262
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:16,320
and then the oh came

263
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:19,600
and we just need had to like

264
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:21,279
replant the thing so so doh is the new

265
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,519
kid on the block that's blocking all the

266
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:26,399
health consuming all the time

267
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:28,480
well not not all of it but but it it

268
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:30,560
consumes some of the time which we had

269
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:33,360
to reserve for the catholic zones

270
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,839
um and then we need to synchronize with

271
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,079
like

272
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:37,279
these faults that those falls and the

273
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:39,279
seas that nick

274
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:40,560
who isn't here but i don't know if even

275
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:43,760
if they are going to implement

276
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:46,719
our catalytic zones yet but

277
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:48,079
yes any help that anybody using

278
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:51,839
catalytic zones can

279
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:52,959
give us the dls developers in terms of

280
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:56,800
specification

281
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:57,199
or even like testing it or even patches

282
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,399
are

283
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:01,519
always welcome so so if you are a dns

284
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:03,600
developer and and

285
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:05,680
care about catalog zones and can you can

286
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:08,720
you help with the bind code or

287
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:12,160
nsd code or power dns code

288
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:16,880
we all would like to accept patches from

289
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:19,600
from anybody a good patches

290
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,600
okay thank you

291
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:25,439
as well okay that's nice to hear this is

292
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,120
william of vanellet labs who said he

293
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:29,200
would like to help with that as well

294
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,959
well as it's question time i can also

295
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:33,680
ask you a question did anyone

296
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:36,089
tried it in the audience catalog zones

297
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:38,319
in general

298
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:40,639
[Laughter]

299
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,600
okay that's not that much but yeah maybe

300
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:45,279
if people understand

301
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:46,880
the benefits of it then yeah speaking uh

302
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:49,040
from power dns the problem we see is

303
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:51,279
that we know everybody wants this

304
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,560
but none of the people that want this

305
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:54,800
are paying customers

306
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:57,359
yeah there's no overlap there which

307
00:12:54,800 --> 00:13:01,599
means we're not going to pull that card

308
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:01,600
which means you i think like

309
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:05,519
actually in my code example if you look

310
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:08,560
in my code example

311
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:09,040
it's here so you see on the right a

312
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,119
number

313
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,719
an id for the domain name yeah and

314
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:16,240
that's actually the power unis

315
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:17,600
domain id yeah so and then

316
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,360
we said you were doing an external

317
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,560
implementation the current net

318
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,839
experimental

319
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:24,959
implementation is also external it talks

320
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:28,000
to the api but i

321
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:30,160
still i i in in 1999 i used

322
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,000
powerdns i think and then i still have

323
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,639
this this database the naming is still

324
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,519
the same

325
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:36,320
right and okay and the other field that

326
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:39,519
you see there

327
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:42,720
left to the id is the is the soar

328
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:46,160
so there then you can use it to look up

329
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:50,399
in your local authority

330
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:52,800
if you're in sync with the master yeah

331
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:55,519
all right any other questions for leo or

332
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,519
from leo

333
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:06,000
okay thank you again thank you

334
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:14,240
i'll be back in five minutes with a

335
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:14,240
final speaker
