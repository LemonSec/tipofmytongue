1
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:09,360
so hi everyone and thank you for

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,559
joining this presentation it was

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,879
originally it was

4
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:15,120
originally cancelled because uh cathy

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:17,119
who presented this abstract could not

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,198
come so

7
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:21,920
from i was a contributor in the project

8
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:23,199
and i said somebody should

9
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:26,480
speak about this project because it's

10
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:29,119
amazing and finally it's me to do it so

11
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:31,439
i try to transcribe a previous

12
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:35,040
presentation she made in singapore

13
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:37,360
and uh maybe we speak from a more

14
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,200
a community aspect of the project not

15
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:41,200
from inside mozilla because i'm just a

16
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,360
contributor

17
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,039
so the tutor is a presentation it's an

18
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:47,120
iot forecast

19
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:48,239
without clouds this is a sun that's

20
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,239
maybe

21
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:53,199
another topic because it's raining today

22
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:55,919
but it's quite promising so

23
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:58,000
first what is this project about the

24
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,280
main motivation it was to create and to

25
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,280
build a platform

26
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,520
that can address some smart home use

27
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,519
cases so basically this is

28
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:08,479
a few automation of different device you

29
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:11,680
have connected together to a

30
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:14,320
single place and it can

31
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,080
solve many problems you can find today

32
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,720
on the market because there is

33
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,880
some concern about security iot and

34
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,320
security is a long story people are very

35
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:25,439
scared because it's a

36
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,158
there is a huge potential of privacy

37
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:29,839
leaks

38
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:32,880
and even safety issues so if you

39
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:35,119
if you have higher exposure you're more

40
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:37,439
exposed to problems so if you're

41
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:40,799
using device which are available system

42
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:44,720
okay but you know that known system is

43
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:47,520
really not a cable so that's one

44
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:50,240
problem you need to reduce uh exposure

45
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:52,479
so if your gateway is running home

46
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,158
then you have more chance to be less

47
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:55,840
attacked from the outside

48
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:57,200
interval ability is also interesting

49
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:00,560
because we have

50
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:02,560
in iot context we have a different uh

51
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,280
different approach but mostly it's

52
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:07,920
always zero so this is verticals from

53
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,038
device to application which means that

54
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,800
you have like a

55
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:12,480
thousand of remote control instead of

56
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,200
thousands of remote control to control

57
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,200
each

58
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,200
device you have thousands of apps on

59
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:20,000
your phone and uh

60
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,359
no way to make them working together so

61
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,400
that's a problem

62
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,840
it's mostly a market issue not a

63
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,640
technical problem because if you want

64
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,640
some

65
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,679
interoperability we have some solution

66
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:33,359
to do this

67
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:36,400
privacy already spoke about this and um

68
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:38,800
yeah so running your

69
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,000
smart home with diy project can be time

70
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,720
consuming so

71
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,480
this project is trying to make it easier

72
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,200
for everyone even non-developers they

73
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,599
can

74
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:50,319
deploy this soft solution on without too

75
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:53,119
much effort

76
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:55,440
so yeah what's uh this slide is about uh

77
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:58,319
ceo i've just explained so

78
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,760
uh for different reasons most products

79
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:01,679
we have on the market are

80
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,959
relying on the cloud which is operating

81
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,159
your device so you

82
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:07,280
don't have the control through your

83
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:07,760
device directly but you are using a

84
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,400
cloud

85
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:12,000
proxy which which has access to the

86
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,000
device itself so this means that

87
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,280
if there is some internet failure home

88
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,920
or anywhere

89
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,480
you your screw you cannot do anything so

90
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,238
some

91
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,840
i have implemented some fallback option

92
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:26,319
but

93
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:26,319
this cloud application is not

94
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,519
spontaneous took the opposite directions

95
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,359
he said okay

96
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:32,640
if i can control directly to my device

97
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,200
or to some

98
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:37,040
some units that can speak to the device

99
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:39,599
i'm solving all those cloud

100
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,879
issues and specifically in europe and

101
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:42,959
it's also in uk

102
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:46,079
now there is a lot of regulation we're

103
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:48,799
trying to enforce more privacy in system

104
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,720
so if you you have two different

105
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:51,760
approach either you try to ensure

106
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:55,280
security and

107
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:59,040
privacy at the cloud level or either you

108
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:02,239
decide not to take

109
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:04,159
user data and let him

110
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:06,400
manage his own data so in this case

111
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:09,040
you're not in position of

112
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:12,159
doing any disclosure or bad bad

113
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:14,560
exploitation of user data

114
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:15,519
so it's a decent life the web of thing

115
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,238
approach

116
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:20,320
i would say it's uh the original

117
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:22,560
internet spirit of uh

118
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,320
the ways to design a system because the

119
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,479
internet was made of this

120
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,360
of this motivation of interoperability

121
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:30,800
and

122
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:32,000
a mesh network without any central point

123
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,440
of failure so

124
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:39,120
we are reproducing this is somehow um

125
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:40,639
so you can so if you want to get things

126
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,000
started in the project so the first

127
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:44,240
there is the gateway which is just a

128
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,400
software component where i will uh

129
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,000
explain about it later and then you can

130
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,239
buy different device or

131
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,919
build your own device that's interesting

132
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,960
if you want to learn things i recommend

133
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:55,840
to try

134
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:59,599
and um they are speaking a common

135
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:59,599
language this is called the web things

136
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,160
so as i said yeah you have the

137
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,919
combination of mozilla gateway which is

138
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,560
software you can deploy in a raspberry

139
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:10,400
pi

140
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:13,280
different device and then uh

141
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,560
we can ensure some level of privacy by

142
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,479
this by design

143
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,600
because everything stays on your own

144
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:22,159
network

145
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:24,479
so i would say it's quite uh trustworthy

146
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:26,160
so for security that's an optional

147
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:28,080
feature i'm showing here

148
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,600
you can access to the gateway from the

149
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,440
outside so

150
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,199
if you remember what i said first that

151
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,960
if you are

152
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:36,800
making a larger exposure you can be

153
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:40,080
subject to attacks

154
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:42,960
so the ways security is handling here

155
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:44,000
so you're not getting into the gateway

156
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,000
from the outside

157
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,440
it's the gateway which is opening a

158
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,440
tunnel to um

159
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:54,639
to the mozilla iot subdomain and then

160
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:58,000
you can enter from this

161
00:05:54,639 --> 00:06:00,720
tunnel to back to your

162
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,840
system but it's not mozilla who get

163
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,639
access to your

164
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:06,880
to your to your gateway that's something

165
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:08,720
you should know

166
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,919
and again this is an optional feature if

167
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,960
you are working in a disconnected

168
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:13,120
environment

169
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:15,359
you can just skip this and you can get

170
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:17,440
local access

171
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,400
so yeah for interoperability i used to

172
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,479
work on this

173
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,080
before and um i would say that the

174
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:24,800
mozilla approach is quite

175
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,520
smart because they try to let's say

176
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,080
replicate

177
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,440
what's working the web as we know it as

178
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:32,080
http html

179
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:33,360
for upgrading webpage and try to do this

180
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,680
differently

181
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,919
in a higher t context so it was based on

182
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,919
effort made by as a double literacy

183
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:40,960
there is a working group called web of

184
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:43,680
things

185
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:45,680
and it's you really use different

186
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,759
technologies that already existed

187
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,120
and created everything from scratch and

188
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:52,880
try to make it more

189
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:56,240
adapt for adapted for iot concerns so

190
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:57,039
basically you'll find http websocket for

191
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:01,039
real time

192
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:05,680
json description for rest api and so on

193
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:09,120
and all other iot uh protocols or radio

194
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:11,520
are already standardized there is

195
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,599
interoperability bridge between uh zb

196
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:15,440
for instance and the web of things

197
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:17,120
and our system is running on the

198
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,639
internet

199
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,560
internet technology not the internet

200
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:24,240
itself

201
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:26,000
so we are if there is a community

202
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,000
it's a development is open so that's

203
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,639
pretty cool because you can see the

204
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,360
feature

205
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:33,039
ongoing and if you find any issue on the

206
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,080
master branch and so on you can reach

207
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:36,479
developers

208
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:38,800
easily you can get the source code

209
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:41,520
report issue we have an rsc channel

210
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:45,039
and now movies moving to matrix as

211
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:46,000
mozilla is moving from higher c to

212
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:49,120
matrix but i

213
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,800
you will reach people both sides at the

214
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:54,160
moment

215
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:57,360
so from an architecture point of view

216
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:59,440
it's a node.js application so the

217
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,879
software i'm going to explain here is

218
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:03,360
the gateway itself

219
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:04,960
so basically it's a server when you can

220
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,000
connect all the device so you need to

221
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,159
register them

222
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,199
so you have different uh way to add the

223
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:12,400
devices

224
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:14,800
so it's done at the moment by your ui so

225
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:17,919
you have like a wizard when you can

226
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:22,080
search for device at them and so on

227
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:22,080
and it's with a node.js

228
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:27,199
express service where you have all the

229
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:31,280
ui and all the endpoints

230
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:33,440
for all the logic and um

231
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:34,399
as um something really smart i believe

232
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,839
it was it was

233
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:38,000
at the beginning it was designed to be

234
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:40,000
extensible for his new stuff so

235
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,679
that's something i i want to emphasize

236
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,599
this that's the community

237
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:46,319
and i made a couple of them but now we

238
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:49,279
have about 100

239
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:50,959
contributions for managing i don't know

240
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:53,279
i made some from

241
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:54,079
activity pub master done clients so if i

242
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:56,880
want my

243
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,760
device to talk to my friends i can do it

244
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,120
using this

245
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,480
and if you want to bridge this to

246
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,880
anything you can do this i think

247
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:06,160
somebody also made a

248
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:07,120
github tracker this means when there is

249
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,880
a new bug you can

250
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:11,760
raise an alarm in your home or whatever

251
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:13,360
you want so it's only just

252
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:16,560
event an action so you can do whatever

253
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:19,839
you you you need

254
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:21,199
so yeah so you have a direct control of

255
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:24,000
your device

256
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:25,519
there is no middleman there is no

257
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,480
exposure to the other side

258
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:30,160
you can deploy it but you bought

259
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,880
yourself

260
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:34,800
uh your data stay home you can enable

261
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,640
some feature for logging your data and

262
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,000
so on but it's say under your control so

263
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:40,480
this means

264
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,240
everything stay on your raspberry pi sd

265
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:45,120
card

266
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:47,200
and uh yeah you can expand the ecosystem

267
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:50,320
with other device which are

268
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,920
dumb devices but that speaks the website

269
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,839
api

270
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:56,479
so for the demonstration she used to

271
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:59,519
make a demonstration of her home

272
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:02,160
in california but

273
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:04,880
maybe i will not get access to her home

274
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:06,560
that would be a privacy evaluation

275
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:10,000
so i will maybe show you a couple of

276
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:10,000
other things i'm doing now

277
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:19,839
okay so

278
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:26,640
so what you see here

279
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:33,279
is my desk home i have made this

280
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:36,720
diy i have a very slow connection here

281
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:40,399
so i made a diy robot which is my

282
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:41,360
own website and i made an api to control

283
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:44,079
it so

284
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,640
here is a dashboard so this is a gateway

285
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:47,120
view of

286
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:49,920
all the things i have on so here is a

287
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,920
light for instance

288
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:54,640
okay it's turned on i can change the

289
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,240
color

290
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:58,839
what color do you want to make sure it's

291
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:01,279
not a fake demo

292
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:04,000
purple

293
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:04,000
pink okay

294
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:17,760
okay this isn't and uh

295
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:25,200
yeah you can add some virtual device

296
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,199
like a micro switch so you can

297
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:30,720
get uh some some connection between all

298
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:34,800
the

299
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,800
devices so it will be

300
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:42,320
let's create some kind of uh new rule

301
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:44,560
like so

302
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,360
let's uh okay now i mean maybe i can

303
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:48,319
turn my

304
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,320
others off

305
00:11:55,120 --> 00:12:00,079
so let's say i have this actuator so you

306
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:02,000
know what is a sensor right

307
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:03,680
but an actuator is the opposite

308
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,880
something that is producing value

309
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:08,160
what's uh so now which is consuming

310
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:10,560
value so er is

311
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:12,079
simulating an action for instance if i

312
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:15,250
change the on state of

313
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:17,199
my switch i can decide to

314
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:19,200
[Music]

315
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,959
change the color of my light for

316
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:25,120
instance

317
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:28,239
to yellow

318
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:30,720
okay so yeah then they are linked

319
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:33,120
so basically this means that so if i'm

320
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:37,120
turning it on

321
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:40,560
oh it's already yellow yellowish

322
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:43,839
but you see it doesn't turn off because

323
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:44,160
why because i set if keyword that's it's

324
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:46,720
only

325
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:47,279
uh when there is a change i should put a

326
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,279
wire

327
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:50,560
this mean when when it's on it should

328
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:53,519
turn yellow

329
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:54,560
and when it's off i should create

330
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:58,320
another rule to say

331
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:58,319
another color so let's do it

332
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:11,360
um

333
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:15,920
okay so on the left the actuator

334
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:15,920
on the right the color

335
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:20,800
and i said on off then i can change the

336
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,040
color

337
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,040
here

338
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:37,279
blue

339
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:39,040
okay it was off so now it's yellow and

340
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:42,160
now it's starting to

341
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:45,360
so i can show you more

342
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:45,760
oh yeah this is a yeah another hack

343
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,839
maybe

344
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:49,839
in the video it will be faster

345
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:55,279
so yeah i made some experimentation

346
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,199
trying to

347
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:59,040
emerge reality is a real one in the

348
00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:00,319
virtual one so i'm using some color

349
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,000
sensor

350
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,920
which is measuring uh the color of

351
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,680
obviously and then

352
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:08,240
from i made a web application which is

353
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:11,760
display updating the color of

354
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:13,440
of the sensor in a 3d so it's an a frame

355
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:15,120
scene and if you don't know about this

356
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:18,160
framework it's pretty it's

357
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:21,199
quite interesting because you can create

358
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:23,680
vr just like writing html you don't have

359
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:25,839
to write any javascript it's mostly uh

360
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,479
tags you just describe the scene and so

361
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:28,480
on

362
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,760
so yeah here it's just running on the vr

363
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:32,320
headset and uh

364
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:33,439
sorry for the quality but what's uh it's

365
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,360
interesting here

366
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:37,600
that you can reach some web things

367
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:39,040
directly i'm passing a local address of

368
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:43,199
my uh

369
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:46,639
sensor and it's updating accordingly so

370
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:48,240
even if you if you don't want to use uh

371
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:50,160
of if you have other needs that's a

372
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,240
smartphone platform you can use this

373
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,839
api to describe things and it's quite

374
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:56,800
convenient for

375
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:59,440
describing uh physical objects and

376
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:03,680
flexible enough yeah

377
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:06,720
so here is a in a ar version of it

378
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:10,839
i think it's a magic clip device um

379
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:14,480
and then yeah i tried to made a a 3d

380
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:17,839
controller of my uh

381
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:19,440
get my gate my website gateway so what

382
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:21,360
you see on the bottom right

383
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,880
it's a 3d view of all the widgets you

384
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:27,680
have in a 2d

385
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:31,120
which is a svg dashboard

386
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:33,120
so you can explore runs or the device so

387
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:35,120
it was mostly a proof of concept so what

388
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:39,600
i'm what am i doing here

389
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:42,079
um i think i'm

390
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,360
so yeah this is all the switch you can

391
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:46,959
see here

392
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:48,320
there is a smart outlet i think i have

393
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:50,959
the same

394
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:52,800
on this side and i can decide to control

395
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:56,000
it directly with a

396
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:59,920
vr controller so that's a

397
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:02,320
nice concept so here is my 11 amp

398
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,319
on top

399
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:09,519
so if you want to get started you need

400
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:11,839
to get a raspberry pi you can

401
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:14,079
also run it on your regular system like

402
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:16,639
um i suppose

403
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:17,359
mac should work but i'm a linux guy so

404
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:20,560
anyway

405
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:23,920
you can run it in the container or

406
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:28,160
okay so here is the same version of the

407
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:30,800
the the dashboard but in 3d so you can

408
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:35,199
look all around

409
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:37,839
and uh yeah i think i'm doing the same

410
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:37,839
here

411
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:41,759
oh here another hack so yeah i tried to

412
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,880
mix

413
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:47,680
some video

414
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:49,120
coming my webcam output and try to

415
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:52,239
inject it into a vr

416
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:55,759
world but it's really

417
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,759
very weird

418
00:16:55,839 --> 00:17:00,560
so i'm controlling the fan i don't know

419
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:04,720
if you see it show it

420
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:04,720
okay that's one demonstration yeah

421
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:09,520
if there is any question i can take them

422
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:18,959
now

423
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:23,280
more or less yeah okay thank you

424
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:25,839
anybody has questions one time

425
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,839
two times

426
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:33,918
hello uh thanks for your presentation

427
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,640
i'm not sure if you know this but i'm

428
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:38,960
wondering

429
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:39,679
uh about if there is like some market

430
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:43,360
research

431
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:44,080
on uh iot adoption because i think like

432
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:46,159
in principle

433
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:47,760
technology has been around for a while

434
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,840
and uh

435
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:51,520
i probably in recent times i think

436
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:53,360
probably for the last of

437
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:55,520
five or six years there's like a lot

438
00:17:53,360 --> 00:18:00,080
more of this but i haven't really

439
00:17:55,520 --> 00:18:01,200
seen um other than maybe like nest or

440
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:04,720
things like that

441
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:08,240
like a big uh consumer adoption

442
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:11,200
of iot or am i mistaken

443
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:12,000
um i know that um mozilla is a working

444
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:15,679
group

445
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:18,960
i don't remember the name which is um

446
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:19,760
um do you know them maybe some of you in

447
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,720
the room know so

448
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:24,400
they try to to try to identify the back

449
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:27,280
practicing products and uh

450
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:28,000
for instance for christmas they were

451
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:31,200
publishing like

452
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,799
a selling uh selling instruction and

453
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:36,160
recommendation which device

454
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:36,960
should be used and not so i suppose they

455
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:40,320
are well

456
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:42,000
based on different uh

457
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,760
yeah different studies like you so we're

458
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,240
suggesting so you should

459
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:46,879
you should try to contact them here it's

460
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:51,039
um

461
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:51,430
i don't remember the name of it mozilla

462
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:54,549
um

463
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:54,549
[Music]

464
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:59,120
so yeah if you look at which iot device

465
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:01,120
should i buy if i care about this

466
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:03,439
maybe you'll find this but it depends on

467
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:06,879
the countries for instance and uh

468
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:09,600
something i didn't mention but

469
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,720
in france in europe we have a very

470
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,320
strong regulation

471
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:14,559
not not the regression is that strong

472
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:15,120
but the principle are quite strong

473
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:18,080
because

474
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,479
the gdpr regulation has one article

475
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:21,760
which

476
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:24,799
is anything about recommendation for

477
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:26,160
making system with privacy by design and

478
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:27,840
by default

479
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,520
and if you look at what is on the market

480
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:31,760
today i'm

481
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:33,440
will be really surprised to see if any

482
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:36,960
comprises here

483
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:39,039
so today we care about privacy mostly

484
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,400
about the personal information mostly

485
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:42,960
social media or

486
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:44,799
even personal communication but iot has

487
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:48,400
a huge huge

488
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:50,320
impact on people's life so

489
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,919
yeah i think it's an opportunity for a

490
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,600
platform like this one or any open

491
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:56,080
source software because privacy is

492
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,879
some part of our dna with the disease

493
00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:00,480
from day

494
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:03,200
zero so let's let's move on here yeah

495
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,200
another one so

496
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,879
um thanks so much for for showing all of

497
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,919
this i'm

498
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:12,240
i love uh automation but i'm like

499
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:14,159
privacy to me is a big blocker to like

500
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:16,159
doing this kind of projects at home

501
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:17,760
but saying this it's like i don't know i

502
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:19,760
find it super fascinating

503
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:21,520
do you know of any alternatives to like

504
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:23,039
alexa or things that could receive voice

505
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:24,320
commands that doesn't go through like

506
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:26,240
google amazon or

507
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:27,918
okay excellent question i think you

508
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:31,600
should stay in the room because somebody

509
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:34,080
will speak let's talk about common voice

510
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,959
so i can reveal some secrets because

511
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:38,158
there was this

512
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:41,600
all ends session in berlin and

513
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:43,120
some mozillian team with iot guy and

514
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,559
they managed to make it work as a proof

515
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:46,840
of concept so

516
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:48,559
it should be deployed sooner or later

517
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:50,320
yeah

518
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:52,720
thank you for the talk uh just a

519
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,720
question

520
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:59,760
right cool uh is it possible to update

521
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:03,120
firmware yes

522
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:05,520
i think it's enabled by default uh

523
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:07,120
it's maybe an option but yeah but it's

524
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:10,799
uh yeah

525
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:13,600
uh basically yeah it's working

526
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:14,799
it's already working uh you can update

527
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:18,000
the wall platform

528
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:21,280
but also the add-ons individually so

529
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,640
yeah so that's a good question a good

530
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:25,200
remark because if you are

531
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,610
super paranoid enabling uh updates can

532
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,960
be a

533
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:29,360
[Music]

534
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:30,640
sort of a source of issue so if somebody

535
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:34,240
hijacks the update

536
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:39,290
so yeah that's an interesting topic

537
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:42,840
more questions no thank you philippe

538
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:45,840
