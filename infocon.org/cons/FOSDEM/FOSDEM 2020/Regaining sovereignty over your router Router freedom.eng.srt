1
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:07,759
right

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:09,599
hello welcome to the lightning talks for

3
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:11,120
today your first talk is on

4
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:14,960
uh regaining the sovereignty of your

5
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:17,038
router from lucas lesotho

6
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,160
hello everybody thank you very much for

7
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:21,119

00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:24,160
that you took your time

10
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,599
and your efforts to be here and for a

11
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,640
long day yesterday

12
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:31,039
but yeah so uh today we're gonna talk

13
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,320
about a very interesting topic that it's

14
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:34,399
not just a legal

15
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,000
borrowing topic for lawyers but it

16
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:38,960
concerns all of us

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,920
yeah so i'm lucas la sota i'm work for

18
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,559
fsfp

19
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:45,200
i'm a deputy legal coordinator and i'm

20
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:48,480
directly involved with this campaign

21
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,680
well uh in order to talk a little bit

22
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,718
what is router freedom

23
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:56,160
i divided my uh presentation in three

24
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:59,199
parts so first of all we're gonna see

25
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,398
how it affects each one of us or why

26
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:03,680
it's important

27
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:05,840
and then we will see also um some

28
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:07,680
basic legal aspects in order to

29
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,080
understand what is going on

30
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,040
on europe concerning route of freedom

31
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,039
and then

32
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,080
the third part and the most important

33
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,360
one how

34
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:20,640
each one of you can take part on uh

35
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:23,039
on this activity and have your own

36
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,759
free router at home because we think

37
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,720
that it's

38
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,360
very important for us to enforce our

39
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,640
rights

40
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:34,479
and to have um control

41
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:39,360
and sovereignty over our own equipment

42
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:41,840
so uh what is basically router freedom

43
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:45,360
well a route of freedom is the right

44
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:48,320
that every customers has

45
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,960
to use their own equipment at home or at

46
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:54,798
work

47
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:57,199
so isp internet services providers they

48
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:59,759
usually they force their own routers to

49
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:03,360
their customers and they don't allow

50
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:06,799
we customers to use our own

51
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:08,000
router so router freedom is the right

52
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:10,479
that each one of us

53
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,560
has to use our own equipment when we are

54
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:13,520
connecting to the internet if you want

55
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,920
to use

56
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,599
a router that has installed free

57
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:21,679
software inside of it

58
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:22,079
we can so and there's a lot of arguments

59
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,640
uh

60
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,280
i listed the four of the most important

61
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,920
one

62
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,720
uh but there and we're gonna see that

63
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,440
effect

64
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:33,519
uh these four arguments is already

65
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,319
enough to see how that is important for

66
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:37,280
each one of us

67
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:37,920
the first one is well freedom of choice

68
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,959
we are

69
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:42,640
uh we have this right to use uh the

70
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:46,239
equipment that we want

71
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:48,839
uh this is a right that has been

72
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:50,319
confirmed and has been protected by

73
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:53,440
european uh

74
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:55,440
right law i'm sorry so the second

75
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:58,480
argument is that when we have

76
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:01,440
a rotor uh a free rotor

77
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:03,280
or i mean a rotor that we have free

78
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,480
software in it i wrote that we can

79
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:08,080
choose to use

80
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:11,440
it's um privacy friendly so

81
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:14,560
we use that in order to protect

82
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:16,800
our own data well

83
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,760
from this qualified audience we all know

84
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,480
that uh

85
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:22,319
all our data our communication our

86
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,760
encryption our backups

87
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:26,000
everything that is connected to the

88
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:29,200
internet go through our router

89
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:32,480
and uh if we have some

90
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:35,760
problems with that of course our uh

91
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:38,879
digital sovereignty is under uh

92
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,840
on danger well the third argument uh

93
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:44,239
free competition

94
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:47,440
and comparability right there well um

95
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:50,560
isp has created our entire market

96
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:52,959
around uh the lack of rotor freedom so

97
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,879
if you want to to connect the internet

98
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:57,280
they can provide you a very simple

99
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:59,359
router without wi-fi ah do you want

100
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,840
wi-fi then you have to pay more for that

101
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,599
oh you want to use more computers to

102
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,239
access the internet you have to pay more

103
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:07,119
for that

104
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:07,840
so this is very bad for the user and

105
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,920
besides

106
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:14,720
when we have just a few uh

107
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,359
rotors manufacturers in the market we

108
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,320
start to have

109
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,519
a monopoly and they have control our

110
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:22,560
technology

111
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:25,680
and fsfe is

112
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,400
is completely different about that we as

113
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,040
users

114
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,599
we must control our technology not other

115
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,080
people

116
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,880
imposing their control over our own

117
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,599
equipment

118
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:37,040
and of course the security argument the

119
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,199
security argument maybe

120
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,479
for a few of us is the most important

121
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:43,520
one because

122
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:47,758
if there is some problems uh

123
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:50,639
with the isp uh router or

124
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:51,280
if they are slowly providing uh updates

125
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:54,880
the critical

126
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:57,119
updates we uh having our own equipment

127
00:04:54,880 --> 00:05:01,039
we can install by ourselves

128
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:04,400
a program of software

129
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:07,120
that uh is more secure that is based on

130
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,159
community aspect and not just uh what

131
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,560
isp

132
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,440
uh things so basically these are the

133
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:15,440
arguments that

134
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:17,600
uh we are trying to push on and try to

135
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:19,520
educate people and to say yes let's do

136
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,960
let's use our own router because this is

137
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:23,680
very important yeah

138
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,080
so let's talk a little bit about the

139
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,080
legal

140
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:28,479
issues i promise you that it's not going

141
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:31,680
to be boring it's very

142
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:35,120
uh uh it's very straightforward

143
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:37,360
to understand so since 2015

144
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,240
there is this net net neutrality

145
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,280
directive

146
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:43,199
and in the article 3 it is that every

147
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,479
citizen every citizen every european

148
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:47,120
citizen has the right

149
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:49,280
to use and to choose their own equipment

150
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:52,479
they call it term

151
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:54,559
of their choice and then in 2018

152
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:55,758
uh there is a very important piece of

153
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,680
lazy jason saying

154
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:58,880
uh called european electronic

155
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,680
communications code

156
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:03,680
saying that all the definitions that uh

157
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,600
public authorities and

158
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,520
uh and private actors all the

159
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:10,479
definitions that applies

160
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,960
to equipment into applies to routers

161
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:14,400
must

162
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:17,440
be inc must be adjusted to ensure

163
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:20,159
net neutrality well but

164
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:21,120
there is a small problem and let's see

165
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,160
what is this

166
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:27,440
small legal problem

167
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:29,840
some isps are telling that okay

168
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,880
users have the right to choose their own

169
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:34,638
rota

170
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:38,159
but in fact rotor is part of

171
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:41,039
the public network so if a router is not

172
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,600
a pro it's not property from users they

173
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:44,960
are

174
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:47,759
isp uh property and

175
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,560
we think that is very bad um this

176
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:52,160
discussion

177
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:55,360
uh has reached the european level

178
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,680
and uh has reached the barrack a little

179
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,680
bit

180
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:01,039
america is the board of european

181
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:04,080
regulators of economic uh communications

182
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:07,440
and uh they say yeah well

183
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:10,639
uh router is part of the public

184
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:11,840
network and then users have no right to

185
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:16,160
choose it because it's

186
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:18,880
our property right uh but we at fscp we

187
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,680
have this been fighting this war for

188
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:23,919
years

189
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:25,680
and in germany we uh manage in 2016 to

190
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:29,120
pass the rotor law

191
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,120
that says that in fact

192
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:36,800
the network termination point that where

193
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:40,159
the network the public network ends

194
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,120
it ends in the wall so in the plug where

195
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,520
you can

196
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,560
plug your modem or your rotor and

197
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:47,758
everything that's

198
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:50,000
inside your home it's your property and

199
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:53,520
you have the right to choose your own

200
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:56,720
equipment yes however

201
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:59,359
this is not like this in all europe

202
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:01,599
so uh we have conducted a research in

203
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:04,879
that fsp and we have

204
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:06,319
uh seen that uh it's not like this there

205
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:09,520
in other countries

206
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:12,560
people although these rules

207
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:13,758
are already uh present in european

208
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,960
legislation

209
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:20,240
in in in those uh countries who have

210
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:23,120
already implemented this european regul

211
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,479
european rules international uh uh

212
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,520
legislation

213
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:30,318
there are uh still a

214
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:31,758
lack of awareness so as we can see here

215
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:34,800
a lot of countries

216
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:38,080
uh users cannot use their

217
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:40,319
own routers so uh isp

218
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,279
by contract regulations they impose

219
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:44,399
their own

220
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:45,920
routers to users and they cannot choose

221
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:49,120
their own equipment

222
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:51,760
well and how uh here

223
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,480
where things started to get interesting

224
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,640
because

225
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,000
we can do something about it and you can

226
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:59,199
do something about it

227
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:02,000
so we divided in two things

228
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:03,279
if you wanted to uh organize an activity

229
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,800
in your own country

230
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:08,800
uh uh here in belgium uh well in

231
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:11,519
every european country if you wanted to

232
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:13,920
start um

233
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:15,279
an activist campaign for router freedom

234
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:18,399
we have prepared

235
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:21,279
a wiki with a lot of information

236
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:22,160
beginning from zero how to speak with

237
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:24,320
isp

238
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,439
how to speak with the national

239
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:28,320
authorities uh

240
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,680
uh and public authorities and how to

241
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,680
organize yourself

242
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:33,439
which arguments you can use which

243
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:36,959
counter arguments you can use

244
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:41,040
so everything is um

245
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:44,079
is is written on our wiki and

246
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:47,279
our work in fsp it's all about

247
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:50,160
community so uh we don't

248
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:51,120
uh we cannot and we don't do anything by

249
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,439
ourselves

250
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,399
it's our commitment it's everybody

251
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,839
working together

252
00:09:54,399 --> 00:10:00,959
and raising our voice and showing uh

253

isp

255
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:08,320
that we uh have the right

256
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:09,519
to use our own equipment so we have

257
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:13,040
prepared it please

258
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:14,000
use it go there check it uh try to

259
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:17,279
communicate

260
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,399
with your public uh with your political

261
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:21,439
representatives

262
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:22,720
in order to spread this board and in

263
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:26,240
order to have

264
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:29,920
your own rotor in your uh in your own

265
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,880
house so since we are in the university

266
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:34,000
here today

267
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:37,839
i have prepared a small homework

268
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:41,839
for for for you so tomorrow

269
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:45,040
monday or this week we will try to check

270
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:45,600
router freedom by ourselves this is very

271
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,160
easy

272
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,279
this is experiment uh i think it's very

273
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:52,800
good for you and

274
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:56,480
for us in order to have a more precise

275
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:59,439
panorama uh about voter freedom

276
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:00,640
in europe so what is the homework what

277
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:04,399
is the task

278
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:06,959
first contact your or a random isp

279
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:07,440
in your region so i think everybody uh

280
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:10,160
has

281
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:12,079
a connection to the internet you have uh

282
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:15,439
an icp in your home in your

283
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:19,680
in your city in your region call them

284
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:21,680
send a short email or if you are not

285
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,959
pleasant to if you are sap or you are

286
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:26,239
you are planning to change

287
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:29,040
your isp okay just contact

288
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,240
your future isp send them an email and

289
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:33,040
say

290
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:34,000
number two i want to use my own road i

291
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,920
have bought my

292
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,040
router in ebay i have bought my own

293
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:39,680
router on

294
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:41,360
on internet i want to use it i am

295
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:44,000
allowed to do that

296
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,200
and maybe they will say yes you are

297
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,800
maybe you are not

298
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:50,800
and then you ask for the login data

299
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:53,279
logging data to public network this is

300
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:56,560
very important because

301
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:59,519
uh in order to have your own router uh

302
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:00,079
working at home you need uh your own

303
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:03,839
login

304
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:05,519
data uh login data to public network so

305
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:07,839
send them a message and say i want to

306
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:11,920
use my own router please provide

307
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:14,560
uh the public network uh login data

308
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,360
and then let's see what's happening and

309
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:18,399
then

310
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:20,800
if they say yeah fine

311
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:21,760
cool if they say no you are not allowed

312
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:26,279
to do that

313
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:29,590
please share your experience at

314
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:30,880

your region

325
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:57,839

and if you have questions please let's

331
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:14,399
discuss it

332
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:16,959
[Applause]

333
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:17,920
from a technical perspective there is

334
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:21,040
some cases like

335
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:23,279
cable networks where

336
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:24,319
custom equipment could harm the

337
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:26,720
neighbors so

338
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,600
it could not be totally free should we

339
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,959
be pushing

340
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:33,519
for an android-like solution that the

341
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:34,079
the kind of termination inside the

342
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:36,639
router

343
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:37,519
is a closed and certified block and then

344
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:40,880
the rest of the

345
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:44,480
router is open yeah so in fact

346
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:46,480
um the barrack the board of european

347
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:48,560
regulators they are analyzing the

348
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:51,199
technical aspects and they have

349
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:52,800
provided the guidelines in order to how

350
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:56,000
to do that in order to not

351
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,479
harm the public network however we do

352
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,120
think

353
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,839
that with subregulations we can do that

354
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,839
but not

355
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,880
restricting the right to users to use

356
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:06,079
their own equipment

357
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:08,639
it's perfectly uh uh

358
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:09,359
it's perfectly fine to use our own

359
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,680
equipment

360
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:14,480
in order also to not to harm the public

361
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,479
network uh

362
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,240
yeah that's a good question because then

363
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:35,279
involves another type of

364
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:38,320
uh of yeah legal considerations

365
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:41,360
yeah uh here we would like to

366
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:43,600
uh to at least at least at least

367
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,639
enforce the equipment to have access to

368
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,800
internet yeah

369
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:48,320
because tv it's a little bit different

370
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,639
but uh when we are

371
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:52,800
wanted to have access to the internet

372
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:54,560
usually they do this combo thing

373
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:56,079
and they put everything in in the same

374
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:58,239
box but i would like

375
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:59,920
yeah okay so for tv it's fine but i

376
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,760
would like to have my own

377
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:03,040
private connection to the internet and

378
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:05,279
then uh

379
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,319
things started to get a little bit messy

380
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:09,199
so um

381
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:10,240
this uh uh example here is would be to

382
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:13,599
have the rota

383
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:14,160
for the internet yep i think we're out

384
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,840
of time

385
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:23,368
okay thank you very much thank you very

386
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:23,369
[Applause]

387
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:28,320
