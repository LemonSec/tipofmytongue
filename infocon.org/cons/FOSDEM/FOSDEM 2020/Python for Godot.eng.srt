1
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:10,080
there we go

2
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:13,519
so thank you everyone for being here all

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:15,920
right on time uh

4
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:17,759
today i'd like to talk to you about the

5
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:20,560
goddard game engine

6
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,840
and python and why the two can really

7
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:26,799
get along

8
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:30,560
nicely my name is emmanuel by the way

9
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:33,760
i'm french maybe you heard my accent so

10
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:36,800
what is godot i guess most of you

11
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:38,160
know about godhat maybe people who don't

12
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:41,199
know

13
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:43,599
okay so i can skip this slide

14
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,239
oh yeah really fast godot is a

15
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,680
incredible

16
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:50,239
game engine fully open source which

17
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:51,199
ships to plenty of platform mobile web

18
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:55,680
etc

19
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:55,680
there is a 2d 3d graphic

20
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:01,600
um

21
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:03,440
sorry physical engine uh

22
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,199
you can export you can do plenty of

23
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:08,479
thing basically it's

24
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:12,479
the best game in china ever except

25
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:15,520
one or two like you know unity and

26
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:19,119
unreal and all the others but whatever

27
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:26,080
so what can we do with godot

28
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:29,680
ah sorry

29
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:32,798
there is so

30
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,840
if you if you're not familiar with uh

31
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,479
you can see

32
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,439
the the game engine is both around the

33
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:41,039
scenes

34
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:44,320
so here we have the 2d platformer demo

35
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,439
for gadot i want it originally to show

36
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:48,398
the 3d one but

37
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:50,720
basically this computer is a potato so

38
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:54,479
it won't run

39
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:57,119
so you can see there is here in small

40
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:58,799
uh what we call the graph scene so

41
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:59,759
basically our scene is made of plenty of

42
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:03,360
nodes

43
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:05,680
uh for instance the player is the node

44
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,799
the the enemy or node platform and node

45
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,679
everything is not

46
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:10,479
so you can from here from here edit all

47
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:13,599
your thing

48
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:15,200
you can uh look from here yeah

49
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:17,280
the resolution is really small so you

50
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:19,920
can see anything but just trust me

51
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,040
you can edit plenty of things from your

52
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,200
game engine

53
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,319
and then when you're ready you can just

54
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:27,599
press one

55
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:30,238
one key and then you can start playing

56
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:30,959
you can start tweaking you can send like

57
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:33,360
this thing

58
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:34,480
on your mobile phone to debug remotely

59
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,879
etc so

60
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:38,720
there's plenty of things you can do uh

61
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:41,040
one really cool feature about goddard

62
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,840
is the the node i was talking to you

63
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,000
about

64
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,280
uh sorry i can't find my cursor here it

65
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,920
is uh the nodes

66
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:50,160
they are themselves scenes so you have

67
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:52,559
scenes listed inside scenes

68
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,519
so it's really cool because it means you

69
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,120
can

70
00:02:53,519 --> 00:03:00,640
just if i click here here it is you have

71
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:03,840
the scene of my my enemy for instance

72
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:06,159
which is here nice little guy

73
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,879
okay so you cannot see but it has its

74
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:08,879
own

75
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:10,239
sym tree and so you have plenty of

76
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:13,200
component like

77
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:14,879
for example this guy has a animation it

78
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:18,319
has a

79
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:22,000
sound emitter in order to do a special

80
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:24,958
specialized sound uh you have the

81
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,319
physical hitbox etc so you have all

82
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:29,280
those things uh

83
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:30,079
really put nicely together inside godot

84
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,280
and

85
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:36,720
each of those nodes you can plug them

86
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,680
script so try to click it's getting

87
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,159
harder

88
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:42,159
okay so you still can't see a thing and

89
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:43,040
i cannot zoom so sorry you have to trust

90
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:46,079
me

91
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,480
uh basically these things it kind of

92
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,319
look

93
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,720
from where you are it kind of looks like

94
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:52,560
a python it's not python it's a

95
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,000
language called a script language called

96
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,680
gd script it is

97
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:01,680
loosely loosely based on python

98
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:03,599
and from now on you may be wondering

99
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,599
why why this language why didn't they

100
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:06,159
they just took one existing language

101
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:08,480
like

102
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:09,280
buy some lua just a ship with the game

103
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,439
engine

104
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:14,319
it would have been much better or

105
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:16,000
according to uh the bug tracker of godot

106
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:17,918
there's plenty of people who think that

107
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,440
it would have been the best idea ever

108
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:22,560
and

109
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:25,840
yeah spoiler alert it's not the case

110
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,680
uh so yeah okay so the game engine is

111
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:31,758
great but

112
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,759
we're here for python right so

113
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:40,400
but before python just we should

114
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:42,400
just have a look at why gd script is in

115
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,479
fact a great id

116
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,638
and so to do that we have to just have a

117
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:47,919
look at how works the nodes i was

118
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:51,440
talking to you about

119
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:53,840
so goto is the c plus plus game engine

120
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:55,680
so every node is implemented just like a

121
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:59,599
regular c plus plus class

122
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:02,720
but you have a bit of additional stuff

123
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:04,639
which are those things and

124
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,240
so basically what you are what you are

125
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:08,240
doing by doing these things

126
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,880
is you are adding a runtime

127
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:13,919
introspection to your class

128
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:16,320
uh so what does it mean is uh you can

129
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:18,639
use your class like this so this is a

130
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:20,400
the c plus plus traditional boring way

131
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:21,360
just like you use your new keyword you

132
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,039
create a

133
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,199
an instance of your class and then you

134
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:28,560
just use it and you can use

135
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:30,720
the fancy dynamic way so it looks like

136
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,840
much more complicated it is it is much

137
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,960
slower but

138
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:36,320
it's cool because uh right now you can

139
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:39,198
see there is plenty of

140
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:40,479
variant thing and there is this class db

141
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:43,520
structure

142
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:45,840
class db is the component which remember

143
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,039
which register every uh every one of

144
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,799
your script

145
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:50,960
sorry not your script your node and all

146
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:53,280
its method all its property etc

147
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,080
so at run time you can ask hey class db

148
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:57,280
give me

149
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:58,639
uh the the way uh give me a new instance

150
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:02,239
of this uh

151
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:05,280
this node give me uh the

152
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:07,440
the the method for this uh this node

153
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,960
and then you can call things and uh you

154
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:11,840
can see uh you use

155
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:13,680
variant everywhere so when you call uh a

156
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,318
function you give parameters variant

157
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,960
you're

158
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:18,960
you you get back a variant and etc uh it

159
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,400
looks like a lot more a lot like uh

160
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,560
python in python

161
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,479
when you create a function there is no

162
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,960
typing it's dynamic typing so you can

163
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:28,800
give the function an int and tomorrow

164
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,280
you will give it a string and it will

165
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,840
work

166
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:33,280
or maybe it will blow up but blowing up

167
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,758
in python means

168
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:37,599
you get a nice error blowing up in c

169
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:40,880
plus means

170
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:44,639
anything people might get killed

171
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:47,680
so that's why variant is much better

172
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,160
because it means that you can take this

173
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,800
thing

174
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,560
and basically you can write it like this

175
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:55,919
and this is gd script

176
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:58,960
and so now this is very

177
00:06:55,919 --> 00:07:01,359
the same but it means now you have

178
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,400
you can have end user which write easy

179
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,840
gd script

180
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:07,120
and this code it won't crash if there is

181
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:10,318
a problem you will see

182
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:12,880
a nice error and etc

183
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:14,000
so put it another way we can cigarette

184
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:16,240
in two parts there is

185
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,720
the big the big main part which is the

186
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:21,919
core which contains this variant

187
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:23,199
structure which is a a combination of

188
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:24,960
all the bolting type

189
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:27,599
all the golden nuts that could be and

190
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:30,880
etc and you have this uh

191
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:34,080
this nice class classdb system

192
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:35,680
which allows you to to at runtime a

193
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:39,680
query

194
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:41,360
your your node method and property

195
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,720
and on the other side you have this

196
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,319
really small module

197
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,919
in the base is something really small

198
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:48,080
and it's it's not even in the core

199
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:49,919
of the engine and it's basically two

200
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,758
things one is the compiler

201
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:53,039
and another is the interpreter so

202
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:56,400
basically you just

203
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:59,199
compile your user readable gd script

204
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,080
into bytecode and then you just

205
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:02,319
interpret

206
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,280
one by call at a time and basically

207
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:06,319
you're doing

208
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:08,159
this one by caller time so

209
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,840
that's why gd script is a great idea

210
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:13,759
because it is really tightly

211
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:16,799
integrated into gadot and so yeah it

212
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:18,960
basically saying we should have

213
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,840
removed the gd script and use lua

214
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,919
instead

215
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,758
it means we have to fight against all

216
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:25,198
these things

217
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:26,879
but basically that's what i'm doing in

218
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:29,919
python

219
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:31,440
so it's it's painful but i really love

220
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:34,559
python because it has a huge

221
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:36,000
ecosystem and for instance

222
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:38,079
if you're like me and every time you

223
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,360
play a game you say oh the

224
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:42,080
ai of the this game is really poor maybe

225
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:46,240
one day

226
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:48,000
some guy will use this binding to use

227
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:50,080
to use machine learning to create a

228
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,720
really great ai

229
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,360
i hope so and so that's basically one

230
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,640
use case

231
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:58,320
you can use by bringing python together

232
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,680
basically you give a really huge

233
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:03,519
ecosystem nice

234
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:07,439
language and plenty of possibilities

235
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:10,480
now how to do that the

236
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,600
this is a basic um like every uh game

237
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,040
looks like this so

238
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,279
on the left side you have your god

239
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,160
binary so it's basically what you will

240
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:18,560
download from the

241
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:20,160
godot website and on the right side you

242
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:23,359
are you have all your assets

243
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:26,160
so you're like uh your sprite

244
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,560
so your script etc and what we are going

245
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:30,160
to do

246
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:32,399
is this so basically we just drop the

247
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,199
the gd script to replace it by python

248
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:35,760
and then you have

249
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,440
this shared library which will contain

250
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:39,760
the python interpreter so

251
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,560
it can talk to it can interpret your

252
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,720
python script

253
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,680
and now it has to talk to uh the main

254
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,720
goal of binary

255
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:49,599
so to do that there is this uh c

256
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:51,120
api which is called g native which

257
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,880
allows you to access basically

258
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:57,440
everything from godot

259
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:59,839
uh how this how this djignitive works

260
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,720
basically just like what i store what i

261
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:02,880
show you with the

262
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,720
variant stuff it looks pretty much the

263
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:07,680
same except

264
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:09,440
well you're from outside of godot you're

265
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:11,599
just like in shared library and

266
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:13,360
you can do that and it's much faster

267
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:16,160
than the variant stuff for

268
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:18,000
reasons we don't have to talk about and

269
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:21,040
so it's much more dangerous

270
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:24,560
uh anyway so what you have to do

271
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:27,599
to uh to give together

272
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:30,959
the python the python language

273
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:32,800
is um there is a function inside the

274
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:35,599
gd80 which allow you to

275
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,000
register a new script language inside

276
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:40,399
the

277
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:42,720
the game engine so once you've done that

278
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:44,000
godot will know that every time he has

279
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,079
to load a dot pi

280
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,160
file he has to call your library and so

281
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:49,599
you can do the work

282
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,600
and on top of that there is another

283
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:54,720
thing you have to do is uh

284
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:57,120
provide to the your python world all the

285
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,480
generative function because now you want

286
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,839
to access

287
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:05,279
all your nodes modify and node et cetera

288
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:06,399
now for how to do that first we use a

289
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:09,519
system

290
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:12,320
in truth i've used basically every

291
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:15,519
possible tool you can use to

292
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:17,040
plug python and see together

293
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:21,360
so if you have questions about this

294
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:24,560
after that you can talk to me i guess uh

295
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:27,120
i can say a lot about that but

296
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,599
anyway the best is saitam just kidding

297
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,600
there is

298
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,200
also cffi which is a really great but

299
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,360
for your use case site

300
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,640
is really cool uh if you don't know uh

301
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,959
satan basically

302
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,920
is a tool that's for you to compile

303
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:40,160
python

304
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,959
into a shared library which will be seen

305
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:43,519
from python

306
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:44,319
just like a regular module so this is

307
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:47,680
this gives you

308
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,480
like a 50 boost but the really really

309
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:52,239
great thing

310
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:54,560
is uh you can inside saitan

311
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,680
mix together c and python in a really

312
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:58,079
elegant way

313
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,880
so in the end it means you can go as

314
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:01,599
fast as c

315
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:02,560
and you can integrate really really

316
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:06,000
nicely with

317
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:07,279
external third party c library just like

318
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,639
what we need for godot

319
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:11,600
so it just worked great the the little

320
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:14,720
complicated thing

321
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:16,639
is basically we have plenty of templates

322
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:19,600
everywhere to generate this code

323
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:20,480
so for instance we have organo binary so

324
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:24,320
once again

325
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:26,959
we use class db to generate a json

326
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,800
which will show us all the class all the

327
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:31,518
methods the property etc

328
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,560
and then we can generate this file which

329
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:35,040
is basically

330
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:36,079
a site and version which allows you to

331
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:39,519
access every

332
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:42,239
class method etc so it's pretty big it's

333
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:42,240
6.3

334
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,480
megabytes but after that you have to

335
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,760
compile this

336
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:52,399
and saitam it because the site and

337
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:53,360
compiler starts by compiling your uh

338
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:57,519
your saturn code

339
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:59,600
into c and so now it's 87

340
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:02,320
megabyte and on top of that you're 60

341
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:05,680
seconds older

342
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:09,200
but it's only the beginning and so

343
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:12,479
compiling is 200 seconds and it's also

344
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:17,519
six gigabytes of ram on gcc

345
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:17,519
so this computer cannot do that so uh

346
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:23,360
travis cannot do that also so

347
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,720
you have to use clang which it will be

348
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:28,079
less ram

349
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:31,200
but gcc is great it's also great anyway

350
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:32,719
so that's what you end up with and there

351
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,800
is also template i won't talk to

352
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,920
to you about but you have templates

353
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,959
everywhere

354
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:39,599
and you end up with a nice thing um that

355
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:43,599
can

356
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,600
use python or you can use python

357
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:51,680
from this the basically i'm the

358
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:55,680
i've been doing this for like uh

359
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:57,760
since 2016. uh we are still in beta

360
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,959
this is a bit sad for me because i i've

361
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:02,720
gave a talk

362
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:03,359
about this like in the 2017 for euro

363
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,760
python

364
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:07,360
and the first bullet point was exactly

365
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:10,560
the same

366
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:14,160
so yeah shame but no because

367
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:17,119
this is not the same beta it's

368
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:18,160
much better better like before it was

369
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,000
leaking ram

370
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:22,639
now it's no longer the performance is

371
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,680
better i'm pretty confident we can

372
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:28,839
release something nice in a short time

373
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:30,319
so i'll promise we will have a stable

374
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:33,920
version

375
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:37,199
before star citizen for instance i hope

376
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:40,160
and after that if someone here

377
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:41,599
knows about mac os i'm not a mac os

378
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:43,279
developer and

379
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:46,800
there is a trouble with the build right

380
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:49,199
now so anyway i ask

381
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,639
and yeah one really important point i

382
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:53,920
think is uh

383
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:56,000
the possibility given all my system is

384
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:59,439
writing is written in cyto

385
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:02,639
it means we can provide

386
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:06,000
all the the godot api in cytom2

387
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:06,880
and we can make a user use satan so what

388
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,880
does it mean

389
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:13,199
is like uh first you just write your

390
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,800
your game in python like really fast you

391
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:16,240
can debug your stuff etc

392
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,839
and then when you need performance you

393
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:19,519
can slowly write

394
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:21,760
the hard path insight and to get

395
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:23,920
performance so it's like the best of the

396
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,959
whole world so i'm really excited about

397
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:27,680
it and

398
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:28,000
on top of that uh maybe you've seen that

399
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:31,758
the

400
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:34,639
godot 3.2 has been released

401
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:35,600
so now there is a 4.0 and there is

402
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:38,639
plenty of

403
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:41,360
compatibility breakage which are ongoing

404
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:43,920
for instance i was working on this

405
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:45,759
tonight and that's why i'm late

406
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:47,920
so there is plenty of light stuff coming

407
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:52,000
along performance boost and so on

408
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:53,519
so yeah i'm excited uh and yeah

409
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,600
you don't have to forget that it's a

410
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:57,440
game engine so i should be writing games

411
00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:09,839
but

412
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:09,839
yeah damn it and yeah that's it

413
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,920
so question anyone

414
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,560
no

415
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,440
okay so maybe uh maybe they already told

416
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,759
you but i will

417
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:27,839
told you again uh like monday and

418
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:29,360
tuesday there is a gotta come

419
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:30,959
and uh so if you're interested into

420
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:34,839
godot you should really go

421
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:38,800
and come and have fun with us

422
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:50,320
uh it's nice people are nice

423
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:50,880
and i'll be there uh yeah that's it oh

424
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,480
yeah

425
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:54,320
this is kind of a better question not

426
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:57,759
necessarily for me

427
00:16:54,320 --> 00:17:01,839
but what kind of help do you need

428
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:05,839
as you said that is

429
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:05,839
can you say some examples

430
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,919
yeah so the question is what kind of

431
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,559
help

432
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:12,559
do i need

433
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:20,160
first i need friend because uh yeah it's

434
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,240
kind of funny but it's like when you're

435
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,799
working alone on this kind of project

436
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,559
and it's

437
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:27,119
playing complexity so there's a lot of

438
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:29,120
people who come who look at the code

439
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:31,360
and they say oh it's nice i give a store

440
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:32,000
but they don't know how to what to do

441
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:34,559
what to work

442
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,120
so basically that just disappear and

443
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:36,399
when you're

444
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:38,159
developing this kind of thing you just

445
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,760
feel lonely and you have to work for

446
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:42,240
months and months and you're like oh

447
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:43,039
why i'm doing this anymore so just

448
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,280
people

449
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:46,320
coming and just adding an issue and

450
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,799
seeing oh

451
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:50,240
found something it's nice so this is the

452
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:52,240
first thing

453
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:55,760
and for instance if you want to make me

454
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:55,760
happy you should go to gadokan

455
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:03,039
on top of that i

456
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:04,320
think there is so as i said uh all the

457
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:06,000
the platform things

458
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,760
because there is a linux there is

459
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,840
windows there is macos

460
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:11,760
uh if you look at into the code base

461
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,959
there is plenty of sarcastic comments

462
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,960
about windows and

463
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,400
how complicated it is for basically

464
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:19,200
nothing

465
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,919
so if you want to make me feel happy

466
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,840
just

467
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:23,200
don't let me write sarcastic comments

468
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:26,480
about how mac os

469
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:27,200
is complicated and so on on top of that

470
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,240
there is for instance packaging

471
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:31,200
packaging

472
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,679
is like 90 of the work once you have

473
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,880
done

474
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:36,799
90 of the other work so this is another

475
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:39,120
stuff which is uh

476
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:41,520
not that complicated but plenty of small

477
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:43,360
thing which to add up

478
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,639
on top of that i think the code base

479
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,879
right now it's

480
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:48,080
about stable which was not the case like

481
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:51,039
two months ago so

482
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:51,918
people can come just have a look asking

483
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:54,080
questions

484
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:57,039
and uh yeah we might figure out what we

485
00:18:54,080 --> 00:19:11,520
can do

486
00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:11,520
thank you for the question
