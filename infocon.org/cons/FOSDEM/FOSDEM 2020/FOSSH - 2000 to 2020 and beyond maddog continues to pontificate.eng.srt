to a talk that i'm personally very

5
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:25,080
excited to see

hello ah there we go okay a little bit

11
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:03,760
high perhaps

12
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,760
we'll tune that down i know

13
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:08,720
but they said to me that they will take

14
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:12,158
care of that so i trust in them

15
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:15,280
okay hello everybody

16
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:18,720
it's nice to see you all here

17
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:21,920
my name is john mad dog hall or as i say

18
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:24,000
in china dingao

19
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,600
and i am the board chair of the linux

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,159
professional institute

21
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,360
we do certification of open source

22
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:33,119
professionals

23
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:35,039
and we try and move forward

24
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:36,560
the open source model we've been doing

25
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,920
that for 20 years

26
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:42,000
as of last year so this is our 21st year

27
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:45,200
we have 150 000

28
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,320
certified professionals in over 180

29
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,320
countries around the world

30
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:54,960
my talk is called fosage

31
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:57,039
and fosdem back and forth from the brink

32
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:59,439
of disaster

33
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:01,200
and uh i think as i go along i'll

34
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:01,600
explain a little bit about that title

35
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,719
and

36
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:06,399
why it's important first of all for the

37
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:10,079
people that don't know me

38
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:10,080
yes i am old

39
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:13,920
i've had three heart attacks i only work

40
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,360
with about 50

41
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:20,958
of my heart capacity the rest is dead

42
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,520
but that's okay because i am now the old

43
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:24,800
man

44
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:27,200
moving very slowly in front of you

45
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,840
the person i used to get mad at you know

46
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,440
get away

47
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:33,200
old man i am now him

48
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,120
if you see me going up and down stairs

49
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,440
please don't hurry me because that's as

50
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:40,160
fast as i go

51
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,599
but i've had a lot of different jobs in

52
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:45,040
the last

53
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:47,518
50 years that i've been in computers

54
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,840
and one of the things i'm most proud of

55
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:52,640
is that i am

56
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:55,040
pragmatic a couple of talks ago we had

57
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:58,319
some people stand up to say

58
00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:00,239
that it is wrong to belittle

59
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:01,518
people who are using proprietary

60
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:04,159
software and i am

61
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:06,239
happy to say i have never done that to

62
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:08,319
my knowledge

63
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:10,720
i uh recommend to people that they

64
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:13,518
should use free software

65
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:15,440
in fact i specify free software instead

66
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:17,519
of open source

67
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,440
and you'll see a little bit about that

68
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,840
later

69
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,840
thank you

70
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:29,840
but i'll give you a warning that this is

71
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,680
a highly opinionated talk

72
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:35,040
and if you wish to disagree with me we

73
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:38,319
can do it later over beer

74
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:41,920
so why the brink of disaster

75
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:44,000
i have seen over the last 50 years

76
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,200
things that are going along and

77
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,560
seemingly

78
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:52,159
at the very last minute and typically

79
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:55,760
from some very stubborn people

80
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:57,359
we have come back from disaster

81
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:00,480
and that's what a little bit of this

82
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:02,720
talk is about

83
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,920
now originally this talk was supposed to

84
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:07,599
be about the last

85
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:09,760
20 years and specifically about what

86
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:13,599
fossum had contributed

87
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:15,519
to the free and open source marketplace

88
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:17,440
and i was very happy to do that and then

89
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:20,079
i received this email from

90
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:22,639
stephen goodwin who is very nice guy

91
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:25,440
whose talk is following mine

92
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:27,360
and he says hi i think we're talking

93
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,280
about the same thing

94
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:32,240
so i met with steve we worked back and

95
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:34,000
forth and we came to a conclusion of

96
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,360
what i could talk about and what he

97
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,199
could talk about and i

98
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,639
highly recommend that you stay for his

99
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:41,040
talk and

100
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:42,000
uh and listen to that too and the second

101
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:45,199
thing that happened was

102
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,960
reality because if i

103
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:48,880
started to talk about all the things

104
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,320
that foster had done to the level that i

105
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,719
wanted to talk about them we would be

106
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:55,599
here until about midnight

107
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,960
and we wouldn't have time for beer so

108
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:00,160
that's the reality

109
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:02,960
and talking about just 20 years of stuff

110
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,440
that's like you know trying to leap as

111
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,758
fast

112
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:07,840
as far as you can without taking a run

113
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:10,160
you know it's a standing broad jump

114
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,599
as opposed to a running broad jump i'm

115
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,000
not going to demonstrate this because i

116
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,680
probably hurt myself

117
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,039
but that's what that's the way i feel

118
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,880
about it so

119
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:21,520
we're going to take a look in the past

120
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:23,520
with the knowledge of the presence

121
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,960
and we're going to do what we should be

122
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,960
doing a lot of times but sometimes we're

123
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:29,280
just too busy

124
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:31,758
and i'm going to try and show you how we

125
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:34,400
have to be very careful in the future

126
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:36,479
because we may not come back from the

127
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,400
brink of disaster

128
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:39,919
so let's go back into the long past and

129
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,039
i'll try and make this brief because

130
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:43,120
once upon a time

131
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:44,400
copyright and patents did not apply to

132
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,240
software

133
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:49,440
when people put out software there was

134
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:52,479
no license to protect it

135
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:54,800
we did this under contract law

136
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:56,719
we would talk to our customers and we

137
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,080
would meet with their lawyers and our

138
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,199
lawyers would meet with their lawyers

139
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:02,000
and we would have

140
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:03,520
a contract drawn up that said where you

141
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,199
could put the software on how many

142
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:07,758
machines you put the software how many

143
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:09,360
people could use it so forth and so on

144
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:12,160
and a lot of times the software was

145
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:14,479
distributed in source code form

146
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,759
because it wasn't enough of one type of

147
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:19,360
computer

148
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:21,840
to justify making it into a binary

149
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,840
distribution

150
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:26,080
and the other thing that happened back

151
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,440
in those days is when you bought say an

152
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:30,960
ibm mainframe

153
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:35,039
well it came with the operating system

154
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:36,000
and there was no real contractor said

155
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:38,159
that it just

156
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,840
did because you couldn't use the

157
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,160
computer really without

158
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,520
the operating system and everybody

159
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:47,120
seemed to be happy with that

160
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:49,359
until one day a gentleman by the name of

161
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,919
george and all

162
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:54,800
created a computer that was completely

163
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:57,039
compatible with the ibm 360 and nobody

164
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,720
ever believed that that could happen

165
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:00,400
and people could take their ibm

166
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,160
operating system and put it on the

167
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,960
amdahl computer and it was perfectly

168
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:06,479
happy

169
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:09,198
except for ibm they were not happy

170
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:10,000
and and actually the andal was a great

171
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:12,880
system because

172
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,240
the ibm systems were still water cooled

173
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:16,560
and so you needed to put

174
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,720
pipes and water and stuff and the mdol

175
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,599
was air-cooled you didn't need all of

176
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,560
that

177
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:24,400
the ibm had lots of lights and switches

178
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,319
and stuff like that on it to control it

179
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,000
and the amdahl just had this very large

180
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:30,000
crt screen

181
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,120
that if you toggle the switches right it

182
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,360
would actually put

183
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,360
a picture of the lights up on the screen

184
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:38,240
and it was really cool

185
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:40,080
and so and it was cheaper too and so

186
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,680
everybody started buying the amdahl but

187
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,359
not everybody but a lot of people

188
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,680
started buying the mdol

189
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,879
and putting the ibm operating system on

190
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:50,400
it and they were

191
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:54,000
ibm was suitably distressed

192
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:57,520
and so out of that came a kind of a

193
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,960
legal issue of you need to unbundle your

194
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:02,000
system software

195
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:03,599
from your hardware and allow people to

196
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,319
buy it as a separate line

197
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:07,520
item and this kind of started this whole

198
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,759
thing of

199
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:12,878
here's here's the software here's the

200
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:14,479
hardware and never the twain should meet

201
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:16,080
now another thing that came out of the

202
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:18,240
long past and this really

203
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,840
this really amused me a few years ago

204
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,440
when everybody started talking about

205
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:24,239
virtual machines

206
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:25,440
and vmware came out and virtualization

207
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,360
came every place

208
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:32,080
i hate to tell you this folks but i was

209
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:35,680
using this all the way back in 1968

210
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:37,919
because there was a software called cp67

211
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:40,880
and it was a virtual machine that ran on

212
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:43,598
top of the ibm system

213
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:45,680
and you could just stop your program or

214
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:47,920
write on any instruction you wanted to

215
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,599
you could kind of like store it away and

216
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:51,199
come back the next day and start it up

217
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:55,760
from that instruction again

218
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:58,959
it was sweet and it was called cp67

219
00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:00,880
originally but then ibm's marketing

220
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:01,518
people got to it and they just renamed

221
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:04,959
it into

222
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:06,880
vm and the little operating system that

223
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:07,680
ran on top of this virtual machine was

224
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,160
called the

225
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,439
cambridge monitor system because it came

226
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:14,399
out of ibm's

227
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:16,160
cambridge research facilities and the

228
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:19,440
marketing people renamed that the

229
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:23,360
conversational monitor system

230
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:28,160
and that became cms so vmcms

231
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:30,959
was really used as long ago as 1968.

232
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:32,959
likewise when people talked about you

233
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:34,399
know containers and stuff like that i

234
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:36,880
said i seem to remember this thing

235
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:40,640
called change root

236
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:43,360
and it was i was using it at 1979.

237
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,839
you know now granted you know containers

238
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,680
and stuff

239
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:48,000
are much advanced and everything and

240
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:49,199
it's not the same functionality but

241
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,560
you know there's a whole bunch of us

242
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,560
that just went around going okay

243
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:57,760
and softly right software copyright and

244
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,760
patents

245
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:01,680
really started to be applied in the

246
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:03,600
early 1980s

247
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,839
and the thing that started to apply that

248
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:08,320
was actually games

249
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:10,000
and you could build a game and in the

250
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:12,560
game became this little rom that would

251
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,600
actually hold the logic of the game

252
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:16,640
and people were making clones of those

253
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,480
games

254
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:20,079
and they would clone the hardware fairly

255
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,880
well but they didn't want to do all the

256
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:25,839
work of creating the actual software

257
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:27,920
so they would just copy the rom the ones

258
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:31,360
and zeros inside the rom

259
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:32,240
and that was you know that was the way

260
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,079
they did it

261
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,680
and of course the game manufacturers to

262
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:38,719
put all the work and sweat

263
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:40,399
into generating those roms were upset

264
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:43,200
about that

265
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:44,560
and they applied to say we should be

266
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:48,079
able to copyright

267
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:50,800
those roms and then later on

268
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:51,920
patent other ideas in software and stuff

269
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,560
and the courts

270
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:56,000
agreed with that and kind of out of that

271
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:58,160
type of licensing

272
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,480
and the fact that these systems were

273
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,600
being manufactured in larger and larger

274
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,839
quantities

275
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,760
came the concept of the shrink wrap

276
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:08,000
software license

277
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,360
and the fact that when you opened up the

278
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,920
package you accepted

279
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:14,079
whatever abominable terms were in those

280
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:17,519
tiny little smudge-like

281
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:19,279
writings of them and of course there's a

282
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:21,680
whole bunch of people who objected to

283
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:25,040
this one of those was richard stallman

284
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:26,959
created the free software movement

285
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:28,560
but in a lot of ways the free software

286
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:29,359
movement already existed there were

287
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,760
people who

288
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,399
exchanged software you know worked

289
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,959
together

290
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:36,959
with source code back and forth this was

291
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:40,319
nothing new

292
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:43,599
in fact it was proprietary software

293
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:46,160
that was the new thing on the block the

294
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:49,440
free software was just a continuation of

295
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:52,079
something that already existed

296
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,839
and you know of course you're aware of

297
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:55,839
the fact that richard stallman wanted to

298
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:57,760
create the entire operating system that

299
00:11:55,839 --> 00:12:01,279
he called gnu

300
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:05,200
and in 1985 he created a free software

301
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:09,279
foundation now here's the first

302
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:10,639
brick of disaster thing what if he had

303
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:13,839
said simply

304
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:16,399
it's not the free software foundation

305
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:17,279
but it's the free dumb software

306
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:20,000
foundation

307
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:21,200
just think about how much easier that

308
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,839
would have made it on

309
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:25,839
all of us

310
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:34,320
that tiny little slip that tiny little

311
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:36,959
mistake

312
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:39,440
made it so oh no no soft believers

313
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:41,040
software libra you know and all this

314
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:43,760
stuff and oh it's first

315
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,319
free software i don't have to pay for it

316
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:47,439
no it's

317
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:50,480
freedom software idiot

318
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:53,760
that's the most important thing

319
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:58,240
and then he invented the gpl which

320
00:12:53,760 --> 00:13:01,120
people laughingly called copy left

321
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:02,800
now richard and i disagree on a couple

322
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:06,320
things

323
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:06,880
what yeah we one do the things we

324
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,600
different

325
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:12,160
disagree on is the concept of is there

326
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:14,959
intellectual property

327
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:16,719
and i personally believe that there is

328
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:18,880
intellectual property

329
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,800
i believe that when you write something

330
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:23,279
or you create something or you do

331
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,930
something that you should have the right

332
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:26,240
to say what happens to that

333
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:28,479
[Music]

334
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:30,240
and that you should be able to protect

335
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:32,560
that intellectual property

336
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:35,279
either through copyright or patent or

337
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:38,479
some other legal means

338
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:40,160
and you know and because without

339
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:42,639
copyright

340
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:44,639
then every single license you generate

341
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:47,360
actually has no meaning whatsoever

342
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:50,320
because without copyright your software

343
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:53,360
is in the public domain

344
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:55,760
and so richard would continually bad

345
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:57,920
mouth the concept of copyright

346
00:13:55,760 --> 00:14:00,000
and i would say well richard if you

347
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:03,839
didn't have copyright then your license

348
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,839
wouldn't make any difference

349
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:11,119
but i consider that a small thing really

350
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:12,000
it did create some friction between us

351
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,600
and

352
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,600
and then of course we also had all the

353
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,680
non-free software that was coming up

354
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,760
it's cpm and people never talk about

355
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:23,680
poor cpm anymore

356
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:27,199
but cpm was my real exposure to the

357
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:30,239
bizarre world of shrink wrap software

358
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:32,479
and ms dawson at apple company

359
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,519
and other proprietary systems and we

360
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,560
don't talk about those

361
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:40,240
that much anymore either mvs vms

362
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:42,959
hbux i mean all the proprietary

363
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,680
operating systems and unix systems some

364
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:48,160
of which

365
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:50,719
did work around standards

366
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,839
now i want to say one thing about

367
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:55,360
standards and

368
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:57,600
and ken olsen who is the president of

369
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:59,360
digital equipment corporation famously

370
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,199
said one time

371
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:03,360
standards are as interesting as a

372
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:05,359
russian truck

373
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,880
and the press dragged him over the

374
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,240
kohl's for that

375
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,839
and i thought that that was rather

376
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,519
bizarre that he would say that because

377
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:16,160
digital spent a huge

378
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:17,680
amount of money in standards work

379
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,279
in working with people to create

380
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:21,279
standards

381
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:23,519
and when i finally caught ken one day

382
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:26,800
and i asked him about that i said

383
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:29,680
ken why did you say that he goes oh

384
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:31,279
he says that's just a personal thing i'm

385
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:33,758
an engineer

386
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:35,040
he says and you know i have to work on a

387
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:37,199
standards body

388
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,319
and those nitpicky little standards

389
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:40,479
people they

390
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:42,079
pick on this and they pick on that and i

391
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:45,519
hate that stuff

392
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:46,239
but once the standard is created it's my

393
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:49,040
job to

394
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:51,440
implement software to that standard to

395
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:53,439
make it fast to make it small to make it

396
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:56,399
robust to make it secure

397
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:57,839
that's what i like doing and i said

398
00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:01,199
thank you sir

399
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:01,600
thank you for clarifying that and that's

400
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:04,479
what

401
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:06,399
standards are really about because if we

402
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,320
didn't have standards

403
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:10,560
the pipes in your buildings wouldn't fit

404
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:12,880
together and the electrical components

405
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:16,560
in your computers wouldn't work

406
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,560
the standards are very important

407
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:20,800
open source and free software start to

408
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,519
come about

409
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:26,079
and projects that no longer exist like

410
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:27,519
mit's project athena which gave us the x

411
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:30,800
window system

412
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:33,120
and kerberos for network security

413
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:34,240
bsd which fortunately does still exist

414
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:37,120
but it's not just

415
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,920
bsd the operating system itself it's

416
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,959
interesting

417
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:43,360
that the term bsd is not just unix

418
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:45,518
it's the berkeley software distribution

419
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:48,959
and they created a lot of software

420
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:53,440
other than just unix that

421
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:55,439
they distributed i had a pi dp11 with me

422
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,639
at the lpi booth this week and people

423
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,399
came along and

424
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:59,920
started talking about it and then we got

425
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:02,480
to talk about bsd

426
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:04,000
and and all of the work that went into

427
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,720
that in the history of it it was

428
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,319
wonderful people think it's weird you

429
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:11,280
know they say hey mad dog you're

430
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:13,119
you're a linux person and i am a linux

431
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,480
person but before that i was a unix

432
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:16,958
person

433
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:18,720
and i worked with bsd and other unix

434
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:21,039
systems

435
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:23,760
and the other software that we hardly

436
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:27,359
ever talk about software like send mail

437
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:28,240
exvi and software that came from the bsd

438
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:31,439
distribution

439
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:34,960
and passed out onto other

440
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:37,360
distributions of other operating systems

441
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,960
in fact i point out to people that if

442
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,479
richard stallman

443
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,640
when he started the free software

444
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,280
foundation had concentrated on the

445
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,919
kernel

446
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:47,440
first he might have worked with that

447
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:49,120
kernel for two or three years

448
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:51,760
at the end of that development they

449
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:53,840
would have no applications for it

450
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:56,559
by the time the applications came around

451
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:59,840
that kernel would be useless

452
00:17:56,559 --> 00:18:02,080
so instead he concentrated on

453
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:03,840
applications that run across

454
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:05,520
different operating systems and

455
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:08,639
compilers that went across

456
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:11,120
different hardware platforms

457
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:13,280
to make it so that people like you could

458
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:14,799
develop applications

459
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:18,000
they were widely available to the

460
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:18,000
greatest number of people

461
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:23,039
and out of that creation of that

462
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:25,760
software

463
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:27,440
there was lots of little companies that

464
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,799
all of a sudden came into existence

465
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:32,640
companies we may not

466
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:34,639
remember anymore but the ingress company

467
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,400
that supported the ingress database

468
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:38,000
engine that started at the university of

469
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,919
california berkeley by michael

470
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,720
stonebreaker

471
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:45,200
and michael left the university and went

472
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:48,080
and formed a company that gave support

473
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:49,120
to the ingress system and ingrid still

474
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,720
state is free

475
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:53,039
you could still pull the university

476
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:55,440
english system down and use it

477
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:56,160
but if you wanted to get support you

478
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:59,200
could get it

479
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,520
from a stone breaker's company out of

480
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,080
that

481
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:04,240
eventually was postgres michael went

482
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:06,480
back to the university again

483
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,840
started the postgres program and the

484
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:12,000
same thing happened

485
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:16,000
very good free software mechanism

486
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:19,360
cygnus who took the gnu compilers

487
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:21,520
and created a support system

488
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:23,360
cygnus was great i loved the company

489
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:26,240
because the board of directors would

490
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:28,080
meet at a hot tub out in palo alto

491
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:30,799
you know to to have board meetings i'd

492
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:33,918
like that type of a company

493
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:35,679
matt we have to do that sometime

494
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:38,400
and it's companies like prime time

495
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:39,440
software and walnut creek and another

496
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:43,440
little company called

497
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:46,320
young minds who distributed software

498
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:47,760
now here's another edge of disaster

499
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:50,480
story

500
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:52,720
because once upon a time software was

501
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:54,640
distributed on magnetic tape

502
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:56,480
the tape drives were pretty expensive

503
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:59,600
the tapes were expensive

504
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:02,320
i remember a tk 50 tape from

505
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:03,439
digital equipment corporation was 100 us

506
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:08,639
dollars

507
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:13,520
back in 19 uh 1989 100 us dollars

508
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:16,720
and it held 95 megabytes of data

509
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:18,240
and because it was a tape and because it

510
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:20,320
was linear

511
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:23,360
you couldn't really have something like

512
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:26,639
a live file system on it

513
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:27,678
and i at digital wanted to see software

514
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:31,280
distributed on

515
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:33,039
cd-rom and i had a lot of my management

516
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:37,918
laugh at me because cd roms oh

517
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:40,960
those are for the music stuff yeah music

518
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:43,280
and uh so i said no no i think that

519
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:45,440
we should put digital data on there too

520
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:49,200
your computer data

521
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:50,240
so uh the standards bodies were working

522
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:53,200
towards a standard

523
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:54,400
neckbase standard for the placement of

524
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:57,440
the file system

525
00:20:54,400 --> 00:21:00,640
on a cd-rom

526
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:02,880
and one day i got a call from a guy at a

527
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:04,720
company called young minds he said

528
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:06,400
mad dog we have a problem i said what's

529
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:08,159
the problem he says well the standard

530
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:11,200
for cd-roms

531
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:13,520
is going to allow for four levels of

532
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:16,000
directory structure

533
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:18,158
and file names that would have eight

534
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,640
characters before the dot and three

535
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:25,360
characters after the dot

536
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:27,600
and no symbolic links i said really

537
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:29,039
that's kind of bad for eunuchs isn't it

538
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,959
he says yes

539
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:32,879
he says the reason that standard is

540
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:34,400
coming though is because the two major

541
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:37,520
drivers of that standard

542
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:40,799
are dex vms system

543
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:42,799
which by the way used file file names of

544
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:46,320
eight characters and three

545
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:50,080
and microsoft with ms-dos

546
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:51,918
i said i see the problem i said uh he

547
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:53,678
says we have a fix for this it's called

548
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:55,360
the rockridge standards but they're not

549
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:57,120
going to put those they're up there

550
00:21:55,360 --> 00:22:00,399
optional standards they're not going to

551
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:02,719
put those into the ecma standard

552
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:04,400
and i said oh well well who's working on

553
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:07,760
this who can i contact he says

554
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:09,440
there's a guy at deck who's the editor

555
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:13,039
of the standard

556
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:14,720
i said really what's his name

557
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:16,559
and he told me the person's name and i

558
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:18,400
said that guy only sets a cubicle away

559
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:20,960
from me

560
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:26,159
i'll go have a talk with him and to make

561
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:29,679
a long story short i blackmailed him

562
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:29,679
into putting those standards in

563
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:41,199
as a side note and a somewhat sadder

564
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:43,440
note

565
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:45,600
an engineer a young engineer was working

566
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:48,559
with me to implement

567
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:50,959
those those extensions in one of our

568
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:54,000
distributions of unix

569
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:56,640
and we had to trick our management into

570
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,320
letting us put that in one of our

571
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:00,559
releases

572
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:01,520
and that engineer was a very great

573
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:04,320
engineer who

574
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:06,080
unfortunately died at a very early age

575
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:08,720
the age of 30.

576
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:10,480
his name was paul shaughnessy and it's

577
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:14,320
because of paul shaughnessy

578
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:18,240
that digital got an early distribution

579
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:22,080
of the ecmas standard iso 9660

580
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:25,280
with the rockridge extensions

581
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:28,559
so you know and then

582
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:31,600
as time went on there was lots of

583
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:33,200
almost there solutions this berkeley

584
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:35,439
software distribution

585
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:37,039
created us a different distribution than

586
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:40,000
a t and t

587
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:42,158
now why did a lot of the different

588
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:45,760
companies like sun microsystems

589
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:47,520
digital hewlett packard

590
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:49,600
all decide to use the berkeley

591
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:52,720
distribution instead of

592
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:54,639
the att distribution

593
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:56,000
well for one thing the berkeley

594
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:59,039
distribution had

595
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:03,120
demand page virtual memory

596
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:06,400
and the att distribution of that time

597
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:08,559
only had a swapping system

598
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:10,640
the berkeley system had the fast file

599
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:13,279
system from berkeley

600
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:14,880
and the system five system still had a

601
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:18,240
rather weak and miserable

602
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:19,120
file system there i mean things changed

603
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,039
it got better

604
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:22,239
but at that time at the time a decision

605
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:25,600
was being made

606
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:28,559
these are the decision factors so

607
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:31,520
a lot of the companies went with a

608
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:34,320
berkeley distribution at that point

609
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:36,639
and then sometime later on as example

610
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:38,960
sun microsystems went from sun os that

611
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:42,000
was based on berkeley

612
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:44,320
to slowlaris that was based on system

613
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,320
five

614
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:49,200
now to be fair to be fair the system

615
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:52,000
five code

616
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:53,520
at that point was mostly a research type

617
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,080
of system

618
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:57,918
and therefore was never really tuned to

619
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:59,918
be efficient

620
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:01,200
versus the sun engineers have spent a

621
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:04,720
huge amount of time

622
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:07,039
tuning sun os to be even more

623
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:08,159
efficient than it was from the berkeley

624
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:10,640
people

625
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:12,640
and when they got the source code for

626
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:17,279
system five

627
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:19,600
they went oh my god this is terrible

628
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:22,080
but their management pushed them to put

629
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:23,120
it out and so i called that release the

630
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:26,639
sun os

631
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:31,520
to solaris i think it was solaris 3.

632
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:31,520
i called that the all pain no gain port

633
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:36,000
another thing that happened about that

634
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:39,279
time was a suit

635
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:41,279
against bsdi because there's this little

636
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:44,880
company that said hey we can give you

637
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:45,520
an entire unix system with the source

638
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:48,559
code

639
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:50,720
for a thousand dollars per machine

640
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:52,240
and this was a really great deal because

641
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:55,159
if you were the source code

642
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:56,320
from a t the license at that time was

643
00:25:55,159 --> 00:25:59,679
160

644
00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:02,480
thousand dollars per machine

645
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:04,000
well that wasn't the worst part the

646
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,679
worst part was

647
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,039
that you had to tell them the serial

648
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:09,600
number of the machine

649
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:11,120
that you were going to put the code on

650
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:14,320
now how many of you know the serial

651
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:14,320
number of your laptop

652
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:19,840
oh one person raised their hand that's

653
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:19,840
good the rest of you are slackers

654
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,320
and if that machine broke you had to

655
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:28,158
find the person at a t

656
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:29,678
who had he was giving out the licenses

657
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:30,720
and you had to tell them oh i'm taking

658
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:34,080
it off of

659
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:36,640
serial number and i'm putting it on

660
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:38,960
serial number before you can do that

661
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:41,039
that was a nasty thing to have to do

662
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:42,559
but bsdi didn't care about that you paid

663
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:45,039
him a thousand dollars here's the source

664
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:48,320
code put it on your machine

665
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:52,000
unfortunately a t took a little bit of

666
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:55,360
of you know being nasty about this

667
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:59,200
they sued bsdi and this became the first

668
00:26:55,360 --> 00:27:01,439
really horrible suit of a t

669
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:03,520
versus everybody else in the world with

670
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:06,880
eunuchs

671
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:09,039
and that dragged on forever and finally

672
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:10,880
it was settled in 1993

673
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:12,720
and when that was settled and with some

674
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:14,320
work by berkeley

675
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,679
because berkeley as soon as this started

676
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,320
to happen they said we're going to

677
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:17,840
rewrite

678
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:19,678
all the code there's not going to be a

679
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:22,158
single line of att

680
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:23,600
code left in our distribution and keith

681
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:27,520
mostick

682
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:30,639
no he should be sated okay keith bostick

683
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:32,080
led this effort and all the people and i

684
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:33,679
think it eventually came down and there

685
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:36,399
was only like

686
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:37,120
files that had anything that looked like

687
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:39,760
a t and t

688
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:40,639
code in it and he said oh that's easy we

689
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:44,559
rewrite the

690
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:48,080
17 files and uh and out of that

691
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:52,639
came bsd lite which generated netbsd

692
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:57,678
freebsd and then later on open bsd

693
00:27:52,640 --> 00:28:00,000
but even with that unix was losing

694
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:01,919
because all of the vendors all the major

695
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,880
vendors had seeded the desktop the

696
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:04,799
microsoft

697
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:06,480
the vendor said oh we'll sell server

698
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:08,799
systems

699
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:10,720
and then people could just use ms-dos on

700
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:14,879
the desktop and then it came along

701
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:16,640
windows nt and then all of a sudden

702
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:18,559
the vendor said oh my goodness they

703
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:22,480
don't want just the desktop they want

704
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:24,240
everything and that's when they started

705
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:26,399
to panic

706
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:28,799
and even tim o'reilly has stopped

707
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:30,399
selling unix books well maybe he's kept

708
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:32,158
selling them he didn't develop any new

709
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:34,879
ones he started developing

710
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:36,159
windows nt books and programming books

711
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:38,320
and stuff like that

712
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:39,279
because he said oh you know i have to

713
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:42,080
keep my

714
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:43,600
business alive i employ people i have to

715
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:44,080
keep them alive and i don't blame them

716
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:47,039
for that

717
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:50,480
because that's if you go bankrupt that's

718
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:51,840
the opposite of making profit

719
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:53,279
you know a lot of people in the freezer

720
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,240
i'm sorry a lot of people in the free

721
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:56,240
software space

722
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:58,640
they say oh they're charging money for

723
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:00,240
that as if that's a crime

724
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:03,279
even richard stallman says you should be

725
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:07,039
able to make money with free software

726
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:09,520
because the opposite of making money

727
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:12,480
is going bankrupt and then everybody

728
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:16,080
loses out

729
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:20,399
so that was a really bad part and then

730
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:23,760
along came this other thing

731
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:26,399
the linux kernel because

732
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:27,360
the new people had everything well not

733
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:29,520
everything

734
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:31,439
they had a lot of stuff and we took

735
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:33,679
stuff from berkeley we took stuff from

736
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:35,440
just the free software space in general

737
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:37,360
and we put it mashed it all together to

738
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:39,039
create these distributions

739
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:40,559
unfortunately some that are no longer

740
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:44,000
with us

741
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:46,559
soft landing systems iggrasil that's how

742
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,720
you say it by the way

743
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:51,600
debian fortunately debbie is still with

744
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:54,720
us red hat slackware and others

745
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:57,120
and a lot of other distributions

746
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:58,159
but the really thing that i that really

747
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:03,120
got to me

748
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:06,159
was the media love of lena's torvalds

749
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:08,799
and the free software movement and i

750
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:10,799
know that for a long time the bsd people

751
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:12,320
were really incensed about this because

752
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:14,879
they said hey

753
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:17,120
we have a better tcp stack we have

754
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:20,320
better this and better that

755
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:23,120
i would say yeah you probably do

756
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:24,799
you know but you guys have a demon as a

757
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:27,360
as an emblem we have a cute little

758
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:27,360
penguin

759
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,039
you guys you guys and i'm not i'm not

760
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:33,279
you know i

761
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:35,039
i've always looked scruffy so i no i'm

762
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:37,120
not a person to talk about this but hey

763
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:37,760
quite frankly a lot of the bsd people at

764
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:40,320
that time

765
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:43,120
had big beards and long hair and stuff

766
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:46,399
like that and then we had this nice

767
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:46,799
clean cut young man with sandy brown

768
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:50,080
hair

769
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:51,120
wire rim glasses that were wool socks

770
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:53,600
and sandals

771
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:54,239
and spoke with us lilting spoke perfect

772
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:59,360
english

773
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:59,360
with this lilting european accent hello

774
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:05,840
i am nina's two evolves and i pronounced

775
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:05,840
linux as linux

776
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:18,000
linux eventually left helsinki finland

777
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:19,360
and came to the united states to work

778
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,000
for transmedda and they called up

779
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:23,678
transmitter one day looking for him

780
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:27,600
and his voice on the other end of the

781
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:29,600
phone says hello this is linus

782
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:31,439
i said lead us that isn't even your name

783
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:34,959
because i know but nobody in california

784
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:34,960
could say lena so i'm linus

785
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:40,000
and that just endeared him to me because

786
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:41,519
there would be so many people that would

787
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,840
just spend the next hour on you

788
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:46,240
i'm leno's i'm lena's you know he didn't

789
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:48,000
care

790
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:49,440
you know he famously one time says i

791
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,559
don't care what you call the operating

792
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:54,559
system as long as you use it

793
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:56,240
so here's your chance bsd people you

794
00:31:54,559 --> 00:32:01,840
should just call

795
00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:01,840
lennox bsd

796
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:10,960
so linux version 1.0 came out in 1994

797
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:13,120
that's when i first

798
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:14,080
saw it really saw linux and understood

799
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:16,639
about it

800
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:18,720
and i met him and gave him an alpha

801
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:20,640
system so he could make it 64-bit

802
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:23,120
and also get the intel isms out of it

803
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:26,559
make it more portable

804
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:29,039
but from a unix standpoint it was still

805
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:30,600
a weak miserable system

806
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:32,080
because it didn't have symmetrical

807
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:35,039
multi-processing

808
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:35,600
it didn't have failover it didn't have

809
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:38,399
uh

810
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:41,199
it had a relatively fragile file system

811
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:43,600
you know all these different things

812
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:44,640
and so you know and but we had lots of

813
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:47,600
distributions

814
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:49,760
that kept going on all the time but the

815
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:53,360
other thing it didn't have

816
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:55,440
was applications i mean sure it had all

817
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:58,158
the little commands and stuff like that

818
00:32:55,440 --> 00:33:00,720
yes there were some you know other free

819
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:03,440
software that ran on top of it but

820
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:04,880
the type of commercial applications that

821
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:08,320
sells a distribution

822
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:10,559
or a computer system did not exist

823
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:12,559
so i brought out about five or six

824
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:14,399
different operating system hardware

825
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:15,440
combinations in my life commercial

826
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:17,039
systems

827
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:18,720
and the first thing you do is you really

828
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:20,399
you you release your system

829
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:21,760
and then you go out and you try and get

830
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:25,600
application

831
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:28,640
people to put their applications on it

832
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:30,879
and you go up to them and you say hi

833
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:32,799
i'd like mentor graphics i'll just use

834
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:34,240
them as an example mentor graphics would

835
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:37,760
you port

836
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:40,799
your code to our system

837
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:42,879
well i'm sorry you don't have the

838
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:45,760
compilers we need

839
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:48,480
you don't have the debuggers we need you

840
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:50,000
don't have this you don't have that

841
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:53,679
but then you say to them oh but we're

842
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:55,840
shipping 10 000 a day oh just kidding

843
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:57,919
it's running out of the lab we can have

844
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:59,678
it next week

845
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:01,840
because the only thing that gets an

846
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:05,039
application vendor to

847
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:06,720
port to your system is volume

848
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:09,280
they'll tell you all sorts of other

849
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:10,960
reasons but it's volume

850
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:12,720
and if you can say that we're going to

851
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:14,159
have millions of systems out there

852
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:15,918
they'll do the port no matter how

853
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:17,599
difficult it is

854
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:19,279
because they do the little calculation

855
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:20,399
of mine they're shipping a million

856
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:22,560
systems a month

857
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:23,520
i'll get five percent of those systems

858
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:27,279
oh my god

859
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:29,839
oh my heart be still that's lots of

860
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,839
systems

861
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:34,320
so applications or lack of them was one

862
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:37,280
of the problem

863
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:38,800
but we had this great thing happening

864
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,320
because there were this wonderful people

865
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:43,200
called

866
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:46,879
isps internet service providers

867
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:48,078
and they were already providing machines

868
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:50,639
and stuff for people to

869
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:52,240
log into with shell accounts and stuff

870
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:57,760
and these machines were almost

871
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:57,759
invariably based on spark and solaris

872
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,680
and they found out very quickly that for

873
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:03,920
about

874
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:04,879
30 percent of the price they could do

875
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:08,640
the same thing with

876
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:11,680
intel and linux and so

877
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:14,078
a big market of sun just went

878
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:15,279
out from underneath of them and then

879
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:18,880
along the way

880
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:22,079
there was this wonderful concept of lamp

881
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:31,839
linux apache mysql

882
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:31,839
and pearl or python whichever you wanted

883
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:38,640
i could have even thrown in pascal there

884
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:38,640
if you wanted to but

885
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:44,480
and it was a nice algorithm you lamp

886
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:46,240
everybody loves a lamp you go into a

887
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:48,000
dark room you turn into a lamp

888
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:49,598
you know you can't miss with that it's

889
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:52,800
marketing

890
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:54,880
it's all marketing right

891
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:57,040
and so thank you tim berner lee wherever

892
00:35:54,880 --> 00:36:00,480
you are for coming up with world wide

893
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:03,599
web because it was just great

894
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:04,960
and we found out that we could reuse old

895
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:08,400
systems

896
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:10,000
you know for more than just a doorstop

897
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:12,240
we could have it we could use them for

898
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:14,079
firewalls dns servers

899
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:17,919
all these things that we didn't want to

900
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:20,480
dedicate a newer more costly machine to

901
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:23,200
and so we you know when we take bringing

902
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:24,960
in 46s we could use the old 386s we

903
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:27,598
bring in 586s we

904
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:28,000
you know did the old 486s and people

905
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:31,280
liked

906
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:33,760
this they didn't like

907
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:35,680
a certain company in redmond washington

908
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:39,359
coming along and saying we realized

909
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:40,640
that 5 million people are still using xp

910
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:42,880
but we're not going to give you any

911
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:44,720
patches anymore

912
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:48,079
and if you have to you know and you have

913
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:51,598
to upgrade to windows 7 or windows 10

914
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:52,160
or windows 2000 or windows me or windows

915
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:54,880
u

916
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:56,560
or something like that in order to keep

917
00:36:54,880 --> 00:37:00,560
using your old hardware

918
00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:04,880
well j was it doesn't run on that either

919
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:07,599
and so you have a doorstop but

920
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:10,960
we could use this new linux system to

921
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:14,880
make use of those old systems

922
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:17,920
and speaking of reusing in 1995

923
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:20,839
a very interesting thing happened the

924
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:22,480
supercomputer market was going out of

925
00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:26,640
business tray

926
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:28,160
ecl cyber the cdc cybers

927
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:30,560
were all going out of business because

928
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:33,440
they would spend millions of dollars

929
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:34,078
in making these designing these new

930
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,680
machine

931
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:37,359
machines and then they would sell five

932
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:39,279
of them

933
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:40,880
one of them to the agencies that we did

934
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:44,000
not say their name

935
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:45,359
and you know who they are and then 40

936
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,280
universities that couldn't pay for them

937
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:48,720
anyway

938
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:50,880
and these companies were going out of

939
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:53,520
business and two people

940
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:54,800
dr thomas sterling and donald becker of

941
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:57,200
nasa

942
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:58,320
implemented this concept that became

943
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:01,680
known as beowulf

944
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:03,599
supercomputers i was somewhat distressed

945
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:05,839
today that at breakfast

946
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:07,760
i was talking about this and there was

947
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:10,400
somebody that didn't know what a beowulf

948
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:13,839
supercomputer was

949
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:16,160
be still my heart because these were

950
00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:20,160
great they could use commodity

951
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:23,920
systems to implement a distributed

952
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:25,040
cluster that could solve very important

953
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:28,560
problems

954
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:30,800
and probably the most important problem

955
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:33,000
and that and that includes today it's

956
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:34,160
even more important today than it was in

957
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:39,520
1995

958
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:42,879
is this problem called fluid dynamics

959
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:44,480
because fluid dynamics is every place

960
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:46,320
even with things that we don't think of

961
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:48,800
as being fluid i mean

962
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:50,240
this is we think of this as being solid

963
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:52,960
and it is

964
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:54,720
but the heat passing through this is

965
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:56,720
fluid

966
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:58,240
and we need to be able to track that

967
00:38:56,720 --> 00:39:01,439
heat water

968
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:03,439
air the environment everything is fluid

969
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:06,960
dynamics

970
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:10,960
and we need to solve these problems

971
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:14,640
and it gave them the ability to

972
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:16,240
solve these problems 40 times cheaper or

973
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:18,319
looking another way with the same amount

974
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:20,399
of money you could buy 40 times the

975
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:23,440
computing power

976
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:26,400
but the great thing about this for linux

977
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:28,480
was that most of these applications were

978
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:31,280
not something you bought in shrink wrap

979
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:32,880
down at the store how many of you gone

980
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:35,359
down to your pc store and

981
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:36,520
seen the box of super computer software

982
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:40,078
shrink wrapped up

983
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:43,359
29.95 does it

984
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:47,200
actually it did exist

985
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:50,400
red hat one time made a cd rom

986
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:53,919
they called it the extreme linux cd-rom

987
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:55,040
for rocket scientists and they

988
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:57,839
and they thought they were only going to

989
00:39:55,040 --> 00:40:00,960
sell like a hundred of these

990
00:39:57,839 --> 00:40:02,880
and they sold thousands of them

991
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:04,160
most of them were never taken out of the

992
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:06,240
shrink wrap

993
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:07,598
people just wanted to buy it and stick

994
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:09,200
it on the shelf so they could say they

995
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:12,880
had super computer software

996
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:13,680
on their shelf and today there are still

997
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:16,079
people

998
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:17,118
trying to make super computers out of

999
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:21,520
the raspberry pi

1000
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:23,200
zero never mind the fact that the poor

1001
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:25,680
raspberry pi zero is going to use

1002
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:26,720
all the cpu power just sending the data

1003
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:28,399
from one to the other

1004
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:31,520
and have nothing left over it actually

1005
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:31,520
solving the real problem

1006
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:41,599
in 1997 to 1999 it was a series of

1007
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:45,440
things that started to spring up

1008
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:48,079
slash dot source forge

1009
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:48,079
thinkgeek

1010
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:56,400
now here's here's a another

1011
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:59,359
almost disaster happened i had a friend

1012
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:02,480
of mine that was working for va systems

1013
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:04,319
and he told me he was just a and i could

1014
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:07,119
intern there

1015
00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:08,079
and he told me that he was thinking

1016
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:11,200
about going to

1017
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:13,839
west point oh dear

1018
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:14,480
i just saw 10 minutes left i'm on slide

1019
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:17,680
19

1020
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:17,680
of 157.

1021
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,200
he said he said i'm thinking about going

1022
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:22,560
to west point that's just well that's

1023
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:24,560
very nice but that's the

1024
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:26,319
thing in my mind this guy's going to go

1025
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:27,520
to west point it's going to end up in

1026
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:29,040
some military no

1027
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:30,880
actually it was the naval academy he's

1028
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:32,319
going to end up in some ship and he's

1029
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:34,000
going to be sunk and we're going to just

1030
00:41:32,319 --> 00:41:38,480
lose this great programmer and i

1031
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:40,000
said drew i don't think you should

1032
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:42,079
i think you give back over to your

1033
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:44,079
country by being a good free software

1034
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:47,440
developer

1035
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:48,960
than going to the naval academy

1036
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:51,200
and he thought about that for a little

1037
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:53,680
bit he decided not to go

1038
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:56,160
and it was drew's tribe who came up with

1039
00:41:53,680 --> 00:42:00,160
the concept for sourceforge

1040
00:41:56,160 --> 00:42:02,560
and implemented it so i am guilty

1041
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:03,598
of taking away a great naval officer on

1042
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:05,920
the other hand

1043
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:08,319
i am guilty of helping to give source

1044
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:08,319
forge

1045
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:17,759
in 1995 uh patrick de cruz from

1046
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:21,040
australia decided

1047
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:23,680
we needed a a a organization

1048
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:24,640
to try and promote the business side of

1049
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:27,520
linux

1050
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:29,680
and so he started linux international

1051
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:31,040
and the first president of that was alan

1052
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:32,879
feder

1053
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:34,960
after about six months alan said i need

1054
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:37,200
a job that pays real money so he

1055
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:38,480
left and i i took over i was being paid

1056
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:41,680
by dec

1057
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:44,319
and so i could do the job for free

1058
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:45,680
to help the linux community and one of

1059
00:42:44,319 --> 00:42:47,599
the first things we had to do was to

1060
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:48,000
protect the linux trademark from a guy

1061
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:51,440
named

1062
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:53,200
bill delacrossie in boston

1063
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:55,599
who had trademarked the term linux and

1064
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:58,000
was holding it for ransom

1065
00:42:55,599 --> 00:42:59,920
and so we jerked it away from him and

1066
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,680
gave it to lenas and created the linux

1067
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:03,200
mark institute to protect it for all

1068
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:05,118
time

1069
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:06,960
we also started the linux standard base

1070
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:08,560
project that was started by bruce

1071
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:10,400
parents

1072
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:13,040
after about a month people realized that

1073
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:16,000
bruce wasn't the person to lead that

1074
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:17,119
and jim zemlin actually took over and

1075
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,720
started to

1076
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:21,040
took the linux standard base project

1077
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:23,919
forward

1078
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:25,520
we realized we needed certification and

1079
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:27,359
we helped to promote two different

1080
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:29,759
certification methods one of them was

1081
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:32,720
ser and one of them was lpi

1082
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:34,800
sarah was a for-profit that combined

1083
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:36,720
teaching with the certification

1084
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:38,160
lpi said we feel that people should be

1085
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:40,240
able to get certificate

1086
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:42,720
teaching or education any way they want

1087
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:45,680
to we only do certification

1088
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:48,078
sarah eventually failed lpi went forward

1089
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:50,160
and is still going strong

1090
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:51,839
and we supported early linux marketing

1091
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:55,118
events

1092
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:57,119
in 1998 database support came in with

1093
00:43:55,119 --> 00:43:58,640
informix being the first database to

1094
00:43:57,119 --> 00:44:01,200
actually support linux

1095
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:02,000
and oracle coming about nine months

1096
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:04,240
later

1097
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,520
but they found out about the informix

1098
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:07,040
announcement and they

1099
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:09,200
hurried up their announcement two days

1100
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:13,119
before taking some of the wins

1101
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:16,879
out of informix war side events

1102
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:20,319
sun buys mysql 2008

1103
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:23,520
and then oracle by sun

1104
00:44:20,319 --> 00:44:27,119
yeah yeah okay

1105
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:29,839
in 1998 the open source

1106
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:30,640
term was coined i am one of the people

1107
00:44:29,839 --> 00:44:32,720
credited

1108
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:34,799
for the term open source it really

1109
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:36,000
wasn't me i was in on the meeting but i

1110
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:37,520
left to go to the bathroom

1111
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,680
and by the time i came back it was too

1112
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:41,680
late

1113
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:42,799
but it did recognize that all these

1114
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:44,960
different licenses

1115
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:47,119
some of which were competing with each

1116
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:50,880
other and incompatible with each other

1117
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:54,240
we needed to cut down on that and

1118
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:56,560
some people didn't like open source

1119
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:58,879
and there was one particular person that

1120
00:44:56,560 --> 00:45:02,240
didn't like the term free software

1121
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:05,119
because they considered the gpl a virus

1122
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:06,078
we'll see more about them later the

1123
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:08,800
dot-com boom

1124
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:10,560
really got underway in 1999 it burst in

1125
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:12,480
2000

1126
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:14,240
and a lot of the things that we love and

1127
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:17,440
deer were in danger

1128
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:18,160
of going away but they managed to

1129
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:21,359
survive

1130
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:23,200
right before the dot com bust

1131
00:45:21,359 --> 00:45:24,560
the ipo of red hat one of the most

1132
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:27,598
successful ipos

1133
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:31,040
of all time and va linux systems

1134
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:34,480
that was definitely successful as an ipo

1135
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:35,920
even though the president of the company

1136
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:38,079
admitted to me didn't really have a

1137
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:40,960
business plan

1138
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:43,119
sun microsystems became open and ibm

1139
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:45,440
invested a billion dollars

1140
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:46,480
in linux and the next year they

1141
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:48,560
recovered that

1142
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:50,480
which was a big shot in the arm for

1143
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:53,040
linux systems

1144
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:55,040
open source development labs osdl was

1145
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:57,520
created in 2000

1146
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:59,599
they were started to help developers get

1147
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:01,359
access to hardware because

1148
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:02,800
even though developers could have a pc

1149
00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:04,799
on their desk or something when you're

1150
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:07,760
trying to put an ibm mainframe

1151
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:08,560
underneath your desk it's difficult and

1152
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:11,119
they hired

1153
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:13,040
lena's toy vaults and paid him a salary

1154
00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:15,680
and he hired other people

1155
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:18,240
but unfortunately they were on the verge

1156
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:20,078
of bankruptcy in 2007

1157
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:22,078
they were reorganized as the linux

1158
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:24,240
foundation under jim zemlin

1159
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:25,760
and have been fairly successful since

1160
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:28,720
then

1161
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:29,520
of course fosdem was created in 2000 but

1162
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:31,598
it was actually

1163
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:33,200
austem at first and became foster the

1164
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:34,480
next year we'll hear more about that

1165
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:37,200
later

1166
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:38,560
and free and open source developers came

1167
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:40,160
in

1168
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:42,078
so these are some of the interesting

1169
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:46,078
events from the year 2000

1170
00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:49,440
to year 2020 embedded systems

1171
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:52,240
in the year 2000 linux became

1172
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:55,599
the most used operating system and

1173
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:58,720
embedded system design starts

1174
00:46:55,599 --> 00:47:00,560
why because up until that point

1175
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:03,680
everybody wrote their own operating

1176
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:05,759
system for embedded systems

1177
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:08,399
but then a very strange thing happened

1178
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:10,800
in 2000 the customer started to say

1179
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:12,240
i want my embedded system to talk to the

1180
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:14,160
internet

1181
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:15,439
or by the way i want to use all these

1182
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:18,078
little chips

1183
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:19,040
that are really neat and the embedded

1184
00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:22,880
system people said

1185
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:24,319
tcp stacks are hard security is even

1186
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:26,079
harder

1187
00:47:24,319 --> 00:47:27,839
and we don't support all those chips we

1188
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:29,599
only support one

1189
00:47:27,839 --> 00:47:32,480
oh my god there's this operating system

1190
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:36,800
called linux that does all this

1191
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:42,319
and so they went over to linux

1192
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:42,319
canopics came out september 30th 2000

1193
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:46,720
very interesting operating system it's a

1194
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:49,119
live operating system

1195
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:49,919
klaus is a very great guy really love

1196
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:53,599
him

1197
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:56,880
freebsd jails were in 2000

1198
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:58,319
because they could and so people started

1199
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:01,839
using freebsg

1200
00:47:58,319 --> 00:48:05,279
freebsd jails to be able to isolate

1201
00:48:01,839 --> 00:48:06,720
various pieces steve ballmer said that

1202
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:10,240
linux is a cancer

1203
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:10,240
june 1st 2001.

1204
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:18,480
in 2003 to 2007 there was a lawsuit

1205
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:20,319
of sco against linux and ibm

1206
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:22,240
very famous lawsuit how many people

1207
00:48:20,319 --> 00:48:25,520
remember that

1208
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:25,520
who doesn't remember that

1209
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:29,118
i want to take the time right here and

1210
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:32,240
right now to tell you

1211
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:35,200
that that was the evils go that did that

1212
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:36,399
that was actually caldera who had bought

1213
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:39,520
skull

1214
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:41,760
from the goods go guys

1215
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:43,759
and it was the evil school guys that did

1216
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:46,640
that the goods go guys

1217
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:48,160
were doug and larry michaels who started

1218
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:50,240
santa cruz operations

1219
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:51,598
created a really nice little unix

1220
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:55,359
distribution

1221
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:55,839
and they had did we were going to cells

1222
00:48:55,359 --> 00:48:58,880
go

1223
00:48:55,839 --> 00:48:59,839
and start a company called taratella and

1224
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:01,680
the reason

1225
00:48:59,839 --> 00:49:03,200
that i was telling you that these guys

1226
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:07,040
were good guys

1227
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:09,598
was because in 1997

1228
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:12,160
doug michaels insisted that lena's tour

1229
00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:15,359
vaults get a lifetime

1230
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:18,879
appreciation award in

1231
00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:21,200
at the tender age of 27

1232
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:23,359
i was 47 years old i hadn't got a

1233
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:26,078
lifetime appreciation award

1234
00:49:23,359 --> 00:49:28,880
and here's this guy getting a lifetime

1235
00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:32,000
appreciation award

1236
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:33,920
and doug insisted on taking

1237
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:35,440
lenas to breakfast the morning of the

1238
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:37,599
award and talking with him

1239
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:38,559
and afterwards lenas came back and i

1240
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:40,880
said linus

1241
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:42,720
what did he say to you leah says oh i

1242
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:59,839
was so embarrassed because

1243
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:59,839
he asked me how could sco help linux

1244
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:07,200
ubuntu started in 2004

1245
00:50:04,559 --> 00:50:10,160
creating great desktop distribution

1246
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:12,480
android started in 2008

1247
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:13,839
and then there was the vms coming out of

1248
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:16,960
different types kvm

1249
00:50:13,839 --> 00:50:18,078
zen and different ones and then the

1250
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:20,800
cloud

1251
00:50:18,079 --> 00:50:22,559
started coming and these are things that

1252
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:27,760
are just kind of interesting to me

1253
00:50:22,559 --> 00:50:29,839
okay the raspberry pi shipped in 2011

1254
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:30,880
and then we had containers of different

1255
00:50:29,839 --> 00:50:36,160
types show up

1256
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:39,520
docker and kubernetes and others

1257
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:41,440
i got interested in fpgas

1258
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:42,880
said if he if he wasn't going to start

1259
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:47,599
an operating system again

1260
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:50,319
he probably would start studying fpgas

1261
00:50:47,599 --> 00:50:52,960
and risk five i'm very interested in

1262
00:50:50,319 --> 00:50:52,960
risk five

1263
00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:57,280
about that time i had a friend working

1264
00:50:55,839 --> 00:50:58,319
for a consulting company his name was

1265
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:01,040
jonathan eunice

1266
00:50:58,319 --> 00:51:02,880
the company was called illuminata unlike

1267
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:06,558
a lot of

1268
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:08,079
people who are analysts jonathan was a

1269
00:51:06,559 --> 00:51:08,880
technical analyst he looked at the

1270
00:51:08,079 --> 00:51:10,880
technical

1271
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:13,040
abilities of different operating systems

1272
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:16,160
and he specialized in unix

1273
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:20,000
so we compare sun os to solaris

1274
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:21,759
to digital unix to alteryx to all these

1275
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,680
and i asked them when i first started

1276
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:25,520
working with linux i said jonathan what

1277
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:27,759
do you think of linux he says linux is a

1278
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:29,359
toy

1279
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:31,520
a couple years later i said what do you

1280
00:51:29,359 --> 00:51:34,160
think of linux he says linux is getting

1281
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:34,160
interesting

1282
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:38,960
i asked him a couple years later and

1283
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:40,879
says he says i recommend linux

1284
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:42,400
for non-critical applications to my

1285
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:45,599
customers

1286
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:48,000
and finally i was at a enterprise

1287
00:51:45,599 --> 00:51:49,359
uh meeting down in washington d.c with

1288
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:52,319
the government

1289
00:51:49,359 --> 00:51:54,240
education business and jonathan was a

1290
00:51:52,319 --> 00:51:55,759
keynote speaker and i got up at the end

1291
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:57,598
of his talk i said jonathan

1292
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:58,880
and i recited all these things he had

1293
00:51:57,599 --> 00:52:00,319
said to me in the past

1294
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:02,720
i said jonathan what do you think of

1295
00:52:00,319 --> 00:52:04,960
linux now he says

1296
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:05,759
i recommend it i recommend to all my

1297
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:08,319
customers

1298
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:10,400
that they at least consider it for every

1299
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:12,558
application

1300
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:14,319
that was a long way to come in just a

1301
00:52:12,559 --> 00:52:18,559
short time

1302
00:52:14,319 --> 00:52:21,040
but when i was leaving digital in 1999

1303
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:23,200
the day i was leaving my senior manager

1304
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:25,680
took me down to the cafeteria

1305
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:29,919
very quietly asked me the question when

1306
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:29,919
can i fire all my deck unix engineers

1307
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:35,040
when will linux have the functionality

1308
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:37,598
necessary to support our customers and i

1309
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:40,720
can migrate them off of digital unix

1310
00:52:37,599 --> 00:52:43,440
onto linux i told them

1311
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:47,040
that i couldn't give them the exact date

1312
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:50,559
but it was going to happen

1313
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:53,759
so why open open

1314
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:55,040
gives all of you people the ability to

1315
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:57,599
get the code

1316
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:58,800
and know that you can put it into your

1317
00:52:57,599 --> 00:53:02,720
products

1318
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:05,920
the things that you are making but

1319
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:09,598
most open licenses do not force you

1320
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:15,520
to give your changes to the end user

1321
00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:19,040
or even back to the open system

1322
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:20,720
why freedom software because freedom

1323
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:23,200
software gives you the same

1324
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:25,680
capabilities of getting the software and

1325
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:28,799
knowing what you can do with it

1326
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:32,319
but it also allows the end user to have

1327
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:36,160
access to those changes i have an

1328
00:53:32,319 --> 00:53:38,640
entire drawer full of calculators

1329
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:40,720
and small computers that i cannot use

1330
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:43,440
anymore

1331
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:44,160
because the software that went into them

1332
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:47,359
was not

1333
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:49,440
free software and people say well

1334
00:53:47,359 --> 00:53:52,319
most users don't have the expertise to

1335
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:54,000
fix it and that is true

1336
00:53:52,319 --> 00:53:56,000
but they don't have the they don't have

1337
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:58,880
the chance of fixing

1338
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:59,920
it they can't make the decision to make

1339
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:02,079
the investment

1340
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:03,280
to fix it they can't join with a group

1341
00:54:02,079 --> 00:54:06,079
of people if the

1342
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:07,440
hundred thousand xp users had gotten

1343
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:10,720
together with a group

1344
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:12,880
and said we want to fund patches to xp

1345
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:15,200
if they'd had the source code for xp

1346
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:16,960
they could have done that

1347
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:25,839
they might have been able to find one

1348
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:25,839
microsoft engineer that could code

1349
00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:32,720
and so what are the new challenges that

1350
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:36,160
we as a group have

1351
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:37,439
we have to decide who really owns free

1352
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:40,879
software

1353
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:43,839
do we own free software

1354
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:46,000
oh oh i'm sorry i went back do we own

1355
00:54:43,839 --> 00:54:47,680
free software to the company's own free

1356
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:50,000
software

1357
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:51,118
does the community own free software to

1358
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:53,839
end users

1359
00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:55,599
own free software or is it all of the

1360
00:54:53,839 --> 00:54:58,400
above

1361
00:54:55,599 --> 00:55:00,720
nobody owns free software because we all

1362
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:03,200
own free software

1363
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:03,759
and that is why i like free software

1364
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:08,160
over

1365
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:10,799
over open source and what worries me

1366
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:12,160
is that some companies who say they love

1367
00:55:10,799 --> 00:55:14,720
open source

1368
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:16,480
are creating closed solutions with open

1369
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:17,919
source

1370
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:19,760
and there's been a lot of people in this

1371
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:21,200
track who have talked about that today

1372
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:22,799
not just me

1373
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:25,279
and the other thing that worries me is

1374
00:55:22,799 --> 00:55:28,400
we have 95 percent of people who are now

1375
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:29,839
using open source and some that are

1376
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:33,200
using free software

1377
00:55:29,839 --> 00:55:34,720
that don't value that freedom and they

1378
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:36,640
don't care

1379
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:38,799
whether they have it or not and that's a

1380
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:41,040
problem

1381
00:55:38,799 --> 00:55:43,359
so we have new challenges and

1382
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:45,359
opportunities

1383
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:48,240
these are the major ones i think

1384
00:55:45,359 --> 00:55:52,558
security and privacy

1385
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:54,479
it's worse than most people understand

1386
00:55:52,559 --> 00:55:56,880
one of the reasons i'm interested in is

1387
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:58,960
five is because i want to create a

1388
00:55:56,880 --> 00:56:01,040
completely open ship with a completely

1389
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:02,960
open bios with completely open device

1390
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:04,960
drivers with completely open software

1391
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:07,359
with completely open applications

1392
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:10,640
chained with a chain of trust

1393
00:56:07,359 --> 00:56:12,240
up it and those processors you should be

1394
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:13,359
able to look at the mass for those

1395
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:16,240
processors

1396
00:56:13,359 --> 00:56:17,598
and be able to say yes this is free of

1397
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:20,799
trapdoors

1398
00:56:17,599 --> 00:56:20,799
it's free of malware

1399
00:56:21,359 --> 00:56:25,279
we should be able to have clouds in our

1400
00:56:23,359 --> 00:56:26,799
own home from the cloud software that if

1401
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:27,520
you want to use clouds from a company

1402
00:56:26,799 --> 00:56:28,799
you can but

1403
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:31,920
we should be able to use the same

1404
00:56:28,799 --> 00:56:35,839
software in our own homes

1405
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:38,400
we need ease of use that is so intense

1406
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:40,160
that even my mother and father should be

1407
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:42,559
able to use it

1408
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:44,078
i wrote a white paper in 1986 talking

1409
00:56:42,559 --> 00:56:47,040
about my mother and father

1410
00:56:44,079 --> 00:56:50,880
and electronic things if it had more

1411
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:53,599
than two buttons on it they were lost

1412
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:54,640
they would not be able to survive

1413
00:56:53,599 --> 00:56:58,400
without their tech

1414
00:56:54,640 --> 00:57:00,799
guy it's funny

1415
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:02,480
duvet torvalds every time she talks

1416
00:57:00,799 --> 00:57:05,920
about lena she calls him the i.t

1417
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:09,839
guy yesterday the i.t

1418
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:09,839
guy's father showed up here

1419
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:16,078
literally and uh it was nice to see him

1420
00:57:13,839 --> 00:57:16,078
again

1421
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:21,440
artificial intelligence all the people

1422
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:23,280
out there to talk about artificial

1423
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:24,160
intelligence please stop calling it that

1424
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:26,960
you should call it

1425
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:28,558
inorganic intelligence because there's

1426
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:31,680
nothing that is going to limit

1427
00:57:28,559 --> 00:57:33,599
artificial intelligence i believe in the

1428
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:35,279
alan turing model of artificial

1429
00:57:33,599 --> 00:57:38,640
intelligence that says that our brains

1430
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:42,640
are made up of synapses and neurons

1431
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:44,640
it's a chemical electrochemical reaction

1432
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:45,759
and if we could duplicate that with

1433
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:49,200
silicon

1434
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:51,440
we can have systems as

1435
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:54,879
intelligent as us and there's nothing

1436
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:57,920
that's going to stop that

1437
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:57,920
be very afraid

1438
00:57:59,119 --> 00:58:03,440
money versus the community one of the

1439
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:05,520
problems with free software is we

1440
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:06,960
typically don't generate enough money

1441
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:10,240
with free software to put

1442
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:10,240
lots of ads on tv

1443
00:58:10,319 --> 00:58:15,759
education with foss we're still not

1444
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:18,480
doing the right education

1445
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:20,079
i think i'm out of time but the fight is

1446
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:23,680
not over

1447
00:58:20,079 --> 00:58:26,400
we need to fight

1448
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:27,118
love is love i i got a problem with that

1449
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:29,599
last year

1450
00:58:27,119 --> 00:58:32,559
i'm not going to go into how you should

1451
00:58:29,599 --> 00:58:32,559
act in the shower

1452
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:38,640
but we should love free software

1453
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:41,839
and we should be aware that some

1454
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:43,839
entities that we're using free software

1455
00:58:41,839 --> 00:58:45,920
are now going back to proprietary

1456
00:58:43,839 --> 00:58:47,520
software

1457
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:49,280
but one of the things that drives me

1458
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:51,200
forward and i really love this

1459
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:52,559
and it's happened here i hope it

1460
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:54,000
continues to happen

1461
00:58:52,559 --> 00:58:56,480
it's when the people come up to me and

1462
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:59,599
say i listened to you 10 years ago

1463
00:58:56,480 --> 00:59:02,000
20 years ago 30 years ago 40 years ago

1464
00:58:59,599 --> 00:59:02,880
and now i own my own company or employ

1465
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,240
60 people

1466
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:06,559
or have created this free software

1467
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:11,359
project that 10 million people are using

1468
00:59:06,559 --> 00:59:14,880
is because i listen to you thank you

1469
00:59:11,359 --> 00:59:19,040
and now i say thank you

1470
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:33,839
thank you thank the people

1471
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:33,839
at foster

1472
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:52,240
you
