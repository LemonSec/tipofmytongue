1
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:09,280
that's good

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:11,759
so the next presentation is by mr falker

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,480
and he's going to talk about kd ikd

4
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:17,920
itinerary

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,920
so please give him a round of applause

6
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:25,920
over to you thank you

7
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:29,920
um yeah so i'm going to talk about

8
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:34,000
uh kd itinerary or digital traveler

9
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:37,920
assistants um what do we mean when we

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:41,280
when we say that you probably know um

11
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:43,120
services like tripit or

12
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,610
some of the travel assistance features

13
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,760
in google now

14
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:47,920
[Music]

15
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:50,718
they they all more or less work the same

16
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:54,320
right so they read your email

17
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:58,000
they find tickets boarding passes

18
00:00:54,320 --> 00:01:00,719
bookings that kind of stuff in there um

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,160
they put it into your calendar or they

20
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:06,080
create a nice

21
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:09,039
timeline and then guide you through that

22
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:11,200
um and give you real-time updates on

23
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:13,040
delays and that kind of stuff

24
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,360
all of that is available for free in the

25
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:18,479
sense that you don't pay for it

26
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:21,200
at least not by money but with your

27
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:21,200
with your data

28
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:28,000
and how bad is that um

29
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,880
so the the first thing that comes to

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,759
mind is like the

31
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:33,439
the data you directly uh leak to those

32
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:35,119
services right so

33
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:36,880
your name your birthday your credit card

34
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:41,680
number your passport number

35
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:44,158
that kind of stuff um

36
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:46,159
and maybe you're okay with that with

37
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:50,079
sharing that with those services

38
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:53,119
um but the thing people think less about

39
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:57,919
um is kind of the

40
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:57,920
indirectly leaked data um

41
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:03,439
so if um if you and i travel to

42
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:04,719
brussels on the first weekend in

43
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:07,119
february

44
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:09,119
um that might be pure coincidence right

45
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:11,760
but i guess

46
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:13,680
for many of us that isn't the first time

47
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:16,879
that has happened right

48
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:20,480
so two or three times same

49
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:22,079
destination same time that is no longer

50
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:24,238
a coincidence right so if you have

51
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:27,440
enough of that travel data

52
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:31,120
um that actually tells you a lot on

53
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,120
relations between people so

54
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:34,959
what you are interested in who you work

55
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,800
for

56
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:39,280
where your family lives all that kind of

57
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,280
stuff right

58
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:44,720
so in that point

59
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:46,480
giving your travel data to to someone

60
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:50,239
like google is not just

61
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:50,640
impacting yourself but everyone else as

62
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:53,760
well

63
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:57,679
so um

64
00:02:53,760 --> 00:03:01,200
not ideal what do we do about that

65
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,200
so one approach might be

66
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:07,679
let's just not use those services

67
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,599
and that works uh until you find

68
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,879
yourself traveling in a foreign country

69
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:12,480
where you don't speak any of the local

70
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:14,159
languages

71
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,518
and then get introduced to their

72
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:19,440
counterpart of shin

73
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:22,319
azvakir or tariffs

74
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:24,079
and then you really want some some

75
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:27,119
assistance right

76
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:29,680
um so that brings us to

77
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,879
another approach to deal with this if we

78
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,400
don't like something that

79
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:34,000
or if you don't like the available

80
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:38,640
options right

81
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,640
let's build one our own one on our own

82
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:45,119
so let's have a look at what this would

83
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:45,120
take

84
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:51,920
turns out the problem is actually

85
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:53,519
more about data rather than about code

86
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,439
there's also

87
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:56,720
quite some code necessary but a lot of

88
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:59,920
building blocks

89
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:01,840
already exist the main challenge seems

90
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:03,760
to be

91
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,360
getting the various pieces of data we

92
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:08,640
need

93
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:10,239
and i group this into in three general

94
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:13,279
categories

95
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:17,599
um first one is the

96
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,599
the personal data so that is

97
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:22,400
you booked a hotel or a train to a

98
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,960
specific location

99
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,239
um that data usually comes to you in the

100
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:29,840
form of

101
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,840
emails or pdf documents

102
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,639
or you find it on on a website

103
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,040
the second category of data is what i

104
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,080
would call the

105
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:46,000
static data so that was information

106
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:49,919
on where exactly is a specific airport

107
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,919
or in which time zone is that airport

108
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,040
i come from berlin so their airports are

109
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,479
actually static

110
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,880
in other parts of the world people

111
00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:01,919
apparently managed to build new airports

112
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,919
so static here

113
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:07,280
refers to kind of the release cycle of

114
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,160
the software right so

115
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:11,758
a few months at most so that is data

116
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,880
that is practical to

117
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:17,919
to ship for offline use

118
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,320
and the third category is what i would

119
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:20,530
call

120
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:22,800
dynamic data so

121
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:24,799
[Music]

122
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,160
delay information for example or gate

123
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:30,479
changes so

124
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:33,039
uh extremely short-lived uh information

125
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:35,680
that you need to query from some some

126
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:37,840
online service

127
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,639
so let's look at those three categories

128
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,638
in a bit more detail

129
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:45,680
fortunately we are not the first one

130
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,840
with

131
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,600
those specific problems right google

132
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:51,119
built the same system

133
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,840
and they also needed to get their hands

134
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,840
on those data

135
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,318
and the way google usually solves this

136
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:00,800
is

137
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:01,840
they define a standard and encourage

138
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,479
everyone else to

139
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:05,359
to follow that and that's what they did

140
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:08,880
for the

141
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:11,919
booking data they came up with the

142
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:13,440
schema.org data model which they also

143
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:15,919
use for the search engine but that

144
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,919
contains

145
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,800
like structured annotations that they

146
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:22,720
expect an email

147
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,080
about your your flight or your train and

148
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:27,919
so on

149
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:29,840
um depending on where you live

150
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:31,440
that seems to be present in about 30 to

151
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:34,400
50 percent of

152
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:37,120
booking related emails so that's a good

153
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,120
starting point

154
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:42,159
then of course you have random

155
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:44,230
unstructured emails so just

156
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,000
meant for human consumption

157
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:49,440
[Music]

158
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,280
that we have to deal with um then for

159
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:54,560
flights there is uh

160
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:58,638
apple uh wallet passes uh

161
00:06:54,560 --> 00:07:00,960
as something that is fairly uh popular

162
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:02,560
um and then there's barcodes so

163
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:05,919
backwards i can probably fill

164
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:08,000
an entire talk with um

165
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:09,599
on what you can extract from from that

166
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,599
as a

167
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:14,080
kind of structured information but not

168
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:15,599
meant for our purpose

169
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:17,599
but so that's at least something to work

170
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:21,280
with

171
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:21,759
uh for static data uh we also have quite

172
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,799
some

173
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:28,400
some stuff to work with uh

174
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:30,800
most prominently wiki data so that is

175
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:32,638
structured data of pretty much

176
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:36,479
everything imaginable

177
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:39,120
um and openstreetmap uh

178
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:40,000
covering the like the local specific

179
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,160
parts

180
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,039
and also the timezone maps so timezones

181
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,400
is something

182
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:46,400
really important for that use case

183
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,919
areas where we still have some some gaps

184
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:54,120
i would say

185
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:56,840
is adding

186
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:58,000
vendor-specific station identifiers to

187
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:00,400
wikidata

188
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,720
that is for example necessary to match

189
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:05,840
to barcode content

190
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:07,919
uh and then the whole problem of like

191
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:09,758
indoor navigation and navigation to your

192
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:13,680
specific seat on the train and

193
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:17,520
those kind of information

194
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:19,680
and for dynamic data again

195
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:21,599
google did some groundwork there they

196
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:25,840
defined the

197
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:27,759
gtfs standards as an interface for

198
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:32,319
public transport operators to

199
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:34,640
feed that information to to google maps

200
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:36,719
but many of them luckily do that as as

201
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:39,760
open data

202
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:40,719
so we can consume that by free software

203
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,799
as well

204
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:45,519
and there's two big free software

205
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:47,519
implementations of of such

206
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:48,720
journey querying services based on on

207
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:52,959
top of gtfs

208
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:56,240
that's navicia and open trip planner

209
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:57,839
um so that's uh

210
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:00,000
that's at least covering the the drain

211
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:02,160
and bus part

212
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,920
uh then we have the apple wallet

213
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,880
boarding passes again they also have a

214
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:08,560
built-in

215
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:11,439
update api that's useful for

216
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:13,680
for gate changes for example uh but that

217
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,560
has the disadvantage that it leaks user

218
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,880
information so

219
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,599
not ideal and then of course there's

220
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:20,880
plenty of

221
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:24,560
vendor-specific online apis

222
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:26,880
um many of them unfortunately not

223
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:28,399
really compatible with free software or

224
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,160
open data requirements

225
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:32,240
so you have some terms of conditions

226
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:34,319
that

227
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,600
aren't really compatible with our use

228
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,279
cases

229
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:40,160
or you need api keys that you're not

230
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:44,880
allowed to to publish right so

231
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:44,880
problems like this um

232
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:49,680
but that's the the theory so let's have

233
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:52,030
a look at what we have actually built

234
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:53,519
over the last two years

235
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:57,199
[Music]

236
00:09:53,519 --> 00:10:01,360
the first component is the

237
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:04,000
k itinerary data extraction library

238
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,680
so that implements this schema.org data

239
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,720
model for

240
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:11,199
flights trains buses hotels

241
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,200
events

242
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:17,199
and i'm forgetting one well basically

243
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:19,040
those are restaurant reservations that's

244
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,760
the other one

245
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,959
and it has an extraction system that can

246
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,640
handle the

247
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:27,199
structured data so if there's structured

248
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:28,640
annotations in emails it can consume

249
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:32,160
that

250
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:33,439
and it has an unstructured extraction

251
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:37,199
mechanism

252
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:40,959
both generically and it has support for

253
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:44,000
like vendor-specific scripts

254
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:45,680
so for i think a bit more than 50

255
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,120
vendors where we

256
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:49,359
very generic approaches or these

257
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,440
structured approaches don't work

258
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,120
you can write a small javascript that

259
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,320
does the extraction for that specific

260
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,320
render

261
00:10:54,320 --> 00:11:00,000
and that's then a few lines of regular

262
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:02,880
expressions or x-pass queries

263
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,839
output of that is then augmented by

264
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:09,040
informations we we draw from wiki data

265
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:10,000
so that's filling in time zones or geo

266
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:13,360
coordinates for

267
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,680
for stations and airports and that can

268
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:18,320
consume basically all the data formats

269
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:19,839
um in which you might get these

270
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:23,680
documents

271
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:25,360
um anything you find in an email pdf

272
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:27,120
the apple wallet boarding passes and so

273
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:31,440
on

274
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:34,640
um if you if any one of you has seen

275
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:36,480
um the uh the next talk from

276
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,720
jos earlier today they showed the

277
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,640
integration with

278
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:43,839
uh with the itinerary extraction that's

279
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,839
using exactly that system

280
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,800
another building block we created is the

281
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,800
k public transport library

282
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:57,519
so that's covering basically the dynamic

283
00:11:52,800 --> 00:12:00,719
data problem

284
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:03,200
giving you api for querying for

285
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:05,440
locations departures and arrivals at

286
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:08,959
those locations

287
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:12,880
and journeys between locations

288
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:16,638
this can talk to the two

289
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:20,399
free software uh services uh navita and

290
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:24,240
open trip planner as well as to

291
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:27,760
a few proprietary ends

292
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:29,680
and we have about 50 or so

293
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:32,000
configurations for different services

294
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:35,120
that then use any of those backends

295
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,040
um to actually get the data from

296
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,320
and the library picks the right service

297
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:41,199
for the location you

298
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:43,200
you're looking at and then gives you the

299
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:47,440
results for that

300
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:50,720
and of course we have the the actual um

301
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:53,200
kde itinerary application that's a

302
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,839
mobile app giving you um a timeline of

303
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,320
your

304
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,959
of your trip um that automatically

305
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,920
groups

306
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:01,040
the various uh bits on your itinerary

307
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:03,920
together so

308
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:06,560
that's my my for stem trip this live

309
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:10,719
weather report in between

310
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:10,719
i can show you the boarding passes

311
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:17,519
and it

312
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:19,200
can pull you delay information for

313
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:21,680
trains or

314
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,800
gate and platform changes if you miss

315
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,399
your train that

316
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:27,040
allows you to find an alternative

317
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:31,040
connection to get to your destination

318
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:34,079
um having all the data available it uh

319
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:36,639
it provides you some statistics on

320
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:37,359
how much you traveled in the last year

321
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:39,680
so if you're

322
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:41,839
watching out for your co2 impact for

323
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:45,519
example that gives you trends on

324
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:45,519
if you're improving over the years

325
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,959
one of my favorite features because

326
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:52,399
nobody else has it

327
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:55,599
is the power plug compatibility warning

328
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:57,920
uh powered by wiki data so

329
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,279
i mean if you're traveling to the uk you

330
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:03,040
probably know

331
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:04,800
they have weird power plug so but

332
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:06,480
some more normal countries like

333
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,399
switzerland or italy

334
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,000
coming from germany also need an adapter

335
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:12,560
and i tend to forget that

336
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,639
so the app seeing that i travel to those

337
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:16,160
countries or through those countries

338
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:19,279
reminds me to bring the the

339
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,279
corresponding adapter

340
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:25,360
something that is pretty new is

341
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:29,600
an assistance feature to automatically

342
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,120
fill the gaps in your itinerary so

343
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:33,360
i arrived at the main station in

344
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,160
brussels i have my hotel somewhere how

345
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:38,000
do i get

346
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:38,319
to the hotel it now suggested me to take

347
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,920
the

348
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:42,839
metro number two to wherever i needed to

349
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:46,399
go

350
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:49,760
um so that's that actually moving

351
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:51,680
from just managing data to actively

352
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:54,800
supporting you on this

353
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:58,160
uh that's another

354
00:14:54,800 --> 00:15:00,479
brand new thing that's the train layout

355
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,760
display so it shows me where on the

356
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:05,120
platform i need to go to

357
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:05,120
find my reserved seat

358
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,839
right and then finally how do we

359
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:13,680
actually get

360
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:16,000
the data into the app for that we have

361
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:17,920
plugins for a number of different email

362
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,680
applications

363
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:22,560
starting in kml of course because that's

364
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,560
where we came from

365
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:30,000
so that shows you a nice

366
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:33,758
uh nice to read banner on

367
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,600
um what it found in the email

368
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:39,199
next cloud you might have seen earlier

369
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:42,240
today doing something similar

370
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:44,800
released two weeks ago the third one is

371
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:46,320
thunderbird that isn't released yet but

372
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:49,519
it's basically going to have

373
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:51,920
the same functionality available there

374
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:54,959
as well

375
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:56,399
and last but not least we have the the

376
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:58,880
browser plug-in

377
00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:01,120
uh basically doing the same for for

378
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:05,040
websites you're looking at

379
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:08,560
um right

380
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:09,680
i'm done almost exactly in time one last

381
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,599
bit

382
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,719
forget about all the privacy stuff i

383
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,279
said

384
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:17,839
we need test data to improve the data

385
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:20,959
extraction so

386
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:23,680
please donate that if you want to learn

387
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:25,119

[Applause]

392
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,839
to respect the time and the time delay

393

394
