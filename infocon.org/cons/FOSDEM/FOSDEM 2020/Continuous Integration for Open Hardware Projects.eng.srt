1
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:08,960
good so um yeah good morning

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,719
and thank you very much for joining this

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,160
talk and thank you very much for luke

4
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:15,120
and the whole team for organizing

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:16,800
in this room and i'm gonna talk about

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,520
continuous integration for open hardware

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,600
projects

8
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,279
where i have to say we are not really

9
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:24,400
the experts i'm like a bit

10
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:26,400
trying to describe where we are now and

11
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,759
i'm happy to get also information from

12
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,198
you guys and

13
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,279
any questions that we could work on

14
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:34,480
together so um

15
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:35,360
my name is mario i'm from germany but i

16
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:38,879
stayed

17
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:40,640
10 years in asia and yeah we had a lot

18
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:42,160
of projects in asia and but we've had a

19
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,760
little bit cut off from the community

20
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,279
right i mean like fosdem is here and

21
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:47,920
everyone just coming and

22
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,879
but like in asia like at that time 10

23
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,239
years ago

24
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:53,839
and we felt a bit that things are going

25
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:55,360
on everywhere else

26
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,960
and we don't meet the people that we

27
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,360
usually meet in europe so what we

28
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,600
thought

29
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,640
is like we like fostering open source

30
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,120
software and like

31
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,799
hardware as well right and we need an

32
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,840
event so we started frost asia 10 years

33
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:09,840
ago

34
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:11,439
and at events people meet and have ideas

35
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,680
and then we say oh yeah let's open a git

36
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:15,199
repository and 10 years later suddenly

37
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,240
you produce hardware

38
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:20,159
so that's the story in short and um

39
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,399
yeah then of course like i'm from europe

40
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:25,680
so i also started a company here in

41
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:27,920
berlin it's called open tech and

42
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,479
yeah we're running uh projects together

43
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:33,840
also with european partners

44
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:36,640
for example like within the horizon 2020

45
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:39,119
program so we're always happy to make

46
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:41,600
open hardware sustainable also economic

47
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:42,159
economically and yeah i like languages

48
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,759
that are

49
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:45,200
why i like to go to different

50
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:47,040
conferences and

51
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,960
i like international music so it's like

52
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,720
really cool opportunity

53
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,320
so i want to tell you first a bit like

54
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,320
what we are doing

55
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,439
uh what projects we are doing in regards

56
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,960
to hardware

57
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:59,520
so we have the pocket science lab

58
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:03,119
project that started 2014

59
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:05,199
and it's a project that

60
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:06,479
um yeah that i can give it around

61
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,840
actually

62
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:09,840
so um

63
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,920
it's a it's a project for measurement

64
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:16,319
tools

65
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,000
so the idea is to have many um

66
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,720
measurement tools in one and there's

67
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,280
also an app

68
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,319
on the app store which you can check out

69
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,400
we have many just

70
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:25,359
integrated components we have a desktop

71
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,840
app um

72
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,640
so that's pretty cool and it sells well

73
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,720
in japan

74
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:36,000
already so how it works here you connect

75
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:37,840
basically a device to the

76
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,840
mobile phone for example android

77
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:42,080
unfortunately ios is not supported i

78
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,080
think many people know the problems with

79
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,440
apple it's not so easy actually always

80
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,440
to connect something to

81
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:49,280
to apple and then what you can do is for

82
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:51,840
example you have these different tabs

83
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,480
and behind each tab there is an

84
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,920
instrument

85
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:57,518
for example an oscilloscope so

86
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,040
something cool that happened recently

87
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:00,480
people said actually we can also use

88
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,760
that for robotics

89
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,879
so we had this idea that there are

90
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,518
robotic arms they can go into different

91
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:08,000
angles

92
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:09,760
and you can drag and drop for example an

93
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,239
angle into a timeline here

94
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:14,000
so um yeah getting into robotics as well

95
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:16,319
and here a few instruments

96
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,680
that are on the device so apart from

97
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:20,640
oscilloscope we have a

98
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,760
multimeter logic analyzer wave generator

99
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,399
power source

100
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,760
accelerometer and more and i don't know

101
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,280
if i said it at the beginning of course

102
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,120
it's all open hardware right i mean we

103
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,480
don't control the chip but like i think

104
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,560
like in this track

105
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:35,119
it's clear that we're talking about open

106
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:38,319
hardware another thing that we're doing

107
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,799
is this chip sorry this batch so this

108
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:41,518
badge

109
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:42,239
is not open yet but we are working on it

110
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:44,560
and

111
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:46,799
the first step was that um like there

112
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:50,080
was this guy on the internet

113
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:51,200
he uh basically reverse engineered the

114
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,840
protocol

115
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,439
and based on his hack we were able to do

116
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,519
an open source app already

117
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:58,959
looks like this it's also like just like

118
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:00,159
type into your phone so that's the

119
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,080
that's the first step and

120
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:03,760
we're really getting excited to to do

121
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,920
more here as well

122
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,959
so you can save and export clips you can

123
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,119
draw

124
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:11,200
on the badges something that we do and

125
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,040
the third project that we're doing um

126
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:15,119
currently is the neural app there are

127
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,560
already other projects like open bci

128
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,160
i don't know is anyone here from open

129
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,918
bci no

130
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,440
and they're also a project that is

131
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:24,000
called brain duino

132
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:26,479
basically the idea is that you can

133
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,320
collect your brain waves

134
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:29,599
and then you can analyze them for

135
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,960
example um

136
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:34,160
it's relatively uh yeah clear already if

137
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,880
you want to for example no

138
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:38,080
focus or relaxation things like that um

139
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,600
is already possible

140
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:41,359
and then it's the same model as with the

141
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,479
pocket science lab we make an app

142
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,840
and you can basically do it so um yeah

143
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:48,080
so what we are doing is

144
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:50,080
we already producing hardware the pocket

145
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:52,719
science lab is on sales and i'm

146
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,359
sharing a bit how we are trying to get

147
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,479
better

148
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:59,600
in development and so our idea was to

149
00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:02,320
um yeah use continuous integration

150
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,800
and many known from software and it's

151
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,360
like

152
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,800
out there since the 90s and continuous

153
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,600
integration has been developed with the

154
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,919
objective

155
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,720
to reduce integration time and to

156
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:13,280
continue

157
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,080
to provide continuous software updates

158
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:17,198
yeah so

159
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:18,080
builds okay and yeah continuous

160
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:21,600
integration

161
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:22,240
of software today so you could build and

162
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,720
test

163
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,400
after each integration in a continuous

164
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,800
cycle of build so for example

165
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:30,159
uh you make a pull request and then you

166
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,720
can um

167
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,080
basically test does your pure guest work

168
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,960
this is in software

169
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:38,479
and so the goal is that integration

170
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:40,320
becomes kind of a non-event it's just

171
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:43,440
like going on and it's always clear

172
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:44,400
that uh yeah that pull request or that

173
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:48,000
merge request

174
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:50,799
that will work um yeah and cycles are

175
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,320
developing building compilation

176
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:55,360
executing automated

177
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:57,840
tests and inspections and

178
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,759
continuous integration you can also say

179
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,239
continuous deployment could be part of

180
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,840
that

181
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:07,039
so you deploy the software automatically

182
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:08,880
right for example on the server um like

183
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:10,159
yeah google and so on have made it uh

184
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:12,159
very easy

185
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,360
to do that with a cloud but we don't

186
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,400
always want to be on the google cloud

187
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,319
with our software

188
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,840
so it's also possible to do that with

189
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:19,680
scripts there are other solutions

190
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:21,840
to do this as well like so continuous

191
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:24,560
integration continuous deployment

192
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,359
so usual development workflow in force

193
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,199
asia

194
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,039
um so enforce azure projects so we have

195
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:30,880
around 200 repositories

196
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:32,800
and like more than four thousand people

197
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,880
registered on our github right but we

198
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,639
all know big names people come and go

199
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,400
and then don't unregister they

200
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:40,560
just stay and of course we're happy to

201
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:42,799
keep everyone connected so whenever

202
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,319
somebody tells you big numbers uh take

203
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,280
it with a how do you say an english

204
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:48,080
grain of salt

205
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:49,359
right so but like um we have a merge

206
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:52,479
pull request um on

207
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:55,360
average every 15 minutes and

208
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:57,360
so that's kind of good thing already and

209
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:00,639
this is our workflow so at first

210
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:03,199
a function or feature or bug is solved

211
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:04,800
or developed in the developer workspace

212
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:06,080
so how we are working we don't have

213
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,400
feature branches

214
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,520
like we because like we what we had in

215
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,880
the past we

216
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:13,198
also tried that out with feature

217
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:15,280
branches and so on and

218
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,400
then like some developer like gets a job

219
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,198
or has something else to do and

220
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,758
disappears

221
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:21,120
and we have like 40 feature branches and

222
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:22,720
we're losing track

223
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,160
and then somebody says oh yeah i'm

224
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,759
working on this feature no no somebody

225
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,280
else works on this feature but like it's

226
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:29,680
not taking care for months and

227
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:31,440
you know so we said like look it's great

228
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,199
if people contribute but like

229
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,880
um it's a lot of overhead to take care

230
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:36,000
of like what is actually going on all

231
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,919
these different projects

232
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,840
so what we say is people work in their

233
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:42,560
own workspace they

234
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:44,239
make a their own branch in their own

235
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,960
repository and when they are ready they

236
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,879
can then

237
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:49,840
um make the uh um pull request from

238
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:53,039
their own

239
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:56,159
um forked uh repository

240
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:58,639
yeah so not inside the project so

241
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,160
and uh yeah how it's then done of course

242
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:03,360
the developer

243
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:05,919
runs the build locally and

244
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,840
solves any integration issues um the

245
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:10,719
pull request is finally made

246
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:12,000
and then we have usually like i don't

247
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,759
know if there's any repository

248
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,440
where we don't have a ci tool so let's

249
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:18,479
say travis ci

250
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:20,240
or circle ci um we like github actions

251
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:23,360
of course as a cool idea

252
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,800
but we're not sure yet um how much

253
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,599
integration that would be like

254
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:29,840
like if somebody moves the repository

255
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:31,199
and they don't use github

256
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,718
does it still work with github action

257
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:33,599
and so on so we are not clear we don't

258
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:36,080
want to have the

259
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:37,919
this kind of vendor lock in yeah so so

260
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:41,039
at the moment we're still like focusing

261
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:42,799
on those and um yeah so tests are run of

262
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:45,360
course developers need to write

263
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:46,640
tests and um yeah if everything is good

264
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,720
the code is merged

265
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,000
and as i said um in some cases

266
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,720
automatically just

267
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,519
deployed so how can we transfer this

268
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:57,040
idea

269
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:58,959
to um hardware development so what's the

270
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,079
difficult uh or the difference or the

271
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:02,800
similarities of

272
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:04,560
um this uh hardware so we have uh

273
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,279
configuration and hardware projects of

274
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,959
course okay

275
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,399
that that's what we have can write that

276
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:10,399
into code um

277
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:11,920
writing and maintaining test cases test

278
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:14,560
scripts is also

279
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:15,360
possible right i mean hardware is not

280
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,359
just like

281
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,279
hardware there's a firmware on it there

282
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,120
are some um

283
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:22,560
test cases that we could run for example

284
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,720
on that as well so

285
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:27,119
all this is possible and yeah so you

286
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:30,000
could trigger various test scenarios

287
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,640
you could uh also collect metrics yeah

288
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,040
um

289
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,760
you could analyze results uh keep track

290
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,480
of

291
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,839
build logs um something like that and

292
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,680
yeah we had a talk yesterday

293
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:41,839
of keycard and another track so it's

294
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:45,439
also cool and what is upcoming

295
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:47,760
um in this area yeah and so

296
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:49,200
want to go a little bit like how we are

297
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,000
doing this now with hardware how does it

298
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,800
work with hardware

299
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,920
so we are producing in china and i think

300
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,760
like production in

301
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,199
europe is also getting better and better

302
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,000
but actually we had a lot of people who

303
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,680
speak chinese

304
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,680
so for us it wasn't like a big gap that

305
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:04,000
we need to go to a provider and

306
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,880
and check this out for example this is

307
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,360
wetad

308
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:08,800
um our the the foss asia office main

309
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,160
office is in singapore

310
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,359
so that's the international hub where

311
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,560
people speak all kinds of different

312
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,360
languages and

313
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:17,680
he is a chinese speaker so um he helps

314
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,360
us to get the hardware development done

315
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:21,359
in china and it's really important

316
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:23,040
because if i ask something in english

317
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,640
they say yes and if you ask in chinese

318
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,439
exactly the same question they say oh

319
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:28,240
maybe not

320
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,120
yeah so so it's really it's really good

321
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,040
that we have that

322
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:34,160
and there are a lot of questions i think

323
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:36,079
that we cannot go into detail now in um

324
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:38,399
here in this sessions but i would like

325
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:39,680
to um also like

326
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:41,519
i think other people are also thinking

327
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,880
about this integration things and there

328
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:44,800
are a lot of questions coming up for

329
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,200
example we have all these machines and

330
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,839
like

331
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:50,079
this is not like travis ci and then like

332
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:50,560
travis ci sends the data to this machine

333
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:52,560
right

334
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:55,040
for example so so this is something that

335
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,439
i think is is important to talk about

336
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,680
and

337
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:59,200
uh of course we want that needs

338
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,399
standards that needs integration that

339
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,240
needs apis

340
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:03,760
and it's very important that we talk

341
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,240
about these topics here

342
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:08,560
in in the open source community because

343
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:10,079
we don't want companies coming up

344
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:12,000
and having the same fights that we had

345
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:12,399
with free and open source in the past

346
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,640
yeah

347
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:16,800
where people say patents non-standard

348
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:19,760
software and so on so this is all

349
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,719
um uh yeah important and we have some

350
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,640
experience here

351
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,399
uh producing this already so we're happy

352
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:27,279
to work on you guys so

353
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:28,079
um okay and so integration from hardware

354
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:31,120
now our wish

355
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:32,000
list so configuration and testing should

356
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:35,519
be

357
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,920
uh yeah getting easier yeah and so when

358
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:38,320
we

359
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:39,279
for example like we would like to learn

360
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,440
more what

361
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:42,560
um cli tools are out there what are

362
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,160
other people using

363
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:46,880
what are the things missing for example

364
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:49,760
there's this company and that we are

365
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,880
talking to a wiki factory yeah they have

366
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:53,439
they have ideas

367
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,320
so um and we have this consortium on the

368
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,800
european level

369
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,399
where we like actually collecting these

370
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,399
questions is already a big thing

371
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:01,600
yeah so if you could talk to me about

372
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:03,200
this um

373
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,760
for example the create automatic

374
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:07,920
creations of bom build of materials

375
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:09,760
yeah um where you have like a list of

376
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,240
materials and for example you have

377
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:13,839
different

378
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:14,480
um different suppliers yeah funnel or

379
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:16,480
others

380
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,920
and you can like uh upload your bill of

381
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,639
materials and automatically

382
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:21,199
see what is the outcome uh what is the

383
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:23,120
cost

384
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,639
and what's the cost if i order 100 and

385
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,079
so on so all these

386
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:28,079
things right so because what we want

387
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:30,160
with continuous integration

388
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:31,279
we want the same thing as software make

389
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:33,760
a button make a

390
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:35,279
pull request merge request merge that

391
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,920
build the whole thing make all the tests

392
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:39,040
but actually

393
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:39,680
build the real device yeah so it can be

394
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,639
shipped and

395
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:44,560
emerged that would be our dream so what

396
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:48,160
do we need to to make this happening

397
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:51,599
um yeah so um of course we want to like

398
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:54,079
learn um how far can we go in a digital

399
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,880
way yeah i mean what can we solve

400
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:58,000
digitally and

401
00:12:54,880 --> 00:13:00,480
um what can we do um in regards to

402
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,639
producing real prototype devices you

403
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,079
know jlc pcb and so on it's just so

404
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,480
cheap like five dollars or something and

405
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:08,079
you have

406
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:12,000
you have a board already

407
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:14,880
so that's cool so and possibly automatic

408
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,399
recommendations why not write yaml files

409
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:19,040
and say okay

410
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:20,079
this uh producer for example or this

411
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:22,719
component supplier

412
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:24,079
is supporting the frost community and

413
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,279
why not write that in the yaml file and

414
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:27,040
make that a preferred

415
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:28,639
producer of open hardware or something

416
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,839
like that i mean all kinds of things

417
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:32,160
that i could imagine

418
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:33,600
to really like grow the ecosystem in

419
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:36,240
open source hardware

420
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,040
so what we see is basically in the

421
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:40,720
hardware

422
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:41,599
uh creation process it's a similar cycle

423
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,680
to software

424
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,519
yeah i mean especially the further

425
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:48,160
people are away

426
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:49,600
from the development i think the more

427
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,560
they think the process is really

428
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,959
different but like

429
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:54,479
we feel what we learned so far about

430
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:55,119
like producing creating and producing

431
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,600
hardware is

432
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,639
it's really similar so you um for

433
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,480
example like so you

434
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:03,279
have this cycle right you have this

435
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:06,160
cycle and you orchestrate task

436
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:07,279
tasks in a sequence um where you then

437
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:10,399
have a pipeline

438
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:11,760
you test it you you improve it and you

439
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:14,079
receive feedback

440
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:15,279
and continue development on this

441
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:17,359
feedback i mean

442
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:19,519
it's really similar to um software

443
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:23,279
development and

444
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:25,839
so to make hardware ci possible um

445
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:26,880
we like an automation engine is like

446
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:29,440
really necessary

447
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:30,720
yeah and it should be deploy should be

448
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,480
able to deploy

449
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,320
um i don't know we don't have so much

450
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,480
experience with fpga

451
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,360
but i think like uh there's this project

452
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:41,199
uh

453
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:43,600
of uh bunny huang and um sean like in

454
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:44,319
in singapore and we connect with them a

455
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,959
lot

456
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:48,399
in um in singapore right they're based

457
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:49,920
in singapore we have the foss asia

458
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:51,199
summit in singapore every year so so

459
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:56,079
that's really cool they had this

460
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:57,839
small fpga um usb development

461
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:59,439
device so that's that's cool but not

462
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:01,760
everything is fpga yeah

463
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,199
and not everyone knows about it and i

464
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,560
don't know their pros and cons so maybe

465
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:06,000
we could have people who really know

466
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,638
about this because i see some people are

467
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,480
nodding

468
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:10,880
yeah maybe we can have workshops on this

469
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:13,360
in future and learn more how to how to

470
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,320
do that and develop here apart from the

471
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:17,680
prototypes

472
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:19,360
so how far are we now in this endeavor

473
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:22,800
so what we are doing for example we are

474
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:23,839
creating automatic deployments using

475
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:27,839
kidspace

476
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:29,680
and yaml um i haven't seen kaspa here at

477
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:32,880
the event like he was here last year

478
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:33,599
so um for example we integrated a yaml

479
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,600
file so

480
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,639
kidspace is pretty cool it already does

481
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,040
a lot of things what

482
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:40,560
what we need so um it enables an

483
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:44,719
automatic uh

484
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:46,880
generation um of kind of like uh

485
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,720
like a list of things to build maybe i

486
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:51,600
just show it it's easier to show than

487
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:53,360
to to to talk about it maybe and yeah so

488
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:56,480
on each merged

489
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:57,920
pull request this yaml file is executed

490
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:01,040
and it connects to the

491
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:03,360
kidspace and it generates a part list

492
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:05,279
and yeah and then this partners can be

493
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:07,120
matched with different suppliers

494
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:08,480
so this is basically still on the level

495
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,399
of part lists but like

496
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,920
why not bring this to the next level

497
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:14,880
like let's say um

498
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:16,160
to to really produce the board and to

499
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:18,959
see what else we can do

500
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:19,759
so um we have this repository here for

501
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:23,599
example of the

502
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:26,240
uh we have pocket science lab hardware

503
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,680
and it's a very simple yaml file so um

504
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,600
it basically tells you

505
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,719
um where is the gerber file where are

506
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:34,560
the gerber files

507
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:36,959
and it has a link to um bombsheet ods

508
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:38,160
which was before uh automatically

509
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:41,518
created by

510
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:42,079
kicad yeah so we are already going into

511
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:45,040
this

512
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:45,439
uh direction and um yeah and then like

513
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,279
this

514
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:49,279
number file is executed and then we have

515
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:52,320
this page

516
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:55,120
on the kidspace website and kidspace

517
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:57,519
itself is open source right i mean like

518
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:59,040
that's really important for us yeah um

519
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:00,880
we can always like they can be cool

520
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:03,199
services that's not always open and we

521
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:05,280
we use them like you know github itself

522
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:07,199
but like git is open and here even like

523
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:10,559
the whole kit space

524
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:11,600
a service is open so um they generate

525
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:14,959
automatically

526
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:16,000
um these uh links also and you basically

527
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:18,160
can click

528
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,039
then you can for example click adjust

529
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:22,720
quantity

530
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:23,280
so how many um like prototypes you want

531
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:26,240
to

532
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:28,160
produce and then you can see what is the

533
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:31,919
price are these components available

534
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:32,880
and you can click on any of these um

535
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:34,480
suppliers

536
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,919
and and check out and then basically

537
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:38,799
order it yeah and

538
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:39,600
uh yeah i mean it sounds really great

539
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:42,559
already

540
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:44,639
but uh yeah the question is how how

541
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:47,280
standardized are these components list

542
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:48,480
or always so you still should check you

543
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:50,080
shouldn't just like go there

544
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,520
and mario said that and let me try that

545
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:53,600
out you should still

546
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:55,120
check are these the real components like

547
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,000
sometimes like there might be slight

548
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:59,120
differences

549
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,240
um or yeah like so that's something we

550
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:03,678
need to

551
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:04,720
work on and get more um get more

552
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:07,200
experience

553
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:09,520
so from continuous integration to

554
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:12,880
sustainable continuous deployment

555
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:14,639
redeployment and recyclement yeah um

556
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:16,080
ten years ago we had this talk even

557
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,760
moreland came to berlin the

558
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:19,360
chaos communication congress was still

559
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:21,120
in berlin and he said uh

560
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:22,879
open hardware is the next big thing and

561
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,559
then there were people talking yeah

562
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:27,039
it's really good for the environment and

563
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:28,000
all these yeah it's sustainable like

564
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:30,240
it's not like it's right

565
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,760
to repair and all these things yeah and

566
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,640
now 10 years later we have this topic

567
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:35,840
and i'm like

568
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:37,840
yeah sounds like a deja vu yeah

569
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:39,360
and but like it's it's also an

570
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:41,280
opportunity for us so we shouldn't be

571
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,559
tired to just repeat the conversations

572
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:45,600
that we had years ago

573
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:48,639
we should really try to do this and

574
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:50,879
this whole thing about open hardware and

575
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:52,559
continuous integration um could be

576
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,400
deployment let's really like

577
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:56,799
think into the future it's not just like

578
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,880
about building hot hardware

579
00:18:56,799 --> 00:19:00,639
could we also do something like the

580
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:03,280
assemblement machines

581
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:05,039
yeah where we say uh here are components

582
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:07,840
um just like you can deploy

583
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:10,559
your software again on a server could

584
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:12,480
you like disassemble the the hardware

585
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:14,639
and and do this right i mean like it's

586
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:17,520
it's it's not impossible

587
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,160
yeah and so this is this is the thing if

588
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,480
you

589
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:23,360
really think like everything is open and

590
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:25,520
you have the cr you could also have the

591
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:26,399
how to call it yeah let's let's let's

592
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:29,360
phrase

593
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,720
let's phrase a uh um a sentence and

594
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:33,918
that's make it big or something yeah i

595
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:36,400
mean so that your dsm is so ci solutions

596
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:38,320
um enable us to publish a new version

597
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:40,320
and devices to be produced anywhere

598
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:43,760
automatically here another thing

599
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:45,039
right we can ship the um the final

600
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,960
design everywhere in the world and

601
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:48,720
produce it locally i mean we're always

602
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:52,080
always talking about small boards

603
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:54,480
but how about we talk about uh cars and

604
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,760
trains and spaceships in the future yeah

605
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,200
we could do all kinds of things that

606
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:59,280
should all just be open

607
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:01,120
it is just like necessary for

608
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:04,240
sustainability

609
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:06,719
and so we need machine integration

610
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:07,360
to deploy full or fully automatically so

611
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,720
it's a

612
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,399
it's a problem right i mean these

613
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:12,400
machines that we see

614
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,159
before i showed you the the picture of

615
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:16,240
the um

616
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:17,919
um what's it called in english i don't

617
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,039
know so so where you put the reels in

618
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:21,360
and you produce

619
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:23,440
the hardware and so on right i mean they

620
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:28,959
are not open yeah i mean i wasn't

621
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:32,480
in shenzhen not last week so relax

622
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:35,600
so a while ago

623
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:37,840
so last year last year

624
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:39,360
so um right and and they have these

625
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,639
machines and they tell you wow twenty

626
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,719
thousand dollars and you can produce

627
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,360
everything and so i i don't know but

628
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,200
like right

629
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:46,639
uh do they follow open standards like

630
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,880
what can we do here in

631
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:50,240
in in this area that we can really plug

632
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:54,799
in we we send

633
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:57,280
our um hardware design here and and they

634
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:58,960
really do it and how how open can we get

635
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:00,639
that let's work together on

636
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:02,000
on on doing this and this is something

637
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:04,080
that we try to

638
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,159
also uh push on the on the european

639
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:07,360
level to have more research right i mean

640
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:10,640
when they have these

641
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:12,719
uh big research projects um and yeah

642
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:14,480
i don't know five billion dollars right

643
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,000
i mean like and there's just the word

644
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:19,360
open hardware

645
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:22,720
somewhere in this big european

646
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:25,439
uh book that they do right and

647
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:27,039
so it okay yeah all these car

648
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,240
manufacturers big companies and so on

649
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:30,720
they get like maybe like

650
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,840
most of it but how about 200 million

651
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,840
really for

652
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:35,439
creators of open hardware companies that

653
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,720
do that and so on so that would be good

654
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:39,120
so let's get these

655
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,919
these topics also um on a european level

656
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,439
and

657
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:43,039
connect on this so this is this is

658
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,960
important um

659
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:46,158
and yeah i already said we need

660
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:48,159
disassembly machines

661
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:50,159
all devices could possibly be

662
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:52,159
automatically be disassembled

663
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:53,919
and components could be reduced or

664
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:55,039
recycled we really need to go in this

665
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:57,280
direction

666
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:58,559
so continuous integration can enable us

667
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:01,120
to make open hardware

668
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:02,639
economically sustainable i mean i always

669
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:06,639
see this sustainable

670
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:08,640
topic in regards to the

671
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:09,679
ecology but we also need it in

672
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,080
economically

673
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:12,720
and this is something that i'm trying to

674
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,960
do

675
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:16,000
so because i know a lot of hackers and

676
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:18,080
they make

677
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,440
yeah they they do something and for

678
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:21,360
example we had this cool project where

679
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:23,280
we hacked the knitting machine and i up

680
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:24,799
and we collaborate and so on right but

681
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:26,480
then the project is done

682
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:28,320
and and they're happy we achieved the

683
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:30,080
goal so let's move on to another project

684
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:32,158
so it's not really about like

685
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:33,678
changing the fashion industry make it

686
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:35,039
into a circular economy or something

687
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:36,159
like that and that's something that i

688
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:38,799
would like to do

689
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:39,600
really like um work with people together

690
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:41,840
on

691
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,959
on the missing parts and pieces to make

692
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:45,120
this um

693
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,799
possible and it all needs to be open

694
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:49,120
because if i don't have time somebody

695
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:52,240
else should be able to continue the work

696
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:53,760
that that we are doing so um and of

697
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:56,080
course like

698
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:57,039
this whole process makes a development

699
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:59,520
um

700
00:22:57,039 --> 00:23:01,120
uh more reliable and and faster by

701
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:03,520
automating parts so

702
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:04,320
uh right i mean we have all these these

703
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,760
problems with

704
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:07,840
with the environment and so on but like

705
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:10,158
maybe could we also solve these problems

706
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:12,559
faster i mean it takes seven years to

707
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:13,679
um get like from design to really like

708
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:16,399
creating a car

709
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:17,360
it could be shorten this process yeah by

710
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:20,080
automating

711
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:20,559
uh these um integration processes even

712
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:23,678
on

713
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:24,799
on on a really big big level and could

714
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:26,640
be lower costs

715
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:28,240
yeah i mean that's all like kind of i

716
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,679
think like people nodding here of course

717
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:33,200
we can know a lower cost

718
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:36,480
by by doing this automatically

719
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:38,000
and we can speed up regular updates and

720
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,960
support the building of a developer and

721
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,200
user community

722
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:42,240
which cannot be copied yeah i mean

723
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,080
people always say like

724
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:46,080
we had this talk this morning of the uh

725
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:49,360
um of chris and so on

726
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:52,158
um it can't be copic copied

727
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:53,279
and we need um we need the community

728
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:54,080
right i mean you can always copy

729
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:56,080
hardware you can

730
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:58,080
copy software but you cannot copy a

731
00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:01,039
community that's dedicated

732
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:02,000
so this is impossible so where to get

733
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:03,520
the hardware

734
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,960
by the way that we are that i showed at

735
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:06,080
the beginning you can just go to fos

736
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:09,360
asia you can of course

737
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:11,039
um download all of it um

738
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:12,799
some people say oh it's not really open

739
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:14,480
the chip is not open yeah unfortunately

740
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:16,960
we are not that far but i know

741
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:18,240
many people here working on this and you

742
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,600
can order it everywhere and of course

743
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,880
you can collaborate with us

744
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,719
you can if you have a company or

745
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,600
something you can talk to us um if there

746
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:26,640
are any ways

747
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:29,760
to to share um like experience

748
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:31,360
and maybe do workshops meet us on the

749
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,320
project chats we have a few hundred

750
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:34,799
people there

751
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:36,000
and so it's really cool to connect and

752
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:38,000
here are the chances to connect for

753
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,039
example so the fourth asia summit is in

754
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,400

755
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:42,960
uh from march 19 to 21 and we also have

756
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:45,039
like a

757
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,320
