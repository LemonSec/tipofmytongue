1
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:14,159
okay

2
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,479
all right this is another lightning talk

3
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,960
of five minutes is there another one

4
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:19,560
that wants to queue up after this talk

5
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,039
or not

6
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:26,320
[Music]

7
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:29,680
yeah just a few minutes then you can uh

8
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:33,279
okay okay let's go um okay

9
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:34,000
hello hi uh wanted to talk about a small

10
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,200
project that

11
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,840
was very useful for me um i had the

12
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,400
problem with

13
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,360
uh to get out of band management of out

14
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,759
of a router

15
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:45,280
an open dvd router that's typically have

16
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:48,240
a serial console over

17
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,200
3.3 volts and i thought about using

18
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,560
wi-fi

19
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:58,560
to extend that console and accessing it

20
00:01:52,560 --> 00:02:01,840
remotely so i used a esp8266 board

21
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:05,040
where i used a firmware called g-link

22
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:08,399
made by someone a community and a

23
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,399
company in holland

24
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,400
so see this this is an opportunity

25
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:14,800
router with three wires one for ground

26
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:22,000
one for tx1 for rx

27
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:24,560
and the esp8266 board um

28
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,920
so the firmware is from g labs called

29
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:30,160
esp-link

30
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:33,518
and it has a nice uh web interface

31
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:36,959
where you can specify the baud rate

32
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:40,319
that you want and there's also

33
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:41,120
a nice gui for the wi-fi so you can scan

34
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:43,359
the wi-fi

35
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,760
choose your access point put your key i

36
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:50,239
want to connect to that one

37
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:53,440
everything through the click of home um

38
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:57,280
so one interesting thing i did was

39
00:02:53,440 --> 00:03:00,640
uh to telnet so you can send it to the

40
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:03,440
um to the ip of the esp

41
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:06,480
on port 23 and then you get the serial

42
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:09,680
console out of that

43
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:12,720
um there was some like some

44
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:15,360
some option where i had to pass this

45
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,879
mode characters otherwise the back was

46
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:20,159
not working

47
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:23,518
um what i also did was

48
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:24,079
i wanted to have uh the serial console

49
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:26,640
but on

50
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,840
uh transfer it to my laptop so that my

51
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:31,279
laptop would see

52
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:34,560
a slash dev tty usb 0.

53
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:37,360
um and then i use the socket

54
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,360
socket option

55
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:44,480
so socket stdio tcp connect to the ip

56
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,480
address of the

57
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,840
esp

58
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,959
and then the second option is socat

59
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:56,959
pty and then link to slash dev v-mode m0

60
00:03:54,959 --> 00:04:00,319
so v-mode m0 is the new

61
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:04,000
uh is the new dav entry i want

62
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:06,399
to to behave as a as a would have a

63
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,360
no a standard cell port on my on my

64
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,080
laptop

65
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:13,120
put some weight slave and then specify

66
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:15,200
the ip address of the esp8266

67
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,959
and then i could do a screen over this

68
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:20,000
uh serial interface

69
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:24,960
and have the the console as i would have

70
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:26,960
had with a normal usb to serial adapter

71
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,560
one thing i also experimented with was

72
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,400
to send files

73
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,880
with the python program called serpai

74
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:36,479
dot serial.pai

75
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:40,000
uh where you do serious by the file

76
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:43,199
the destination uh and then the

77
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:47,440
the the deventry

78
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:50,160
and it took in timings

79
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:52,560
i did for 100k file it took eight

80
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,560
minutes

81
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:59,759
so this is 1.2 kilobyte per second

82
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:01,280
a one megabyte file would have taken 85

83
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:04,639
minutes

84
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:06,880
or uh one hour 25 to complete uh but

85
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:08,160
there are ways to specify higher board

86
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,479
rates but that needs to be

87
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,320
the target needs to be configured uh one

88
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:13,520
thing i want to do i wanted to do was a

89
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:16,240
commercial device

90
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:17,039
take an esp in the right form with some

91
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,840
kind of uh

92
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:21,440
headers that you can find you can choose

93
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,880
with the jumpers all the combinations

94
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:25,759
possible with the pins

95
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:28,080
and then normally on let's say

96
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:31,039
openabilty routers you have four pins

97
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,599
the vcc in 3.3 the ground the txrx and

98
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:34,800
have a

99
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,600
directly an esp on there connected to

100
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,919
that and then

101
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,720
furthermore have some kind of server

102
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:42,719
device

103
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:45,680
some cloud stuff where i could send this

104
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,720
and optionally also even encrypt it uh

105
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,240
so that

106
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,000
yeah on the other side you could connect

107
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:53,440
to the server and then have a

108
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,280
console back to your device so that's

109
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,969
pretty it

110
00:05:55,280 --> 00:06:02,318
all right thanks

111
00:05:56,970 --> 00:06:04,880
[Applause]

112
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:05,759
again if there are questions please see

113
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:10,080
benjamin

114
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:12,720
outside so we have a few minutes until

115
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,719
the next talk

116
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:21,840
so who is it

117
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,550
[Music]

118
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:38,080
and also it changes every year so

119
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:50,240
[Music]

120
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:51,758
here yeah go perfect right in time

121
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,000
that's great

122
00:06:51,759 --> 00:07:03,840
otherwise you're losing precious minutes

123
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:03,840
so this right there okay

124
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,440
you
