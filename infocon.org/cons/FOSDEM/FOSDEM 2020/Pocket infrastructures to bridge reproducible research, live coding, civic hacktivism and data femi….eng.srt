1
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:12,879
i think i'm going to put this

2
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:16,320
i'm going to be catch by the belt

3
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:20,480
can you listen hi can you listen

4
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:24,160
okay good so first um

5
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:27,599
like uh i'm sorry what's your name yes

6
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:31,840
paul i was expecting you

7
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,840
more french

8
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:37,120
you're not as french as you should be

9
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:40,640
[Laughter]

10
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:44,800
yeah okay yes good thanks paul yeah like

11
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:46,320
paul said i am here on behalf of uh

12
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,718
offline

13
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,160
he couldn't make it he couldn't find any

14
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,960
funding for coming and

15
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,519
the expenses for coming from colombia

16
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,920
pretty

17
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,199
high so i'm going to just start by

18
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,600
presenting myself

19
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:00,719
and asking ask you for some kind of

20
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,760
forgiveness i'm

21
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:05,760
preparing this in less than half a week

22
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:07,280
and i'm using this software that i never

23
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,360
use in my life before and it's

24
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,840
uh it's kind of mind-blowing because it

25
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,439
does not go in line like

26
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:15,439
slides by going multiple lines it's more

27
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:18,798
like a three like a mind

28
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:22,000
map so it's uh i'm really new in this

29
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:23,840
so i'm in santiago bravo i'm er from

30
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,960
argentina so that's

31
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:28,799
kind of a latin american fraternity

32
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,720
uh i'm working in india so that's why

33
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:31,439
for me it's easier to to come by i'm

34
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,920
working in

35
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:36,079
in france and actually that that's why

36
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,400
also i can i can be today somehow i got

37
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:38,839
some

38
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:41,840
money from them i will come in anyway

39
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,840
but

40
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:47,439
and i'm also a pharaoh developer

41
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:50,960
pharaohs is the main language behind

42
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:54,158
graphoscopia so this is why

43
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:58,000
we also know each other

44
00:01:54,159 --> 00:02:00,320
uh so this is a really

45
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,520
funny title like uh offred likes to put

46
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,119
like uh

47
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,280
pocket different to breach

48
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:07,680
representative research like calling

49
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,038
civic activism and data feminism for

50
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,319
from the global south this is the first

51
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:12,480
time in my life i can say it all

52
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:16,000
together without stopping

53
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,720
okay uh it has a little again it has a

54
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,840
lot of

55
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:23,840
corners that i am i'm from i.t i'm

56
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,840
not from and he's from

57
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:30,640
[Music]

58
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:32,640
yeah art and humanities and designing

59
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:36,559
creation so

60
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:40,559
well mines were completely different

61
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:42,480
so first what is the graphoscopy is

62
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,720
is a tool that is focusing in what we

63
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:47,440
call reproducible research

64
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,400
so i will show you just briefly how it

65
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:52,160
looks like

66
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:54,879
this is a basically it's an editor

67
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,599
that allows us to to do like by example

68
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:58,720
um

69
00:02:55,599 --> 00:03:00,159
jupiter the difference is that the the

70
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,640
main difference with jupiter is that we

71
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:03,440
are not

72
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:05,518
uh we are going we're using especially

73
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:08,879
pharaoh it's not a diagnostic

74
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:09,440
language agnostic platform and is based

75
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:13,120
on

76
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:18,400
on an ide actually jupiter is going

77
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:21,599
is trying to build an ide of its own

78
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:24,720
usage and we are using an ide to go

79
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:26,079
to the notebook

80
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:29,359
software so that means that we are going

81
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,360
kind of on opposite paths

82
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,760
the general idea is that we can

83
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:37,200
visualize and edit

84
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:39,359
text in a tree fashion

85
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:42,560
so we are going to have some different

86
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:44,720
notes representing main titles etc

87
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,239
so here we can see the something is

88
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,599
really interesting is what is the

89
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:51,760
configuration that we're going to use

90
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:51,760
for creating a pdf for creating a

91
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,959
an html page etc the idea

92
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:58,159
the main idea of all of this is going

93
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:01,360
towards the

94
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:04,000
the reproducibility the idea is how

95
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:06,480
do you do to get exactly the same result

96
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:10,239
that you have been shown before

97
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:12,319
so the idea is just to press on export

98
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:14,640
as a pdf

99
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:15,679
once it's done just to to be able to

100
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:19,039
open it

101
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:22,240
but this has to be done first okay

102
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:25,040
and the idea is just to to be able to

103
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,840
to export it and to be able to use it

104
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,160
and

105
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,119
again same ideas as jupiter that he has

106
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,160
to be able to

107
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:34,240
to use code i saw one sexy

108
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,280
example of it but i'm not sure yeah by

109
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,759
example

110
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,758
this one

111
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:45,840
here so basically the idea is we can mix

112
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:46,719
code data and text itself and we can

113
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:50,638
deliver it just

114
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:52,080
as a as a package and the idea is to be

115
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:54,400
able to

116
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,440
going back to the to the presentation to

117
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,719
be able to

118
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:00,320
bridge code data pros and visualization

119
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:03,520
to be able to

120
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:06,000
to create content that has real uh

121
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:07,440
solid ground being able to say okay what

122
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,240
is the data that is used for

123
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,840
doing this this article so you you

124
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,039
should be able to find it inside the

125
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,520
same

126
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:17,199
uh inside the same program it's not the

127
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,599
same graphoscopy what are the what is

128
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:21,600
the algorithm you use for

129
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,120
for analyzing this data you should be

130
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:26,160
able to find it exactly

131
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:28,720
the same fashion in the same program

132
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,080
so the idea is to be able to again put

133
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,840
all the things together so you can

134
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,400
analyze the pros you can analyze the

135
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,520
text

136
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:38,080
you can easily jump to the data or to

137
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,520
the algorithms and be able to match and

138
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,520
understand what's happening

139
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,440
what is the consideration in between the

140
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,320
the information that we are reading that

141
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,360
you're getting

142
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:49,840
and the real data behind and the way of

143
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,440
analyzing it so the idea of of this in

144
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,359
general is then to bring

145
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:55,360
what we call the scientific method

146
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,800
basically because this i i suppose this

147
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,160
is not something that is weird for

148
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,600
anybody here

149
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,400
it looks like most of you are coming

150
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:05,600
from some kind of science background

151
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:07,599
um so the general idea to is to

152
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,039
be able to try to follow the the same

153
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,120
kind of strictness

154
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:13,120
in the past so we're we're having to we

155
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,199
can solve my hypothesis we're going to

156
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,639
to match this hypothesis with some data

157
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:17,280
with some analysis and being able to

158
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:20,160
stand by

159
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:21,919
by them and to be strict no because

160
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:25,039
nowadays we can find the

161
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:28,400
auxes everywhere we can find a lot of

162
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:30,400
uh texts that i know

163
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:32,840
you just have to open the newspaper and

164
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:36,318
look at the fancy statistics it's really

165
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:38,239
hilarious sometimes and then they never

166
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:40,479
explain you about the i know standard

167
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,960
deviation of the population of the

168
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:43,840
amount of population how many yes yes

169
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,239
ninety percent of

170
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:47,758
of how much every everybody from the

171
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,800
same neighborhood probably

172
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:51,360
so the idea is is to bring this kind of

173
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,720
tools

174
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:57,759
this kind of of a way of working

175
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,479
and for helping activism in general that

176
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:01,919
is the

177
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:03,199
the off right main main domain and data

178
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:05,520
journalism that this

179
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:06,560
is also interesting for me is i use it

180
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,919
especially for

181
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:13,759
documentation and for for

182
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:15,280
trying to build my own book for

183
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:17,520
explaining how to use frameworks that i

184
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:19,840
do so it's nothing to do but

185
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,599
the main idea is to be able to do things

186
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,919
that are socially

187
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,919
nice

188
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:30,080
so in the idea is i'm going to show you

189
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,120
a bit on the

190
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:37,840
i have two up

191
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,840
interesting so this is the oof

192
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,479
with the second maybe it's not a good

193
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,318
way to show it i was not

194
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:46,000
this is a virtual machine this is a

195
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:48,560
version in in

196
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,919
linux i'm using this version to be

197
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:53,599
honest because i was

198
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:55,039
lazy to reinstall all the sqlite

199
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,800
things that i need for making run the

200
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:59,680
panama papers

201
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:01,360
work that offray did but the idea is

202
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,120
it's just this by example we can

203
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,800
execute this and it's going to generate

204
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:08,000
this map or we can

205
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:09,840
go a bit uh down

206
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,680
where it is okay i'm not sure if i'm

207
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,080
going well i can i can show you after if

208
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,639
you are

209
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:16,800
interested the idea is that the all the

210
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:19,840
uh yeah by example this one

211
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:22,000
these are all the countries that are not

212
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:24,239
uh related with the panama papers in

213
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,360
general then after we can see all the

214
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:29,520
all the all the countries that are

215
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:32,880
related with the panama papers

216
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:35,598
by example here so here we can see

217
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:37,360
the the country and the amount of uh

218
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:41,200
offshore accounts

219
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:44,560
and all of this is directly download by

220
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,560
the it's nearly query

221
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:50,480
to the database that we just

222
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:53,518
download from from a site that is

223
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:55,760
sharing this sql sqlite

224
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:56,800
database so and the only thing i have to

225
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,319
do is to

226
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,560
check what is the implementation of this

227
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,920
this is a method noise is a function in

228
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,959
some part of the

229
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:07,439
of the system we can just go in to check

230
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:08,959
what is doing inside this one is not

231
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,519
that interesting

232
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:12,479
let's say but here we can see already a

233
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:15,440
query

234
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,800
an sql query we can know exactly where

235
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:20,560
it comes from

236
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:23,040
oh nice we can uh we we can exactly

237
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,640
know what where it comes from what is

238
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,680
the query about if it is filtering

239
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,439
something if we are

240
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,279
hiding some information or not if we are

241
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:32,800
processing preprocessing some

242
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:35,920
information or not so the idea is

243
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,479
always to be able to connect again the

244
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,000
the whole

245
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,519
the whole text and the whole thing the

246
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:44,720
book with

247
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:44,720
uh with this data

248
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:49,120
so that is from the side of uh i can

249
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:52,319
show you a video so i

250
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,560
just loved before so the the the result

251
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,720
of

252
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,479
all this graphoscopy other project that

253
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,760
i was showing you here this one

254
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,680
i'm going to put in pause because if not

255
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:03,279
i'm going to frame my battery

256
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:06,479
uh the the outcome is

257
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:09,600
is this uh after some design

258
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:12,800
of the html export

259
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:15,839
is this this nice blog

260
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,160
article that has here the same map which

261
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:20,800
has

262
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:23,360
generated before with with graphoscopy

263
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:24,800
and that it explains how to how how to

264
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,000
get the queries how to modify the

265
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,319
queries

266
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,560
so it he's always always in the world

267
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:33,360
we're trying to put together

268
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:34,479
what is our conclusion how do we do uh

269
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,839
how do you

270
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:40,000
how you are able to repeat it so

271
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:40,000
the

272
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:46,079
the idea is then to to be able to to

273
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,519
bring some

274
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:52,560
tech some technological

275
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:54,240
usages some coding practices into what

276
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:56,959
we call the activism in general

277
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,920
for activism well understanding in

278
00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:01,199
general

279
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:02,160
uh citizen engagement so trying to help

280
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,040
to

281
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:07,439
to disclose this kind of uh information

282
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:10,480
to explain what this information means

283
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:12,240
none of the leaks is a none of the leaks

284
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,720
is

285
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,399
it wasn't it was an information easy to

286
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:19,360
to grasp now we have a lot of a

287
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:22,160
big database with a lot of uh of data

288
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:24,160
but not really much

289
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,839
information so the idea is how how do we

290
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,959
do to bring that to the people so that

291
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:29,360
is what we call to be

292
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:30,800
as a digital citizen so digital citizen

293
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,200
again is

294
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,079
and this actually all this project is

295
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,240
about

296
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:37,279
it's about being activist because

297
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,040
actually

298
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:40,800
graphoscopy is not only the tool but

299
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:43,360
also

300
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:45,040
the people that is behind by example

301
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:47,040
this is a

302
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:49,599
a data week workshop but the week the

303
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,480
data workshop was a workshop in bogota

304
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,880
in colombia

305
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:56,079
that it was about gathering people from

306
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:58,079
philosophy from journalism from medicine

307
00:11:56,079 --> 00:12:00,560
teach them how to use the tool help them

308
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:01,599
asking to to help to to interact in

309
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:04,479
order to to get

310
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,440
a bit uh pondered and been able to code

311
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:09,040
themselves and

312
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:10,880
modify themselves the code of the

313
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:12,079
of the same tool of the things that

314
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:15,439
whatever thing they know

315
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:18,638
they need uh and being able to to

316
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:21,360
create their own things so this

317
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:22,000
leads us to the other to the next part

318
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,680
that is

319
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,440
all this empowering the the user for

320
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,479
being able to be also a coder for being

321
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,720
able to

322
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:33,760
to interact with the thing without being

323
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:36,639
in a in a kind of a black box or

324
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:38,000
in a way where we are kind of in a power

325
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:39,920
relationship no in between

326
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,720
the person that is able to do the change

327
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:44,639
and the person that needs to change

328
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,560
uh so that that leads us to what we call

329
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:47,200
data feminism that the feminism is

330
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,239
determined

331
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,880
is a term that was developed by women so

332
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:54,639
it's okay

333
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:57,360
we can say no uh really no if it was uh

334
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:58,000
saved by men i would i would end up to

335
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:01,120
to propose

336
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:04,839
to to agree with it but so the

337
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:06,959
idea is how to use the general proposal

338
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:10,959
of

339
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:14,079
of a data feminism i know if you are

340
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:16,560
aware of this definition is

341
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:17,279
to use the semiotic and philosophical

342
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:21,199
devices

343
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:23,600
of intersectional feminism so to use the

344
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:26,880
the the the understanding that the

345
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:28,880
constructive power of intersectional

346
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:30,880
feminism to understand the power

347
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,839
relationships in the data and in the

348
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:35,040
things that we are

349
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:37,920
creating so that this is

350
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:38,480
empowering the is this is trying to

351
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:42,240
break

352
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:45,199
the use of developer polarization

353
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:46,480
the the existence of uh of something

354
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:47,599
that you can execute and something that

355
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,600
you can edit and

356
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:51,120
it's never the same so you cannot really

357
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:54,399
mutate it you cannot really

358
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:57,279
do the changes that you need uh probably

359
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:58,480
if you if you at some point in your life

360
00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:00,560
you needed some uh

361
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,839
some species specific feature in some

362
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:04,560
software you probably

363
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:06,000
already passed by this pain regardless

364
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,359
if you're a developer or not

365
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,600
because maybe you're a developer but it

366
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:12,079
happens that you're a user of this tool

367
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,199
and this this feature is nowhere there

368
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:17,120
so this is what we call

369
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:19,519
in generally in general data feminism

370
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:21,600
there's a nice article behind and we we

371
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:23,120
contribute with graphoscopy to trans to

372
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:27,279
transform it into

373
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:30,639
a pdf offline what take us to

374
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:32,720
this is so hard to pocket

375
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:36,079
infrastructures

376
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:37,120
that is the one of the nice things of uh

377
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:39,040
nice ideas of

378
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:41,040
scorpio the idea is you just download

379
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:43,360
one thing that is the

380
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:45,279
the graphoscopy tool and and that that's

381
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,399
all you don't need to install any server

382
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:49,760
you don't need to install

383
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:51,440
any nothing and the

384
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:53,519
one of the of the main concerns is

385
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,839
offline first this is a

386
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:56,800
again this is a tool from and for global

387
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:59,920
south

388
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,800
global south are you are aware or what

389
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:04,079
it means in general

390
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:07,279
great i was not aware so so

391
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:09,040
the the idea is in south america i don't

392
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:09,600
have all the time or in everywhere all

393
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:12,560
the time

394
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,839
in internet connection so how do you do

395
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,199
so if you if you cannot

396
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:17,600
have an internet connection you cannot

397
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:18,560
write you cannot get the information you

398
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,240
are not

399
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:21,920
you're like a second class citizen you

400
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:24,880
know so

401
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:25,760
how do you do to to to take this kind of

402
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:29,519
things in account

403
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:31,199
and think and taking it in again for the

404
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:34,560
decision of what is the architecture and

405
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:34,560
how how do you do to

406
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:38,560
deliver something that the people can

407
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:40,560
use without having to

408
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:42,719
have a master degree for being able to

409
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:45,599
install wheel stuff

410
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:46,240
for being able to go through a lot of uh

411
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,639
of

412
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:51,600
weird configurations being myself i i

413
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:54,480
that is my job to install things

414
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,199
for having latex pandora things uh

415
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:58,399
working

416
00:15:55,199 --> 00:16:02,160
properly it was already

417
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:04,240
a challenge i mean i spent like one day

418
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,279
and i and i do this all the time for my

419
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,600
job so

420
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:08,639
i for a person that has no knowledge

421
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,759
about that

422
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:11,759
it should be really complex

423
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:22,160
so the general philosophical idea

424
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:22,959
behind original philosophical question

425
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,120
behind

426
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:26,160
graphoscopy is how do we change the tool

427
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,639
that changes so

428
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:29,279
again it's empowering the users of of

429
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:31,519
notebook

430
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:32,320
of notebook writers for being able to

431
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:35,360
change the same

432
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:37,360
notebook rider so

433
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,639
the idea in general is bridge community

434
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,480
so bring people

435
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:41,839
put together people from different

436
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:44,720
backgrounds people from i.t

437
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:45,839
people from from art people from

438
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,079
philosophy from

439
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:49,199
political sciences etc to put them

440
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:52,399
together

441
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:55,439
and and to

442
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:56,959
foment to to push the the interaction

443
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,480
no this is something that we forget a

444
00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:01,920
lot we do a lot of interaction with

445
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:05,120
people of our own domain and this is

446
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:07,039
is that is not healthy just a mental is

447
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:10,000
not healthy and and for

448
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:10,959
the positive i mean the as a creativity

449
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,480
is is bad

450
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:17,039
it concentrates creativity in general uh

451
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:18,319
in practices what we do is uh to plan

452
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:20,160
workshops to

453
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:22,079
to teach people how to use to help

454
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:25,439
people in using it and in

455
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:26,480
changing modifying in other things and

456
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:30,480
in general the idea of

457
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:33,120
future is global south

458
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:34,320
issues that i'm going to learn to to say

459
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:36,399
only the the cons

460
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:39,678
well the consistent scalability

461
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:41,600
sustainability visibility disposability

462
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:42,420
and the the pro of of being in the

463
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,639
global south uh

464
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:46,559
[Music]

465
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:48,960
according to offline i say it's nice is

466
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:51,600
that since we are always behind we have

467
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,480
always the chance of watching what the

468
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,559
things uh

469
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,480
where the things went wrong and try to

470
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:59,440
to do it as well

471
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:00,080
and one then okay more technical stuff

472
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:03,520
like

473
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:06,720
code quality and ui etc

474
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,720
so that's it

475
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:15,840
[Applause]

476
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,840
questions

477
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:45,840
site internet site and i want to read it

478
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:49,360
with confront or pdf

479
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:50,720
also i have only two an alternative

480
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:54,559
[Music]

481
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:57,120
one but one point is a good text

482
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:58,480
but very poor text only the same

483
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:01,360
character and so on

484
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:04,080
with control c control b yeah if i solve

485
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:05,039
observes them of two complicated texts

486
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:08,080
that's so

487
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:08,799
difficult so an attention to disabled

488
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:12,240
people

489
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:15,918
with this kind of thing of internet is

490
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:18,799
becoming uh uh something horrible

491
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:19,360
yeah yeah i know yeah i can't yeah you

492
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:21,760
understand

493
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:22,799
yeah yeah yeah and i completely agree i

494
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,720
i have my

495
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:26,320
my way of thinking that is it's time

496
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:29,840
that we enhanced

497
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:31,520
yes sir okay uh

498
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:33,600
well actually it was not a question was

499
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:35,918
mostly like uh pointing the the fact

500
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:38,320
that the internet makes the things more

501
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:39,679
more complex actually i completely

502
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:43,200
completely agree and

503
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:46,320
i i think that also gives a wider

504
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:48,559
arena for creativity it's like

505
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:49,600
before we had only monks writing then we

506
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:51,600
have a

507
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,959
print we start to have some printing

508
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,639
device

509
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,760
and yeah when there was some printing

510
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,559
device probably there was a lot of

511
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,240
people that was

512
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:59,840
that should not be allowed to write that

513
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,600
was writing

514
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,959
and the and and the same nowadays we

515
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:05,918
have internet whether a person

516
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:07,600
that knows just how to type can be able

517
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:08,799
to to write and waste your time when

518
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,000
you're looking for something in the

519
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:11,600
internet

520
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,520
but by other hand you have a lot of

521
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:16,240
people that before was not able to

522
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:17,679
to to have this this means for writing

523
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:20,799
and now

524
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:24,559
has the possibility so i i mean

525
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:26,000
like in a dilemma too is i understand is

526
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:28,320
there is a lot of noise and there is a

527
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:31,360
lot of uh crap also

528
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:32,720
but also i'm i'm i have my optimist side

529
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:36,240
i think that there's

530
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:39,840
also space for people to to

531
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,840
express a bit more

532
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:46,530
[Music]

533
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:56,399
we are using pandora so

534
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:57,120
yeah yeah yeah exactly exactly we use a

535
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,520
we use

536
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:01,439
actually the our software only exports

537
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:03,600
to markdown

538
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,960
and pandoc does the rest of the magic it

539
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:08,399
does the conversion to

540
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:12,880
latex html

541
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:12,880
pdf or whatever pando can do we can do

542
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,840
it

543
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:30,240

544
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,240
