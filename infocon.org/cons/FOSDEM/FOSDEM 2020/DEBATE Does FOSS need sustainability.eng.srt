1
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:09,040
hey everyone we're gonna get the next

2
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:11,679
debate started

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:13,840
a little a little explanation of of the

4
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:16,960
way you can help us keep it going

5
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:18,880
when we're gonna have a timer up and the

6
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,960
speakers are on strict time limits and

7
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,480
when we get to about 20 seconds

8
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,160
if we could start to let them know that

9
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,080
they're really running out of time

10
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,680
by snapping our fingers or rubbing them

11
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,799
together if we all do it together it's a

12
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,320
really nice sound

13
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,920
and when they run out of time we all

14
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,520
applaud which then

15
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,440
tells them that they're out of time in a

16
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:38,399
really nice way and they'll stop

17
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,920
speakers i will have notes by me where

18
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:40,399
you can see how much time is left so you

19
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,399
don't

20
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:43,440
have to turn well i'll have i'll put up

21
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:47,120
a five and a

22
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:48,320
two and a one all right yeah now finally

23
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,000
we're going with the mic like that

24
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,559
okay so someone else i'm going to hold

25
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,559
it yeah

26
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:58,640
so the the the the i believe that for

27
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:02,160
the affirmative position will be

28
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:05,119
uh that we need sustainability in

29
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,560
open source free software correct

30
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:07,280
sustainability initiatives right is that

31
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,479
what you're

32
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,760
sustainable right right and you're

33
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:12,720
taking the affirmative it does need

34
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,000
sustainability

35
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,158
okay and with that we'll do the first

36
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,439
affirmative can you hear me

37
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:21,600
yeah are we good okay yeah who can hear

38
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,600
me

39
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,600
okay you are eating right it's fine so

40
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,799
uh that's free

41
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:30,798
open source software needs

42
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:30,799
sustainability yes

43
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,479
we're done right yeah now but actually

44
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:38,280
the question is a little bit more

45
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:39,679
deep than that right what kind of

46
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:41,600
sustainability

47
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,040
free and pursue software it needs is

48
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,919
maybe the real question behind that

49
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,200
right

50
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,119
because we already have a kind of

51
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:50,240
sustainability for many projects right

52
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:51,439
we have many models many things that

53
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,640
works

54
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:56,398
okay but there may be time for some

55
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,200
improvements right and the debate here

56
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:59,360
is about what

57
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,719
what could be these improvements right

58
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:03,600
but first we need to remind

59
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:05,119
what is open source right we have only

60
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,039
seven minutes right

61
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:08,160
but the idea behind that is is open

62
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,680
source just a

63
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:14,879
legal framework for copyright or it's a

64
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:17,760
a movement a model a social

65
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:18,239
social idea right that we try to defend

66
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,959
right

67
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:23,200
a non-rival society where uh things

68
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:25,520
reproduce is into the comments right

69
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,799
what sustainability model we need for

70
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,520
that

71
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,480
for that definition right it's also

72
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,400
because humans

73
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,560
uh open source like every human

74
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,519
construction is made by humans

75
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,319
humans are weak you might change their

76
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:42,879
mind

77
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:45,679
when money comes humans are lazy

78
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:47,440
and humans die right so how we can

79
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,120
achieve sustainability over all these

80
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:51,040
human things right

81
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,680
how we can how we can have how we can

82
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:55,920
have this transcendental idea that

83
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,599
that uh that continues from the one who

84
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,440
we're before us and continues for the

85
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:00,560
one after us right so that's the first

86
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,200
thing

87
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,800
and and uh so i will uh so we need

88
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,480
better open source software

89
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,560
sustainability and and i will define

90
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,119
five points quickly five points for

91
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,120
these

92
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,400
new models right five minutes five

93
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,040
months great

94
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:17,200
the first one is uh the idea how we can

95
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:19,519
sustain the idea of sustainability

96
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:21,119
in open source software right the open

97
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:22,800
source software definition

98
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,200
is the first step but how we can sustain

99
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:27,840
it more how can it get more people to

100
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,359
know it to educate them to defend them

101
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,560
in their communities

102
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,120
but also how we can contribute to it to

103
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,840
sometimes

104
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,560
a model of how it has been decided that

105
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,959
was

106
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,959
not as contributive as it could be today

107
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:41,920
how we can open source the open source

108
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:43,280
definition

109
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,119
right to make it sustainable with

110
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,280
today's society right

111
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,319
right that's the first step the second

112
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,040
uh so

113
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:52,238
uh we need to enter that fire we need to

114
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,079
to keep it alive right

115
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:56,640
and so maybe we should we need to open

116
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:58,560
it the second thing is the people

117
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,079
right how many developers have are in

118
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,439
burnout because they have been

119
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,920
completely burned at the

120
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:04,640
fire of the open source software idea

121
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,040
right

122
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:08,159
how many projects are sustained on the

123
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:11,280
global level

124
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:13,359
but destroyed health and lives of the

125
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:16,160
loan maintainers in each of them

126
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,680
on 20 years yet sustainable but how many

127
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,519
casualties

128
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,440
we have seen in all of these projects

129
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:24,720
right so we need to define also

130
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:26,080
a global sustainability model and also a

131
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,320
a sustainability model for the

132
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:30,000
individual right that is there right

133
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,000
the third thing this the third thing is

134
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,759
the law infrastructure

135
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,360
right how we can have sustainable

136
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:37,040
license which are not the sustainable

137
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,600
license we talked about

138
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:41,840
that we close the software to sustain it

139
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,440
but sustainable license that will keep

140
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:46,719
open source software forever

141
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:49,199
as i call it free and always free

142
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,960
open source software right that's

143
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:53,520
different the promise that we make

144
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:55,039
make it open we stay forever right you

145
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,359
know and so we need to keep that

146
00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:00,400
infrastructure that law infrastructure

147
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,280
sane enough to have this living right to

148
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,400
be able to

149
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,919
uh always innovate in terms of of law

150
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,000
right

151
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:09,758
but also to be able to to be adapted

152
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,440
depending on the project so let's see

153
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:13,039
how that can work together the fourth is

154
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,560
the money right

155
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:16,159
we'll talk later about that in the

156
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,560
second affirmative panel but yeah we

157
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,039
need

158
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,680
we need sustainable funding right and

159
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:23,039
again

160
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:25,759
this system it works right now it works

161
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:27,759
for many projects but how we can have a

162
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,720
sustainability funding model that is not

163
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:32,240
based on

164
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:34,320
few corporations deciding to fund money

165
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,800
for organization to fund some project

166
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:39,520
they decide for their own interest right

167
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:41,280
so that's my fifth point how we can

168
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,520
apply all these first four models

169
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:46,080
into a more independent software

170
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,599
developer in open source model

171
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,280
right how we can apply all the same

172
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:52,320
money laws and

173
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:53,758
infrastructure ideas and people to

174
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:56,639
enable them to develop

175
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:58,000
yeah an independent model based on all

176
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:59,919
the first things

177
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,080
right that we enabled to leave from the

178
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:04,560
software they built because people

179
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:07,599
build it people use it afterwards the

180
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:11,600
solution to that really makes

181
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:13,600
the economical impact with

182
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,840
what people produce so it's not just

183
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,440
sponsoring deciding what are

184
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,119
like in french we call the kings the

185
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,680
side right the kings decide who they

186
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,680
fund

187
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,880
right but now like it's really matching

188
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,840
the users

189
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:26,800
and the producers right so these five

190
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:29,599
models define

191
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:31,199
what maybe maybe maybe the the better

192
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:34,000
sustainability right

193
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:34,560
i will just finish yeah oh two more

194
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,280
minutes

195
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:39,919
i'll just finish by saying that uh to

196
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:42,559
compare to environment right

197
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:43,599
if just imagine we ask uh yeah does

198
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,639
environment needs to

199
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,360
sustainability right it's obvious it's

200
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:49,280
yes right

201
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,560
it's just it's our living environment if

202
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:53,039
we want to live in a world where

203
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,840
open source software brings value in our

204
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:55,520
society

205
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:57,280
of course it needs sustainability right

206
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,400
it needs but it needs better ones better

207
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:01,919
than we have right now

208
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:02,638
we need to make sustainability costs go

209
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:05,599
down to

210
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:07,919
zero at maximum right to make to enable

211
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:10,159
more projects to be sustainable

212
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:11,359
i will just get that quote from a famous

213
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,919
psychologist to say

214
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,960
we don't inherit from the word from our

215
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:17,120
parents

216
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,239
but we just borrow the word from our

217
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,360
children right

218
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,520
it should be the same for up into

219
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:24,000
software right sustainability

220
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:25,039
over generations right based on the five

221
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,759
principles i've shared

222
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:28,479
i shared earlier right and so far people

223
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:31,440
think i'm a

224
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:32,400
youtubist right i've made two companies

225
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,000
that are profitable

226
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,840
i've done many things organized tech

227
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,759
conferences i'm in youtube peace with a

228
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,599
business model

229
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:41,280
right so it's possible and it's possible

230
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:43,199
and you will see in a second affirmative

231
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,719
section that is possible to have a

232
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:46,720
better sustainability models

233
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,960
for open source software thank you very

234
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,960
much

235
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:55,359
so by mutual agreement of both debate

236
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,719
teams a neutral party we'll be doing all

237
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,319
the cross-examination so i'm counting

238
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:01,680
that to miriam

239
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:03,599
thank you so um i actually have

240
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:06,000
two questions for you first question um

241
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:08,479
you said keep the fire burning right

242
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,560
um so people are really enthusiastic

243
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:13,039
sorry enthusiastic about it

244
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,240
and um you know we want to we want to

245
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:15,919
keep that up at the same time you're

246
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,319
proposing a system

247
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:19,680
which means that we need external input

248
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:20,800
to keep the fire burning doesn't that

249
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,479
actually mean

250
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,800
open source commune the open source

251
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:26,159
community needs life support

252
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,000
so your question is like does the

253
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:30,319
princess community need live support

254
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,759
yeah uh let's say that doesn't your

255
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:32,880
system mean that the open source

256
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:34,800
community

257
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:37,200
needs life support so i think i'm saying

258
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:38,640
the opposite i'm saying that uh open

259
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,839
source communities need

260
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:43,360
uh more independent source of

261
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:45,040
funding let's say if we could talk about

262
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,000
funding for example more independent

263
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:49,760
source of funding

264
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,560
and at maximum tied to the usage of

265
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:53,680
their software

266
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,640
so if they if we tie with the usage of

267
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:57,359
the software

268
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:59,279
and again there i don't know there are

269
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,640
ways to do that right

270
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:02,080
but if we tie it with the usage of the

271
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,360
software and we find a model there are

272
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:06,839
many models possible

273
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:09,600
right we can have

274
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:10,160
independent funding or community-based

275
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,240
funding

276
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,600
or user-based funding right i'm not

277
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,920
talking about copyright here

278
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,720
yeah just to say so we just everybody

279
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,640
knows right

280
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,480
but yeah so that would avoid this life

281
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,360
support thing because for for me the

282
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,440
life support is

283
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,480
people who is money sometimes with

284
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,399
models

285
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,240
who are not open source but they make a

286
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,760
foundation which has money

287
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,600
and then they decide to love support or

288
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,200
not this kind of project okay

289
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,480
um so i was going to ask you a second

290
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,680
question i'm going to ask you a

291
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,040
different question that i actually

292
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:40,319
intended for lewis but i'm

293
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:42,160
because it fits now so um but how is

294
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,000
that system then different from a

295
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:46,000
proprietary license i understand what

296
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,880
you're saying is that you don't get the

297
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,440
license free

298
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,640
from the entity using the software you

299
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,320
get it from someone else

300
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,839
but doesn't even doesn't that actually

301
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,200
mean you still need to pay for the

302
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:56,720
license somewhere

303
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,640
and it's actually not being paid by

304
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,440
those who use it how do you tie it to

305
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,279
the use

306
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,560
so just an example i didn't want to talk

307
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:04,240
about it here directly but

308
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:06,800
you asked me the question you attended

309
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:09,120
to louis so just an example uh trademark

310
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:11,680
right you can use thread you can make

311
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,279
people pay for trademark goodwill

312
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:15,040
of a software so it's that copyright

313
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:17,120
it's just trademark right a company

314
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,640
applies your trademark into a onto a

315
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:21,360
commercial brusher

316
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:22,079
right it's not it's not copyright here

317
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,000
but then

318
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:25,760
they make money out of your trademark

319
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,920
goodwill

320
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,040
right and so they can say oh actually we

321
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,640
use

322
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,480
your community what your community

323
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:35,680
brought to the system right

324
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:37,920
the trust represented into the trademark

325
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:39,599
right and so now we can pay you because

326
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,880
we make millions out of you not

327
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,920
copyright

328
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:44,320
trademark not intelligence the swag that

329
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:48,880
was

330
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,880
that's an option thank you

331
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:54,640
so so now we'll have the the first

332
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:58,000
negative um

333
00:10:54,640 --> 00:11:01,839
and what would you is doing that okay

334
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,839
so can you use that mic

335
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:09,519
seven minutes for the first negative

336
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:15,839
all right

337
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:23,040
so my friends um this all sounds very

338
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:25,839
jolly but

339
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,880
i'm making the gift of free and open

340
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:29,920
code to you and

341
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:33,279
i think you shouldn't look into the

342
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:33,279
gifted horse mouth

343
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:37,839
you're demanding sustainability but i i

344
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:41,518
think we don't need

345
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:43,760
that kind of sustainability

346
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:44,640
and in particular there's there's

347
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:47,839
eventually

348
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:50,000
a some kind of emerging military

349
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:52,560
industrial complex

350
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,240
of sustaining or so-called sustaining

351
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:58,479
organization

352
00:11:54,240 --> 00:12:02,800
and that would cover non-profits

353
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:04,720
such as the software freedom conservancy

354
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,839
the free software foundation that

355
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:10,399
demands

356
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:13,760
that you assign their copyrights to them

357
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:17,040
as well as for-profit or

358
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:18,560
non-profit 501 c6 consortiums which are

359
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:22,000
conglomerates of companies

360
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:22,800
such as the linux foundation the open

361
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,639
collective

362
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:28,959
and seminars all of these are

363
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:32,320
kind of a parasite organization which

364
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:36,959
are trying to scheme and take their cut

365
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:39,200
on top of your work anywhere between 10

366
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:41,040
to 20 percent sometimes trying to lure

367
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:43,600
you saying they won't take

368
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:45,439
any any cuts on top of the bonding

369
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:48,000
that's duly yours

370
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:50,839
for a period of time so i think we

371
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:55,120
really don't want nor need this kind of

372
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:55,120
sustainability that's my first argument

373
00:12:55,680 --> 00:13:01,519
the other thing is that again 300 pencil

374
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:06,000
software is a gift

375
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:08,480
by injecting sustainability requirements

376
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,040
which is your own mandate it's it's not

377
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,839
mine

378
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:13,599
i made a gift and and you want me to

379
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:15,680
assist and get gift forever

380
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,360
i don't think that's a fair uh fair

381
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:20,560
demand on your side

382
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:21,920
um you're also turning free and open

383
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,359
source software developers which are

384
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:26,240
volunteers into

385
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:28,160
uh some kind of hired guns you know they

386
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:31,360
want to sustain so

387
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:33,920
you're saying the emergence of

388
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:35,760
a software project that really demands

389
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:38,719
funding to be able to

390
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:40,560
achieve anything which is contrary to

391
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,800
everything i believe

392
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:45,279
are the ethos of free and open source

393
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,279
software

394
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,120
i already mentioned the notion of uh

395
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:53,839
this emerging

396
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:55,040
uh notion of a so-called sustaining

397
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:56,240
organization

398
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:58,240
in the end they're really the brand

399
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,199
thinking of sorts and they're trying to

400
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,760
make sure that

401
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:02,959
not only they take a cut on top of your

402
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,839
funding they're trying to get that

403
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:06,719
forever

404
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:08,079
uh by luring you uh in their

405
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:11,120
organization

406
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:14,959
worse than that some of your users

407
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:17,519
large corporations may actually demand

408
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:20,959
that you join these organizations in

409
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:20,959
order to use your software

410
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:27,519
there's another argument that can be

411
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:31,040
made that in the end

412
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:34,240
when you also found organization

413
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:36,560
and from projects and

414
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:38,800
it's really the ones which are the best

415
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:40,880
are seeking grants

416
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,399
that are eventually able to get the

417
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,480
money so you may

418
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:46,000
end up sustaining projects which really

419
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:48,240
don't deserve it

420
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,320
and you you see i won't point in fingers

421
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,440
to anyone they're really crappy code and

422
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:53,760
crappy project

423
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,560
that are heavily funded and and that's

424
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:57,439
not fair

425
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:58,160
right the best code uh the the the one

426
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,519
that proved

427
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,760
the best code may not be the one that

428
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:05,279
are the best at seeking grants

429
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:08,480
and and the best marketing there

430
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:08,480
um and

431
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:12,959
in the end you could even make an

432
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:16,079
argument that

433
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:19,279
somehow the way uh

434
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:19,699
first free software 300 software is

435
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:21,439
really

436
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:24,399
[Music]

437
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,399
equivalent to

438
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:28,160
diamond oils and minerals which are

439
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:31,199
being straight mined by

440
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:34,319
by by these sustaining organizations and

441
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:37,439
and somehow colonialist powers

442
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:40,880
so that's pretty much it

443
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:43,759
i think the free software free software

444
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:45,680
has been self-sustaining itself

445
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:47,199
and self-organizing itself for a long

446
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,800
period of time

447
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:50,399
and this self-organization is key to

448
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:53,439
success and

449
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:55,759
and this sustaining a

450
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:57,199
problem is not a problem it's something

451
00:15:55,759 --> 00:16:01,040
that actually spoils

452
00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:01,040
the whole 300 software

453
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:09,519
[Applause]

454
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,480
okay so first question for you um you

455
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:12,959
said

456
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,320
we don't need external support to

457
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:17,599
sustain

458
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:19,440
open source development right i'm not

459
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,079
saying we don't need external support to

460
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,839
sustain

461
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:23,758
open source development i'm saying we

462
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:28,240
may not need that kind of support

463
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:31,199
okay in particular if we're here today

464
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:33,600
how did we get there right this means

465
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:35,279
like for the last 20 30 40 years

466
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,480
nothing has been able to sustain itself

467
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:38,160
we wouldn't be here otherwise it

468
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,639
wouldn't be 10 000 people at first then

469
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:42,240
today

470
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:44,639
okay um but you say i mean you know

471
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:46,160
we're taking away like money or money

472
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:48,160
taking money from someone else putting

473
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:50,079
that into open source development

474
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:51,439
right that that's not necessary it will

475
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:53,599
work itself out right that's the

476
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:56,320
position position that i took away

477
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:58,720
so doesn't that mean that open source

478
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:01,199
development becomes less accessible

479
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,800
to just everyone in general because it

480
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:05,039
also means you need to be able to afford

481
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:08,399
to work on a project that doesn't really

482
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:10,720
properly pay you over time and

483
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:12,799
i mean i i get why you would make that

484
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:15,039
argument but how can you justify that

485
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:17,280
well i i think you you can make a very

486
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:20,480
simple darwinist argument

487
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,799
which is if software is not able to

488
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,240
assess

489
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:24,240
itself if a project is not able to

490
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:27,760
sustain itself it probably doesn't

491
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,760
deserve to be there in the first place

492
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:34,240
i didn't choose to be on that side of

493
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:37,439
the argument but

494
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:38,160
i'm doing my best efforts in good faith

495
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:41,200
to actually

496
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,200
support this point

497
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,879
um so other than that obviously you want

498
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,880
to support

499
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,000
those who can you know survive on their

500
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:52,799
own already

501
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:55,520
um how can you justify that

502
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:57,039
companies are already using open source

503
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,879
software to a large extent

504
00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:00,480
right and at the same time they are

505
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,640
developing other software

506
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,679
internally and they are paying their

507
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,840
internal developers

508
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:08,160
well whereas the open source software

509
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:11,678
that they are relying on even more

510
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:14,480
um does not get paid equally

511
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:16,640
well i think there's a there's a simple

512
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:19,679
argument that could be made there

513
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:21,520
if you're eventually depleting the

514
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:24,880
commands

515
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:27,200
of oxygen by

516
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:28,320
using open source without ever giving

517
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:31,280
back anything

518
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:32,000
these companies will eventually collapse

519
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:34,799
on themselves

520
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,480
if you were to think about something

521
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:39,039
like the linux kernel if nobody was

522
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:41,200
somehow collaborating and contributing

523
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:43,039
to it

524
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:45,679
their business will event companies that

525
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:47,360
rely on linux to run their business like

526
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:49,360
banks and large search engines would

527
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:51,120
eventually collapse on their own

528
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:53,840
so there's an argument that can be made

529
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,840
that uh

530
00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:00,480
this would eventually uh not be in their

531
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,480
long-term interest

532
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:09,199
so i i thank philippe for that i i've

533
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,159
never had i'm enjoying these baits i've

534
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:13,200
never had so much

535
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:15,440
fun being called an extortionist

536
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,440
um

537
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:21,440
[Laughter]

538
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:23,120
the skin that pays my salary fortunately

539
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:26,880
brought me here um so

540
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:29,600
so lewis will tune out the second side

541
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,240
i you know and i do want to uh correct

542
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,080
bradley

543
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:34,080
uh because he said that miriam was going

544
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:36,399
to be neutral and what he meant was

545
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:37,439
aggressively hostile to everyone which

546
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,760
is

547
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,200
so uh big thanks to miriam for jumping

548
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:44,400
in at the last moment

549
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:47,039
um i want to pick up on two threads

550
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,840
uh from what medi started us with and

551
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:50,160
those are

552
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:52,559
uh the importance of independence and

553
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:55,039
the importance of finances in

554
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:56,399
uh creating a healthy open source and i

555
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:57,919
think those are intertwined with the

556
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:00,160
sustainability right

557
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:01,440
so open source like the software

558
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:04,799
industry as a whole

559
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:07,840
is concentrating right we are all

560
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:10,080
at the end of the day uh

561
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:11,840
we're all at the end of the day uh

562
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:13,918
heavily dependent on microsoft and

563
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:16,080
amazon and google

564
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:18,480
to build the things that we want to do

565
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:20,480
now we like our corporate benefactors

566
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:22,320
uh everybody from github here no the

567
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:24,400
github folks left okay

568
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,840
we hate our corporate benefactors we

569
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,520
need to have

570
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:29,439
uh oh the google folks are still here

571
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:31,918
sorry um

572
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:33,760
we uh you know sustainability in the

573
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:35,600
context of independence

574
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:37,840
means that we want independence so that

575
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:40,000
communities can be strong and diverse

576
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:42,720
and not dominated by a single player

577
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,960
if the open source community you are in

578
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:46,880
is dominated by a single company

579
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:48,880
or even a small number of companies who

580
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:51,200
all have the same interests

581
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,000
then um that is not a sustainable

582
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,080
community

583
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,159
and so we need to figure out how we

584
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:57,120
sustain independence within our

585
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:58,559
communities

586
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,158
so that they can be the strongest

587
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:01,520
communities uh you know as we've been

588
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:02,559
hearing throughout the day from people

589
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:04,799
who both

590
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:06,559
apparently believe and do not believe it

591
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:09,360
communities are really important

592
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:11,678
and you know if all open source merely

593
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:13,840
flows uphill to google and amazon and

594
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:15,440
the sponsors of the linux foundation

595
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:17,918
uh what's the outcome of that you know

596
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:19,919
max sills from google was here earlier

597
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:22,400
and telling us that open source is about

598
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:23,840
love which is very nice and max

599
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,520
occasionally gives me free lunch at

600
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:28,480
their cafeteria

601
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:31,280
um but you know and it's a super healthy

602
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:33,679
lunch very san francisco fresh organic

603
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:35,440
so my heart feels good but then also i

604
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:35,840
have to leave eventually they throw me

605
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,360
out

606
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:39,120
and they also have a special cafeteria

607
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:40,639
just for employees that you're not

608
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:44,000
allowed to bring friends to

609
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:46,320
um or open source contributors so um

610
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,679
you know i'm not sure if licensing is

611
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,399
the best way to fight for this

612
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:50,080
independence

613
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,840
but i submit the fighting for it is a

614
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:54,480
great idea at the

615
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:55,760
sort of corporate level right there's

616
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:58,080
also individual

617
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:59,919
diversity in our communities right

618
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:01,760
getting involved in open source i want

619
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:04,080
miriam to be my lawyer

620
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:06,000
um as she was saying getting involved in

621
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:07,439
open source uh is an immensely

622
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,360
privileged thing

623
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,799
right so i got involved in open source

624
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:13,760
while i was in college

625
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:15,918
because i knew that i could dick around

626
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:18,799
and not get great grades in my classes

627
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:20,799
and life would still work out right or

628
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:22,320
at least i was dumb and young and stupid

629
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:25,520
enough to believe that right and

630
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:29,120
thankfully nobody told my parents

631
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:32,720
sorry um and um so

632
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:35,678
the um you know i

633
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:37,600
was able to spend a whole lot of time in

634
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:39,760
college that i probably shouldn't have

635
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:41,760
contributing to open source because i

636
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:45,039
had that immense privilege

637
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:46,400
of or naivete of believing that it would

638
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:48,240
all work out

639
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:50,640
we need to focus on sustainability so

640
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:52,799
that open source is a thing

641
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:54,240
that is for all individuals regardless

642
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:57,600
of their economic privilege

643
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:59,120
or their individual background not just

644
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,719
for the privileged few who are lucky

645
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:02,000
enough to get paid to do it

646
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:04,320
which brings us to the second point that

647
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,960
matty raised which is funding

648
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:09,360
so who here is super excited about

649
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:11,120
capitalism

650
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:13,199
all right the google employee is super

651
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:16,239
excited about capitalism

652
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:17,840
um and um so

653
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:20,000
we published a blog post on my company

654
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:21,840
blog a little while ago

655
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,400
that said essentially how many of you

656
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:26,720
here have heard of the phrase bus factor

657
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:28,080
in the open source context right so for

658
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,559
those of you who are not familiar with

659
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,720
it bus

660
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:33,039
factor is the notion of well what

661
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,760
happens to this community if the leader

662
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:36,400
gets hit

663
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,799
by a bus right which is a sort of grim

664
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,720
thing

665
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:40,000
right but the the core idea is that a

666
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:42,080
healthy community

667
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,120
if the leader gets hit by a bus everyone

668
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,639
will be sad

669
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:46,320
and then the community will still be

670
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:48,880
able to continue going forward

671
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:50,720
right here's the thing the good news is

672
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,279
in fact basically nobody gets hit by a

673
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,880
bus

674
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:54,400
what they get hit by all the time is

675
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:56,080
their bosses

676
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,919
so there's actually some great uh

677
00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:00,480
research from carnegie mellon that

678
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:01,679
uh looked a bunch of github and and

679
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:04,240
tried to figure out

680
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:05,840
why did communities uh why did open

681
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:09,440
source projects

682
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:10,639
go unmaintained and the single biggest

683
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:13,440
cause for

684
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:15,279
uh open source project going on maintain

685
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:17,520
was something at work

686
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:19,600
so they got laid off the company

687
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:21,600
switched from java to rails because it's

688
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:24,719
2020. and come on java

689
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:27,840
um where'd jim go um

690
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:29,440
and um you know and then all of a sudden

691
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:32,799
all their java libraries were

692
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:34,400
uh were unemployed were abandoned right

693
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:36,158
or their boss said you know we were

694
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:37,679
allowing you to do 20 time on open

695
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:38,960
source but now it's only 10

696
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:40,960
and you have to make some tough calls

697
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:44,320
right there and so um

698
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:45,840
that boss factor is really what's uh

699
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:47,120
the most one of the most important

700
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,918
things in sustainability when we're

701
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:50,320
talking about

702
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:53,200
how do we keep uh projects sustained

703
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:54,960
over the long term right

704
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:57,200
and this conflicts directly even though

705
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:58,880
it turns out bosses all the time

706
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,559
tell people sorry you can't work on that

707
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:03,520
open source anymore

708
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:05,440
by the way there are now four trillion

709
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:07,120
dollar companies in the world

710
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,480
and they are all heavily dependent on

711
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:12,239
open source

712
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:16,640
weirdly the acronym for them is mega

713
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:18,720
microsoft amazon google and apple um

714
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:20,320
you know and when these trillions of

715
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,679
dollars of value have been created by

716
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:24,639
open source

717
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:26,320
um doesn't that suggest some solutions

718
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:27,120
to our open source sustainability

719
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:29,039
problem

720
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:30,239
um i'm gonna speed through the rest

721
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:32,158
because i only have one minute

722
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:33,840
uh working for big companies is fine

723
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:35,360
right there's nothing wrong i do

724
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:37,039
genuinely love my friends at google

725
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:40,399
especially when they get me lunch

726
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:41,760
um but uh if everyone does that then i

727
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,000
would submit to you that open source is

728
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:44,158
not

729
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,360
very interesting an open source that is

730
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:47,039
healthy and vibrant

731
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:48,639
is not going to end up with us with all

732
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:49,840
of us working at those four companies

733
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,880
even though that sometimes looks like

734
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:54,000
the trend right now

735
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:57,039
so what do we need to do well uh

736
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:00,559
we should have new licenses uh

737
00:25:57,039 --> 00:26:03,039
that um you know uh prohibit car

738
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:04,240
that prohibit competition um that's

739
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:06,000
obviously one solution to the

740
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:09,360
sustainability problem

741
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,159
and um you know and i think we also need

742
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:12,240
new economic

743
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:13,200
models right where we help individual

744
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:15,120
developers

745
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,480
figure out how they can sustainably work

746
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:18,799
on open source

747
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:19,919
and um you know that's are we still

748
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:24,158
clipping or

749
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:25,360
clapping i can't five seconds we need

750
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:25,710
new economic models

751
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:32,399
yay

752
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:34,320
[Applause]

753
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,679
so you talked about the mega companies

754
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:38,879
right right um yet

755
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:40,559
you still want to put the developers in

756
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,600
charge of making sure the open source

757
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:43,120
community

758
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:46,240
is sustained or the communities are

759
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:46,239
sustained over time

760
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:49,600
why don't you put it on those who

761
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:52,639
actually use it most

762
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:54,240
oh oh absolutely um thank you thank you

763
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:55,679
for giving me that opportunity to talk

764
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:58,799
about new economic models

765
00:26:55,679 --> 00:27:00,559
you know i think that we need to um what

766
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:01,760
we currently do is we beg those

767
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:04,080
companies for charity

768
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:06,400
right we say oh please buy us dinner

769
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:08,559
please fund our conference please fund

770
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,760
uh conservancy you should all fund

771
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:13,279
conservancy

772
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:13,919
um but you know when we rely on guilt as

773
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:17,679
the model

774
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:19,760
as opposed to uh return on investments

775
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:21,440
that's not very sustainable right it

776
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:22,720
means they can roll out of bed one day

777
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:24,000
and say hey you know what actually i

778
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:26,559
don't feel so guilty anymore

779
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,320
karen's uh you know karen's just not

780
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:29,200
quite so effective in making me feel bad

781
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:32,840
today

782
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:36,480
so um i so

783
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:37,279
yeah uh so we're gonna drop a zero off

784
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,880
that check

785
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:40,559
like that's not a way to build true

786
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:42,559
sustainability that's

787
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:44,399
uh that's a charitable model that still

788
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:45,918
leaves us at the mercy of the

789
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:47,600
billionaires who run these companies so

790
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:50,480
it's definitely not developer centric

791
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:51,360
if we don't have an economic model okay

792
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:54,880
second question

793
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:59,039
um now you get someone to pay

794
00:27:54,880 --> 00:28:02,559
for the sustainability right you get

795
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:04,320
the guild factor is still okay right um

796
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:05,840
and then you go ahead because you have

797
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:08,559
the projects um

798
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:09,678
making sure you know sustainability is

799
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:11,120
present

800
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:12,960
and then you take money away from that

801
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,840
and don't pay all of the money that you

802
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,640
actually get in

803
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:17,360
um to the developers how is that fair oh

804
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,880
um

805
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:20,959
what i think uh somebody said of

806
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:23,279
something about a 20 skim earlier

807
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:25,360
and uh you know the apple standard is a

808
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:26,960
30 skim and we should aspire to be every

809
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:30,799
bit as good as apple

810
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:33,120
um and uh yeah i mean i think that

811
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:34,639
part of uh the way we're gonna build i

812
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:36,000
mean look this already happens right the

813
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:38,159
linux foundation is

814
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,720
the biggest sustainability player by the

815
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:42,960
way they don't employ any engineers

816
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:44,720
um and actually some of that is okay

817
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:47,120
right employing salespeople

818
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:50,640
uh employing people who help with

819
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:50,639
infrastructure and documentation

820
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:59,039
okay all right okay

821
00:28:55,919 --> 00:29:00,720
um the i was told

822
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:02,158
just yesterday by a linux foundation

823
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:05,039
employee that they proudly did not

824
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:08,880
employ any engineers i apologize

825
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:10,720
um the um but i think the general point

826
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:13,520
still stands which is that

827
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:14,399
most of the linux foundation subprojects

828
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:16,799
focus on

829
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:18,158
higher level governance infrastructure

830
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:19,200
and you know what those things are

831
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:22,000
valuable those are part of

832
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,000
sustainability

833
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:27,840
thank you

834
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:32,158
so mark jones will do the final uh

835
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:34,399
negative oh yeah

836
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:35,520
yeah uh sorry guys let's track where i

837
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:37,918
am um

838
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:39,120
uh and then we'll have cross-examination

839
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:40,640
for that and then we'll

840
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:42,479
they're doing no final rebuttal so we'll

841
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:45,200
have audience questions after that

842
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:46,480
so go ahead mark am i allowed to

843
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:51,200
disclaim the disclaimer

844
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:52,960
is it is it okay so yes you may

845
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:54,320
i i think most of what i'm about to say

846
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:55,440
i actually believe or at least i'll

847
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:57,039
believe for like i don't know

848
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:58,480
the rest of today so if you want to hold

849
00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:01,760
me to it that's fine

850
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:03,600
um so i think the the

851
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:05,600
really the problem here is that the

852
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:07,600
affirmative side is presupposing that

853
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:08,959
there is a sustainability problem right

854
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:10,559
and there there might be a

855
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,520
sustainability problem from a business

856
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:13,678
perspective

857
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:15,520
uh but the reality is is that the reason

858
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:17,679
why this conference is so big

859
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:19,200
the reason why businesses care so much

860
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:21,760
about free software is

861
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:23,039
that we have a lot of it we made a lot

862
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:25,039
of it in the last

863
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:26,480
you know 30 40 years we don't actually

864
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:28,480
have a sustainability problem

865
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:30,080
it might not be working the way that

866
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:32,480
everyone wants it to work and maybe it's

867
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:34,158
not optimized for some businesses

868
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:36,320
maybe it's not optimizes for some

869
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:40,000
businesses lewis might run

870
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:42,080
um i figured you know since we're

871
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,480
we're going personal by the way the the

872
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:45,678
word was symbiotic right not parasitic

873
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:48,880
that was what you're trying to defend

874
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:48,880
yourself as um

875
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:53,039
but you know we don't have to the free

876
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,760
software community shouldn't have to

877
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:56,000
change how

878
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:57,440
it operates to accommodate other people

879
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,159
we shouldn't have to compromise our

880
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:00,080
principles

881
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:01,760
as people believe in free software just

882
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:02,320
because it's more convenient for other

883
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:04,720
people

884
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:06,000
if businesses want to take advantage of

885
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:08,000
the great benefit

886
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,480
that free software is successfully

887
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,600
creating and has been doing for a while

888
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:13,200
and there's no reason to think it's

889
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:14,799
going to stop tomorrow in fact we're

890
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:16,720
probably getting even more of it

891
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:18,480
they should learn how to use free

892
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:20,320
software they should learn how to work

893
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,960
with free software the way free software

894
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:23,600
works

895
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:24,640
free software doesn't need big business

896
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:27,439
big businesses

897
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:29,519
need free software lewis is right the

898
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:30,399
maga companies were built off of free

899
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:32,559
software

900
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:34,399
so maybe they should figure out how they

901
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:36,559
can make even more money by figuring out

902
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:37,600
how we actually work how we produce this

903
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:39,600
free software

904
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:41,039
instead of asking us to change to be

905
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:42,559
more convenient to fit into their

906
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:45,760
corporate structures

907
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:46,720
maybe it's okay that we're right about

908
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:50,240
one more thing

909
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:52,080
right we were right about the licenses

910
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:53,760
we were right about how to build

911
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:55,360
software maybe

912
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:57,039
we're right about how businesses should

913
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:59,600
work too right maybe we're right about

914
00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:01,120
how businesses should treat other people

915
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:03,360
and that this is a lesson that we can

916
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:05,840
teach them i've still gone off my notes

917
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,840
at this point

918
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:10,799
oh yes the important thing um so you'll

919
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:12,399
notice if you look at the webpage

920
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:13,519
describing this debate

921
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:15,360
one of the things we were supposed to

922
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:16,640
talk about was the sustainable license

923
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:18,158
that have come out of last year

924
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:20,080
and i didn't hear a lot of defense from

925
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:21,760
it but the reality is

926
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:23,039
right part of the reason we're talking

927
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,600
about sustainability is because

928
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:25,679
businesses

929
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:27,120
want there to be a crisis so they can

930
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:29,600
justify

931
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:31,678
forcing people into using let's face it

932
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:35,039
our proprietary licenses right

933
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:35,919
you know the the sspl like really good

934
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:38,879
shot

935
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:40,480
really good shot at it and maybe there

936
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,799
is a world where you can convince me

937
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,799
like

938
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:44,399
these facts are there but it's not a

939
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:46,399
free software license

940
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:48,239
and you know even if you can make some

941
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:50,080
technical argument it's completely

942
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:51,440
disingenuous to say that you support the

943
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:54,480
free software community when you're

944
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:57,679
putting that license out there

945
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:59,279
these these licenses were created

946
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:00,960
because it's better for business and the

947
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:02,640
way they are operating right they built

948
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,279
their businesses off the free software

949
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,799
community

950
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:06,080
they went out to their customers and

951
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:07,120
said that they're selling a free

952
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:09,039
software product

953
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:10,799
because free software is cool and their

954
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:13,279
customers know it's cool

955
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:14,000
and they wanted the extra branding that

956
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:16,159
came with

957
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,600
being free software producers and now

958
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:19,840
that they're successful

959
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:20,799
and that their vc fund backers want to

960
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:22,320
cash out

961
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:24,080
they're trying to figure out well how do

962
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:25,039
we maximize the amount of profit that we

963
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:27,120
can get

964
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:28,320
and their answer is oh well let's just

965
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:30,320
pretend

966
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:32,158
uh that there's a sustainability crisis

967
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:33,840
and the only way that we can keep being

968
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:36,320
successful free software companies is to

969
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:37,918
stop being free software companies

970
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:39,678
that's and we'll just convince everyone

971
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:41,279
making free software that that's true

972
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:43,600
that if they want to continue to make

973
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:44,080
free software right who here in this

974
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,559
room

975
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:48,320
thinks that they need money to go write

976
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:50,559
code for an hour

977
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:52,399
like they don't right if you have a

978
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:53,200
passion for it if you have a reason for

979
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:54,639
it you can go

980
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:56,240
write code it's one of the great things

981
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:57,840
about our movement it's democracized it

982
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:59,440
we don't need permission

983
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:01,678
from large companies we don't need their

984
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:03,039
salaries to do it now i'm not saying

985
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:04,720
that you shouldn't get paid a salary for

986
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:07,440
your software you absolutely should

987
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:09,040
my salary is paid with free software

988
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:11,599
because there are business models

989
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:12,879
that work with the free software ethos

990
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:15,040
work with the community

991
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:16,319
and don't we don't go out and ask the

992
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,839
communities we work with

993
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:20,000
to change how they're operating with

994
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:21,440
we're okay with that when we figured out

995
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,960
how to take advantage of free software

996
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:25,918
the way it is without asking free

997
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,918
software to compromise

998
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:30,079
oh well i didn't prepare enough notes

999
00:34:28,170 --> 00:34:33,520
[Music]

1000
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:35,599
corporate homes this is another

1001
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:37,359
the idea that all projects need to go

1002
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:38,720
into some kind of non-profit home or

1003
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:41,040
for-profit home

1004
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:42,560
that's not the reality of it now some of

1005
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:44,399
them might be parasitic

1006
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:46,078
maybe there is a military-industrial

1007
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:49,839
complex i'm not going to name who's in

1008
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:49,839
it but

1009
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:53,200
um they have their purpose for it but we

1010
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,960
already have those models right the

1011
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:56,239
projects that that make sense for and

1012
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:58,320
there are a lot of them

1013
00:34:56,239 --> 00:35:00,078
can go to those homes we don't need to

1014
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:01,760
create new kinds of it

1015
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:04,240
we certainly don't need to force every

1016
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:06,000
project into it even if it's convenient

1017
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:07,919
for some businesses yeah it might be

1018
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:10,079
easier for some businesses

1019
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:11,280
to go say oh well i really really really

1020
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:12,720
want an exception

1021
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:14,400
so it would be great if you can go find

1022
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:16,078
a corporation and the board of directors

1023
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:17,680
so you can have a boss who will tell you

1024
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:18,720
like oh all we have to do is centralize

1025
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:20,078
our copyright so you can give an

1026
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:21,680
exception because it's really really

1027
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:22,800
important for this one person

1028
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:25,440
that they don't have to follow the

1029
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:27,440
license but a lot of projects

1030
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:29,119
are fine just being projects the

1031
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:31,280
motivations for creating that project

1032
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:33,040
might not be to satisfy every business's

1033
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:34,240
whim it might be because they have

1034
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,359
something else maybe they're using it

1035
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:36,560
for a side business

1036
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:38,000
maybe they're using it as part of a

1037
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:39,200
larger business model maybe it's a

1038
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,880
hobbyist project

1039
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:42,240
we don't need to find homes for all

1040
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,880
these projects in some kind of legal

1041
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,640
structure

1042
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:46,880
and we know that because these projects

1043
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:47,680
existed right if the project didn't

1044
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:49,599
exist

1045
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:51,118
oh maybe we have to think about that but

1046
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:52,160
you don't tell me that a project has

1047
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:54,560
existed for a year

1048
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:56,000
two years five years ten years without

1049
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:57,680
someone on a corporate master

1050
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:00,480
needs a corporate master to continue to

1051
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:00,480
exist in the future

1052
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:04,480
i'm going to reserve the balance of my

1053
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:07,520
time

1054
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:10,240
okay so um currently sustainability

1055
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:10,720
is well not an obligation but it's more

1056
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:12,959
like a

1057
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:15,520
charity thing that companies can do or

1058
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:19,119
users can do if they want to right

1059
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:20,640
um now if you say companies are at the

1060
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:22,640
same time or

1061
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:23,680
many many developments right are

1062
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:25,279
depending to

1063
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:26,879
a large extent on free and open source

1064
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:28,880
software

1065
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:29,920
shouldn't everyone who's using open

1066
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:32,400
source software

1067
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:33,200
really care about sustainability because

1068
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:35,839
if

1069
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:36,879
what lewis said is true and there is uh

1070
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:40,400
what was it called

1071
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:42,640
bus bus factor sorry yes

1072
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:43,920
um and there is a bus factor um isn't

1073
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:46,720
there a threat that you just

1074
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:47,119
use the basis of your development at any

1075
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:50,319
time

1076
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:52,640
unless you you care about sustainability

1077
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:54,400
yeah that sounds like a business problem

1078
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:55,279
i mean it's in and that's kind of my

1079
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:57,760
point

1080
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:58,480
no no no that's my point is that if if

1081
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:00,560
businesses

1082
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:02,160
are worried about the sustainability of

1083
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:03,520
free software they shouldn't ask free

1084
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:05,040
software to change

1085
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:06,560
they're getting a gift from the free

1086
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:08,560
software community

1087
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:09,759
uh they took advantage of that gift they

1088
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:11,279
now realize that they've created a

1089
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,720
dependency on it because they're

1090
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:15,119
being competitive in the marketplace

1091
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:16,480
relies on it so what they need to do is

1092
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:18,079
they need to figure out how to work with

1093
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:19,920
a free software community

1094
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:20,960
it's not a sustainability topic for the

1095
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,079
free software community it's a

1096
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:23,359
sustainability problem

1097
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:25,359
for corporations who've chosen to be

1098
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:27,279
dependent upon it yeah but isn't that

1099
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:28,720
the same thing then is it doesn't that

1100
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:31,920
then necessarily mean

1101
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:32,879
that you need to ensure you you keep

1102
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:34,160
that alive

1103
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:36,320
what you keep alive what you're

1104
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:38,000
depending on and isn't that exactly what

1105
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:39,760
this is about

1106
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,119
for the for the businesses and that's

1107
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:42,480
what i'm saying but the business why do

1108
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:44,000
we care if the business succeed i i

1109
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:45,520
would be perfectly happy

1110
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,800
if all the proprietary software

1111
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:48,480
companies went out of business and

1112
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:50,079
replaced with free software companies

1113
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:51,440
without having to compromise the ethical

1114
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:53,280
values in the community without having

1115
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:55,280
to draft new licenses that are clearly

1116
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:57,599
not free software licenses

1117
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:59,280
that doesn't uphold every single project

1118
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:01,200
though that that doesn't ensure

1119
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:03,119
sustainability for all projects

1120
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:04,480
no and that's i mean that's one of the

1121
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:05,920
great things that's well that's one of

1122
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,800
the reasons that make capitalism works

1123
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:08,480
right that's one of the things that

1124
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:10,400
makes free software work is that not

1125
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:12,079
everything deserves to survive

1126
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:13,599
right like there some things are going

1127
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:14,960
to fail and that's okay

1128
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:17,440
actually i think free software

1129
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:20,079
encourages that right last question

1130
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:21,440
um so if it's not sustainability like

1131
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:24,079
proposed here

1132
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:25,520
what's your solution how how do you make

1133
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:26,960
sure

1134
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:28,560
i'm still trying to figure out what the

1135
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:29,359
problem is because i think the real

1136
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,640
problem here

1137
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:33,839
is that people are pretending there's a

1138
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:33,839
problem on sustainability

1139
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:40,960
[Applause]

1140
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:42,320
if we do this next year i think miriam

1141
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:44,240
just got herself recruited as the

1142
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,640
permanent cross examiner all day so she

1143
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:46,399
may

1144
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:47,680
regret that i don't want to thank her

1145
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:49,280
for doing that um

1146
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:51,040
again i want to mention the uh the

1147
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:53,440
panelists uh agreed to forego

1148
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:54,400
their rebuttals so that the audience can

1149
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,920
ask questions

1150
00:38:54,400 --> 00:39:01,839
um you're welcome to ask a question of

1151
00:38:55,920 --> 00:39:01,839
either side or both uh

1152
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:05,440
and i asked the panelists to share i

1153
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:08,000
apologize we only have

1154
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:09,520
two mics that's the fosdem set up so

1155
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:15,839
please be fair to each other

1156
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:15,839
each side with a mic that you have there

1157
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:29,839
no questions that's the end of the day

1158
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:29,839
i've got a question

1159
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:35,920
one of the panelists said that if you've

1160
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:37,598
got an hour you can always do

1161
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:39,040
open source you can always write code

1162
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:40,800
which is true

1163
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:42,960
some of the things that's necessary to

1164
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:44,640
make a successful community

1165
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:46,320
maybe take a bit longer than an hour

1166
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:47,359
maybe do need skills that aren't

1167
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:50,800
available

1168
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:52,480
how how can we help companies sustain

1169
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:56,240
communities with things other than just

1170
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:57,680
the code contributions

1171
00:39:56,240 --> 00:40:00,160
is that question directed at anyone in

1172
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:00,160
particular

1173
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:03,119
all right you were the one who said we

1174
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:04,319
could do it in an hour yeah we can do

1175
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:08,160
everything in an hour

1176
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:09,839
um i think that's a great question right

1177
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:11,279
and i think the answer is that companies

1178
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:13,359
really should find out how successful

1179
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:15,359
free software projects have worked

1180
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:18,000
um and make it part of their employees

1181
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:19,839
jobs officially not just an extra 20

1182
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,680
time where yeah you could go you know

1183
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:23,279
volunteer at a non-profit or you can

1184
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:24,799
work on a free software project

1185
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:26,240
if the company's really built off of

1186
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:28,560
free software then make that your

1187
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:30,078
business model and pay your developers

1188
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:31,680
to write free software as their

1189
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:33,280
full-time job like there are ways of

1190
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:34,720
making that work just don't

1191
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:37,040
expect free software developers who

1192
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:39,118
don't work for you to adjust to your

1193
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:42,240
corporate business model

1194
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:42,240
we're staying in character right

1195
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:46,800
yeah to answer uh to add to your uh to

1196
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:48,960
answer your question uh

1197
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:50,640
let's retake the comparison with

1198
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:52,560
environment right everybody can have an

1199
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:53,920
hour to go clean the street or make

1200
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:55,839
something good for the planet

1201
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:58,240
who does it more than one hour two hours

1202
00:40:55,839 --> 00:41:00,000
ten hours it needs to be managed right

1203
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:02,319
at some point the society every like

1204
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:04,240
every comment needs to be managed right

1205
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:06,240
so this is a dream that

1206
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:09,680
hobbies can change the world only

1207
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:09,680
themselves if they're not organized

1208
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,240
and and i'd add that um the problem is

1209
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,839
not business is changing their model

1210
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:18,160
it's the people right like

1211
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:20,078
it's not the businesses think that oh i

1212
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:22,240
switched from java to rails and so now

1213
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:23,280
you're doing rails instead of java

1214
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:25,040
that's fine

1215
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:26,880
the person who's forced to walk away

1216
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:29,359
from his java community because now

1217
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:32,160
it's his weekend time and he has kids

1218
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:34,240
and so he doesn't do weekend time

1219
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:37,040
and so that java community breaks apart

1220
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:38,560
because his boss has made a decision

1221
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:40,880
the business model for the company is

1222
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:42,240
fine it's the model for the human being

1223
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,960
and the community around that human

1224
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:45,839
being

1225
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:46,880
that has failed so i've got a question

1226
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:50,000
for luis uh

1227
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:52,000
okay right here did i understand you

1228
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,400
correctly that you're agreeing with mark

1229
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,359
that

1230
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:58,160
maybe licenses aren't the right vehicle

1231
00:41:55,359 --> 00:42:01,359
to support sustainability

1232
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:03,040
i'm staying in character so yes

1233
00:42:01,359 --> 00:42:04,560
licenses are totally a great way to

1234
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:08,800
support sustainability

1235
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:12,160
um i you know i i mean i think that

1236
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:12,720
um as i also in character said in the

1237
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:15,520
previous

1238
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:17,279
uh talk i think that there's probably

1239
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:18,800
some experimentation to be had there in

1240
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:20,240
a healthy way and i think there's

1241
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:22,319
probably a bit

1242
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:24,640
uh at least in some cases somewhat less

1243
00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:26,000
skepticism is warranted right like i see

1244
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:29,680
a lot of

1245
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:32,480
um you know in the case of the uh

1246
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:33,200
cryptographic autonomy license yes it is

1247
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:35,040
a company

1248
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:36,480
pushing this thing but it is also a

1249
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:37,440
thing that very clearly and very

1250
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:39,839
explicitly

1251
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:41,280
is about data right and everyone said oh

1252
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:42,880
no you're just a company trying to make

1253
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:44,480
sure that nobody else is ever using the

1254
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:46,400
thing it's like well

1255
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:48,400
actually they seem to be as best as i

1256
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:50,640
can i mean yes it's a company

1257
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:52,400
um but it's also a company that seems to

1258
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:53,118
want users to actually have access to

1259
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:55,520
data

1260
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:57,760
and so why are we so like hyper

1261
00:42:55,520 --> 00:43:00,960
aggressively

1262
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:01,680
uh when you know this is an attempt by a

1263
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:03,119
company

1264
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:04,960
as mark was saying this is an attempt by

1265
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:06,640
a company to actually adopt

1266
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:08,880
free software principles in i think the

1267
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:10,400
healthiest of ways and we've basically

1268
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:13,760
told them that they're well

1269
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:16,160
not we collectively but some of us uh

1270
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:17,599
have told the sponsors of that license

1271
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:20,960
that they're

1272
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:22,400
bad people which i i find unsupported by

1273
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:24,839
the evidence and i'm not just saying

1274
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:26,400
that because they're lawyers around here

1275
00:43:24,839 --> 00:43:28,640
somewhere

1276
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:29,599
so lewis you can stay in your character

1277
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:31,440
by saying that

1278
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:33,040
does first needs to tell sustainability

1279
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:36,000
yes but not with license

1280
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:36,720
you can stay in character right yeah i

1281
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,560
mean that's true

1282
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:40,720
right like you know i think the bottom

1283
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:42,720
line is

1284
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:45,118
you know to stay both stay in character

1285
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:49,040
and to be completely honest here right

1286
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:51,680
um it frustrates me when people say that

1287
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:54,480
the entire sustainability problem

1288
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:56,240
is a corporate problem when i have

1289
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:58,079
friends who don't attend fosdem anymore

1290
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:59,839
because they got burnt out

1291
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:01,680
right they were expected to do things on

1292
00:43:59,839 --> 00:44:02,880
weekends they were expected to do things

1293
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,839
when they could be spending time with

1294
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:05,680
their kids

1295
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:07,359
so they don't do open source anymore

1296
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:09,680
right and

1297
00:44:07,359 --> 00:44:10,640
like to say oh this is a business model

1298
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:13,200
problem like

1299
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:15,040
yeah you know yeah some of it is a

1300
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:17,439
business model problem but a lot of it

1301
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:21,119
is also a very deeply human problem

1302
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:23,440
and so to throw the english phrases

1303
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:26,480
throw the baby out with the bathwater

1304
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:29,440
um you know so yeah the

1305
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:30,720
i don't like the ss getting a little out

1306
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:31,520
of character here or somewhere in

1307
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:33,439
between

1308
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:34,960
i don't really like the sspl but to say

1309
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:36,480
there's no sustainability problem

1310
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:40,480
because you don't like the sspl

1311
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:42,800
is to confuse two related but distinct

1312
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:42,800
things

1313
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:46,240
okay i have a question this is coming

1314
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:48,560
from

1315
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:50,319
the openstreetmap space where we rely on

1316
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:53,119
volunteer mappers and

1317
00:44:50,319 --> 00:44:54,319
paid now a lot of paid contributors

1318
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:55,200
through a lot of companies are doing

1319
00:44:54,319 --> 00:44:56,720
mapping

1320
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:58,160
so what happens in your community when

1321
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:58,879
you know you started as a volunteer

1322
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:00,560
project

1323
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:02,240
and then some corporate contributors

1324
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:02,960
come in and they start to do a lot of

1325
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:05,279
the maintenance

1326
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:06,880
and contribute contribution and i guess

1327
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:09,359
this would be a question for you

1328
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:10,640
mark is it you know how sustainable can

1329
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:12,560
your community remain

1330
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:14,319
when that influence is still exerting

1331
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:18,160
itself and you can't just say

1332
00:45:14,319 --> 00:45:19,920
go do your own thing or listen to us

1333
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:21,359
so really it's when you've gotten the

1334
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:23,040
influx of

1335
00:45:21,359 --> 00:45:26,480
money from a large corporate contributor

1336
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:26,480
and you've grown to a certain size

1337
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:31,440
just resources just research just

1338
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:33,920
resources um

1339
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:35,119
well you know staying in character and

1340
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:37,200
and honestly too

1341
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:39,040
um you know for non-profits like that

1342
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:40,720
really is a problem and actually for

1343
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:42,560
profits as well right how do you manage

1344
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:45,598
your growth right it's probably uh

1345
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:46,400
i think depending upon what you're doing

1346
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:48,240
it's hard for

1347
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:49,599
for-profits to say oh we grew too

1348
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:51,279
quickly we regret that

1349
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:53,520
although sometimes they do sometimes

1350
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:54,960
they do i think it's a lot more real for

1351
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:56,560
non-profits because you really can

1352
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:58,560
collapse underneath your own weight if

1353
00:45:56,560 --> 00:46:00,799
you grow too quickly especially if

1354
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:02,078
um you know of resources showed up and

1355
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:03,359
then they suddenly disappeared and you

1356
00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:05,200
just kind of counted on it

1357
00:46:03,359 --> 00:46:06,400
and it's managing that i mean and i

1358
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:08,879
think that's a challenge for all

1359
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:10,560
non-profits regardless of

1360
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:12,400
of what they're doing right it's not

1361
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:14,480
just the free software problem

1362
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:16,240
if you're a non-profit and you suddenly

1363
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:17,760
get an influx of volunteers you have to

1364
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:18,160
ask like how dependent do you want to

1365
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:20,079
become

1366
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:21,839
on them and manage their contributions

1367
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:22,800
so that they do suddenly disappear one

1368
00:46:21,839 --> 00:46:24,319
day

1369
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:26,640
you either have a way of replacing those

1370
00:46:24,319 --> 00:46:28,560
resources or you have a way of scaling

1371
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:31,440
back down

1372
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:32,078
and can i add also in character um but

1373
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:35,119
also again

1374
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:36,880
honestly if you're thinking about it

1375
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:38,720
it helps to think about these things i

1376
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:40,880
find in a sustainability frame because

1377
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:42,640
if money just drops from the sky

1378
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:45,040
it can be super just and you're just

1379
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:47,200
like great money

1380
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:48,560
you know that that can be as mark said

1381
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:50,319
very disruptive

1382
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:52,000
um whereas if you think about it in

1383
00:46:50,319 --> 00:46:54,319
terms of like how are we building

1384
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:57,119
capacity how are we building human

1385
00:46:54,319 --> 00:46:58,480
capability in the long run which is in

1386
00:46:57,119 --> 00:47:00,400
part organizational and

1387
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:03,920
financial and but it's a big fractal

1388
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:05,359
thing and if you just treat it as like

1389
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:07,200
you know i mean as you know from the

1390
00:47:05,359 --> 00:47:07,920
openstreetmap community right it's not

1391
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:10,240
just like

1392
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:11,599
yeah it's millions more map data points

1393
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:13,680
but that is a two edge

1394
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:15,520
that has a super two-edged sword right

1395
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:17,759
fractal fractally edge sword is that a

1396
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:17,759
thing

1397
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:23,520
just to to the point which is too much

1398
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:26,960
money can really spoil

1399
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:28,240
things and i know of a few open source

1400
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:31,920
projects which are

1401
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:35,439
somewhat good at seeking funds

1402
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:37,200
and funding which have been basically

1403
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:38,880
funded and receiving grants several

1404
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:41,680
times for the same code

1405
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:43,440
and that's you know when there's a lot

1406
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:46,319
of money eventually that

1407
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:47,200
generates this kind of behaviors so it's

1408
00:47:46,319 --> 00:47:51,279
it's really

1409
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:55,118
something which can spoil the community

1410
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:55,920
and and the originally volunteer and

1411
00:47:55,119 --> 00:47:57,839
generous

1412
00:47:55,920 --> 00:48:00,160
gift of code that was made in the first

1413
00:47:57,839 --> 00:48:00,160
place

1414
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:07,280
hi gentlemen so first of all i want to

1415
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:09,118
thank the fine folks who've been

1416
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:11,040
running the microphones up and down all

1417
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:12,559
day um i know we've had a host of

1418
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:13,520
characters doing that and i'm very

1419
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:17,359
grateful so

1420
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:17,359
thank you to everyone for doing that

1421
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:21,279
um so i have two questions but the first

1422
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:24,960
one is the show of hands with

1423
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:26,960
super fast um how many of the folks

1424
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:28,319
up in the front of the room have done

1425
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:31,200
research into prior

1426
00:48:28,319 --> 00:48:32,640
art and sustainability such as the brunt

1427
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:34,078
land report and the corporate

1428
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:34,960
sustainability movement back in the

1429
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:38,079
1980s

1430
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:41,599
just show of hands one excellent

1431
00:48:38,079 --> 00:48:44,559
that is 25 more than i normally find um

1432
00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:45,200
so question number two you've spent the

1433
00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:46,880
last

1434
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:49,919
nearly 50 minutes up there talking about

1435
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:52,480
sustainability and i haven't yet heard

1436
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:52,960
anyone define what they mean on either

1437
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:55,359
side

1438
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:56,000
by sustainability could each side please

1439
00:48:55,359 --> 00:48:59,040
do that

1440
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:02,800
for us just to see whether you're even

1441
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:06,640
talking about the same thing

1442
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:08,000
in character so in character

1443
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:11,040
sustainability means

1444
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:14,079
finding all the technical uh

1445
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:15,040
financial human and let's say uh and

1446
00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:18,640
philosophical

1447
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:21,520
uh means to uh to accomplish

1448
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:23,200
your uh your your fate right so that's

1449
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:25,520
sustainability what you want to really

1450
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:25,520
deliver

1451
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:32,000
um i think we are taking the idea of

1452
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:35,919
sustainability from production of the

1453
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:35,920
continued production of free software

1454
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:44,710
yeah and in character i don't subscribe

1455
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:49,010
to the existence of sustainability

1456
00:49:44,710 --> 00:49:49,010
[Laughter]

1457
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:58,799
so this question is for lewis

1458
00:49:54,880 --> 00:50:00,800
conservancy for example has uh

1459
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:01,839
about we estimate something we in our

1460
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:04,559
member projects

1461
00:50:01,839 --> 00:50:05,680
have about uh 5 000 volunteers we

1462
00:50:04,559 --> 00:50:09,520
estimate

1463
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:10,160
and we pay about 120 contractors per

1464
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:12,720
year for

1465
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:13,839
software engineering work what should we

1466
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:17,439
be doing differently

1467
00:50:13,839 --> 00:50:18,880
why like what what is not sustainable

1468
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:21,200
about that

1469
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:22,079
um so i actually think that that's a

1470
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:25,200
pretty

1471
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:26,400
that that feels to me like a reasonably

1472
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:28,000
healthy ratio

1473
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:29,839
right like to me part of the

1474
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:33,839
sustainability puzzle

1475
00:50:29,839 --> 00:50:35,599
is how you uh balance that ratio

1476
00:50:33,839 --> 00:50:37,200
of paid people often doing

1477
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:38,880
infrastructure work often doing work

1478
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:40,799
that enables other people to do

1479
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:44,079
long-term things

1480
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:45,599
with healthy volunteerism right because

1481
00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:48,319
the most sustainable

1482
00:50:45,599 --> 00:50:50,160
long-term communities uh are those

1483
00:50:48,319 --> 00:50:52,400
communities that have that blend

1484
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:54,480
right that have people who can do some

1485
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:58,160
of the occasionally boring

1486
00:50:54,480 --> 00:51:01,040
but necessary stuff right um

1487
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:02,319
for example i got my professional start

1488
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:06,000
in open source

1489
00:51:02,319 --> 00:51:09,359
uh being it's a little bit of a gross

1490
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:10,240
oversimplification but sun indirectly

1491
00:51:09,359 --> 00:51:12,558
was paying me

1492
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:14,799
to do bug tracking work in the gnome

1493
00:51:12,559 --> 00:51:15,839
project so that we could get gnome 2.0

1494
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:18,160
out the door

1495
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:20,240
that was not something that people in

1496
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:23,279
the community were like

1497
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:24,879
chomping at the bits to like oh i just

1498
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:25,520
want to sit in front of the bug tracker

1499
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:28,480
all day

1500
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:30,079
right um i'm weird i actually did want

1501
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:30,880
to do that and then somebody paid me to

1502
00:51:30,079 --> 00:51:34,079
do it

1503
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:37,280
and critically i also built a community

1504
00:51:34,079 --> 00:51:38,160
around uh actually probably in a ratio

1505
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:41,839
fairly similar

1506
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:44,078
of one paid person to you know 20 30 40

1507
00:51:41,839 --> 00:51:45,839
at different times volunteers

1508
00:51:44,079 --> 00:51:47,440
many of whom went on to careers in open

1509
00:51:45,839 --> 00:51:50,480
source uh

1510
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:52,240
who were helping get that release out

1511
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:54,400
the door by understanding the qa

1512
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:58,000
right so if you were to tell me yeah i'm

1513
00:51:54,400 --> 00:52:01,200
paying 4 900 of those 5 000 people

1514
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:03,200
which is the ratio in some communities

1515
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:05,118
communities in quotes that's not very

1516
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:07,118
sustainable right because when the

1517
00:52:05,119 --> 00:52:08,800
companies involved decide

1518
00:52:07,119 --> 00:52:11,680
as in fact in the long run happened to

1519
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:14,000
gnome gnome had a very long hard period

1520
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:15,598
when it's corporate sponsors and the

1521
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,720
reason the gnome has continued to

1522
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:19,680
sustain

1523
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:21,520
is because it did have i think better

1524
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:22,879
than a lot of communities had a healthy

1525
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:24,160
community around those corporate

1526
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:27,119
contributions right

1527
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:29,520
so you want to be able to do both right

1528
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:30,880
and and that ratio like honestly not

1529
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:32,480
just an in character thing

1530
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:34,160
sounds to me like a pretty healthy one

1531
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:35,680
and i'm sure that you have individual

1532
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:37,200
projects within that

1533
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:38,879
where there's really only one or two

1534
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:42,078
people and they're all paid

1535
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:43,680
or there's maybe not right just numeric

1536
00:52:42,079 --> 00:52:46,720
like the odds are but if

1537
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:49,520
if not even better great so

1538
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:49,520
we oh

1539
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:57,280
it's quickly on my side so just

1540
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:59,279
saying that luis just conceded that his

1541
00:52:57,280 --> 00:53:01,839
kind of society carries the

1542
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:03,040
seeds of the demise of some of the

1543
00:53:01,839 --> 00:53:04,580
projects he wants to

1544
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:06,480
help being sustained

1545
00:53:04,580 --> 00:53:08,480
[Laughter]

1546
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:09,920
i would just say uh to to refer to your

1547
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:12,079
previous question

1548
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:14,160
being sustainable is not only surviving

1549
00:53:12,079 --> 00:53:16,240
right being sustainable is achieving the

1550
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:17,279
goals you set to yourself and we just

1551
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:20,000
answer if you're

1552
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:21,040
as a free free software conservancy you

1553
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:23,520
your fate is to

1554
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:24,319
have 5 000 contributors pay 120

1555
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:25,759
contractors

1556
00:53:24,319 --> 00:53:27,680
and it's enough to define your

1557
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:30,880
sustainability you're sustainable

1558
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:32,558
if it's 100 000 volunteers with i don't

1559
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:34,319
know 2000 contractors you're not yet

1560
00:53:32,559 --> 00:53:35,680
sustainable it's just the fate you want

1561
00:53:34,319 --> 00:53:36,880
to apply to yourself that define your

1562
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:38,558
sustainability model

1563
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:39,839
so surviving is not just being

1564
00:53:38,559 --> 00:53:40,880
sustainable for some people

1565
00:53:39,839 --> 00:53:42,799
unfortunately

1566
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:44,079
it is but for some people who have the

1567
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:46,160
chance to have better goals

1568
00:53:44,079 --> 00:53:48,160
your sustainability to match these goals

1569
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:49,759
right

1570
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:51,520
i mean if i can be super in character

1571
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:52,559
here uh sustainability is getting a

1572
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:56,480
lambo

1573
00:53:52,559 --> 00:53:59,280
um you know uh um

1574
00:53:56,480 --> 00:54:00,800
yeah i'll just leave with that so uh so

1575
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:02,079
within the session we've been doing

1576
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:03,599
questions at the end of each debate

1577
00:54:02,079 --> 00:54:05,440
rather than declaring a winner

1578
00:54:03,599 --> 00:54:06,800
um how many people learned something

1579
