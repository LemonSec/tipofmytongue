1
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,440
hi everybody

2
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:17,920
more to this side okay wait i'll move my

3
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:17,919
computer then

4
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:26,560
hi everybody i challenge you

5
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:31,119
the go community to end

6
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:32,600
fix solve once and for all

7
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:34,800
the discrimination and

8
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:39,320
under-representation of women

9
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:43,360
people of color people with disabilities

10
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:48,000
lgbtqia anybody

11
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:50,480
within one year that's all you get

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,480
one year

13
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:59,680
is it achievable i think so

14
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,800
i intend to show you that it probably is

15
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,840
if we moved

16
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:06,880
the conversation to a more pragmatic

17
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:10,960
um to more pragmatic solutions

18
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,960
discuss the how instead of the if

19
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:16,400
why a year because when you want to get

20
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,520
something done

21
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,720
you set a deadline don't like my

22
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,640
deadline

23
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,798
set your own but then you have to make

24
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,799
it

25
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:30,240
because we're not likely to discover

26
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:33,119
anything new next year

27
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:40,640
about this topic so why not just do

28
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:42,960
something now

29
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,640
so a little bit about me i'm rona and i

30
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:48,000
organize women who go berlin

31
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,640
i also um i also organize various

32
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,920
scholarship

33
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:55,280
programs for goldbridge um

34
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:57,920
i run my own mentoring program and

35
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,880
i'm mainly an engineer and i love people

36
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:02,479
opinions

37
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:04,079
code and data so naturally because

38
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:04,880
before giving this talk i checked to see

39
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:06,839
what kind of

40
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,239
impact i can expect from my own call to

41
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:11,360
action

42
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:12,959
according to science only 10 of you are

43
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,400
likely to take action after hearing my

44
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:17,440
talk

45
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:22,160
to those 10 percent thank you

46
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:23,840
you're actually all i need

47
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,920
if you implement some of the solutions

48
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:29,200
that i'm going to lay out today

49
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:32,799
or even come up with your own

50
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:35,839
other companies will take notice

51
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:38,080
so thank you very much in advance to the

52
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,599
remaining 90 percent

53
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,000
i made that number up so you have no

54
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:42,000
excuse

55
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,280
don't listen to people who say according

56
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:49,280
to science so why do i do what i do

57
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,920
in my entire career it's been 16 years i

58
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,480
reported to a woman

59
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,599
exactly once for a few months directly

60
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:01,359
for a few months

61
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:05,200
in 2004. it's been

62
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:06,720
almost 16 years and as i become more and

63
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,079
more senior it's likely to never happen

64
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,760
for me again unless i go

65
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,760
work for a very large company anybody

66
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:14,959
hiring

67
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,959
and get very lucky

68
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,000
and this is what that looks like in a

69
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:22,720
graph i call this work of art

70
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,720
the flatline

71
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,040
i can therefore summarize

72
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:36,399
mathematicians i can therefore summarize

73
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,319
my biggest concern with the tech world

74
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,120
especially startups back end and ops

75
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:43,040
with

76
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,040
really that's where the glass ceiling is

77
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:48,720
tech lead team lead the most junior

78
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:50,640
leadership positions

79
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,560
well it turns out that the glass ceiling

80
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:55,040
is even lower than that

81
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,840
according to hackerrank's woman women's

82
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,400
report

83
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:01,200
from 2018 women are by far likelier to

84
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,799
be in junior position than men

85
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,040
women as a gender are statistically

86
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:07,760
stuck in junior positions

87
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,560
some are truly stuck as juniors are not

88
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:11,040
promoted

89
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,640
not trained or promoted very slowly

90
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,519
combined with a very very serious

91
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,279
retention

92
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,959
problem where women across all levels

93
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:21,199
are constantly living

94
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:22,079
tech in fact according to a survey from

95
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:26,080
november

96
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:27,680
2018 from indeed

97
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,919
the leading reasons for women to live

98
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:33,040
tech were lack of career growth

99
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:34,719
poor management so slow salary growth

100
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:37,440
lack of challenge if you can believe

101
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,960
that and lack of work-life balance now

102
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,240
this is the multiple selections as you

103
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:43,680
can see it adds to more than

104
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:45,919
100 so lack of

105
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,919
work-life balance was actually expected

106
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:50,240
to be higher on the list

107
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:52,159
and this is surprising now if you take

108
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,560
all of those items we can do something

109
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,080
about

110
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:57,600
everything on it

111
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:00,960
so i can share countless stories to

112
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,960
explain how we got to this point

113
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:07,680
and i have researches coming out of my

114
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:10,080
ears but i only have 25 minutes

115
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:12,160
sorry call for papers committee for

116
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:14,960
having to review my paper with all the

117
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:17,759
data that i have on this topic

118
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:19,039
um so i want to focus instead today on

119
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:20,639
one message

120
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:22,719
that like you i'm in the business of

121
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:23,280
solving problems and this is one that we

122
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:27,120
can

123
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:30,000
solve i am after on an engineer

124
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,840
and this is what i do for a living so we

125
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,479
conceal it using the same methodologies

126
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:36,320
that we use to solve everything else

127
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:37,758
it's simple to understand it's simple to

128
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,280
break down

129
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:40,880
we can experiment and monitor our

130
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,880
progress and all

131
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:45,440
what else does a good troubleshooter

132
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:47,680
actually need

133
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,120
so why am i coming to you with this

134
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:52,479
simple

135
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:54,560
the go community is modern

136
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:56,400
as a community we have set aside

137
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,800
paradigms that have shaped programming

138
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,960
for three plus decades

139
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:06,720
change our perspective and adapted to a

140
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:10,159
new way of doing things

141
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,160
to a new way of doing things

142
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:16,960
we are not here to serve the language

143
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:20,000
the language is there to serve us

144
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:21,280
so that makes me wonder why why our

145
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,319
variables

146
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:28,479
deserve a safe space

147
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:28,479
but our underrepresented groups don't

148
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:32,960
and what would happen if we treated

149
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:36,080
ourselves as seriously

150
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,080
as we tweet our code

151
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,319
so let's examine the current state of

152
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,960
diversity in the go community

153
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:47,120
this statistic i took from the from the

154
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:50,000
stack overflows

155
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:52,160
survey of 2019 i selected the responders

156
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,919
that worked with go in the past year

157
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,919
and this is their gender breakdown

158
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,840
and this is the breakdown of their

159
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,960
ethnicities and i remind you this is a

160
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,719
global survey

161
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:07,120
in europe the situation is a lot more

162
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:09,120
dire i couldn't bring myself to bring

163
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,880
you the situation in the eu because i

164
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,120
couldn't take away united kingdom just

165
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,120
yet

166
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:18,719
i just decided not to so a disclaimer

167
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:21,759
most of my talk is going to be

168
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:23,039
based on data um about women

169
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:25,840
about the underworld presentation of

170
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:27,120
women in tech i'd love to be able to

171
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,520
talk more about

172
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,680
the realities that other groups face but

173
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:34,960
sadly there's just not enough data

174
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:36,240
on that i believe that some of the

175
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,719
information that i'm going to lay out

176
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,080
today

177
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:41,280
is relevant to them as well so on a side

178
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,800
note

179
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,000
i also want to point out something that

180
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,400
i think is not addressed enough

181
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,639
diversity is not equality

182
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:50,239
and a diverse theme is not necessarily

183
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:52,080
an equal opportunity team and i think it

184
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,520
goes to the core of the problem

185
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:58,240
where people do not want to be the

186
00:07:53,520 --> 00:08:00,878
tokens of our diversity

187
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,800
so let's break down the problem women

188
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:06,080
live tech

189
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:08,240
while we're pursuing engineers

190
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:10,159
whose problem is it well it's very easy

191
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,479
to think that it's my problem

192
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,520
or people who care you know the

193
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:15,840
ideologists

194
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,440
the activists but i argue it's our

195
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:20,560
problem as a community

196
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:22,240
first because we're business driven

197
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:25,280
and currently we're paying recruiters a

198
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:27,840
fortune when there's probably available

199
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,840
talent

200
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,880
how do we know there's available talent

201
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:35,120
depending on where you live

202
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:37,200
60 to 80 percent of the population is

203
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,679
not represented

204
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,959
is not participating it's the vast

205
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:44,399
majority

206
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:45,920
of course there's talent and second

207
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,720
because diversity is reported to

208
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,160
increase

209
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,480
individual success while improving

210
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:52,240
creativity and eventual growth

211
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:55,360
so at the very least we're not

212
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:57,760
benefiting there

213
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,120
so now that we understand the problem

214
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:02,080
let's fix it

215
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:03,839
what were to happen if we were to create

216
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:07,760
a trello card

217
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:11,360
for diversity and add it to our tasks

218
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:11,360
what would that trello card look like

219
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:15,120
the reason i'm turning this into a

220
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:16,000
trello card is because if any of our

221
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,080
products

222
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,640
was failing with women and minorities or

223
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:23,600
the vast majority of the population

224
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:25,040
we would have uh solutions with a b

225
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,920
tests in production

226
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:29,120
within a month there is no way that we

227
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:31,279
would let this go

228
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,800
except we do have a failing product it

229
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:35,040
just happens to be the positions that we

230
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:37,199
cannot fill

231
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,719
so we are very very we should be very

232
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:41,440
incentivized to fix this

233
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,440
once and for all

234
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,320
so let's start with the biggest funnel

235
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,800
everybody complains

236
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,720
they don't get cvs from women they are

237
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,719
simply not applying

238
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,560
and you've probably heard about this one

239
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:58,000
a highly quoted hp

240
00:09:54,560 --> 00:10:00,640
internals research um has

241
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,360
uh reported that women apply to jobs

242
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:04,399
only if they

243
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:07,440
meet 100 of the criteria versus men

244
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:10,880
with only sixty percent of the criteria

245
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,880
i'm happy to call bs

246
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:16,079
first a little bit background this is

247
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:18,800
known as the confidence gap

248
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:19,680
um between men and women and it's

249
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,479
amazing because

250
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:23,920
hp apparently were able to put a number

251
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:27,200
on the difference on the comp

252
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:31,120
on the confidence gap 40 percent

253
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:33,279
40 massive right might as well be 100

254
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,800
percent

255
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:37,120
so i'm happy to inform you that this

256
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:39,120
statistics is probably not scientific

257
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,160
first there is no one hundred percent in

258
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,320
any uh

259
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:44,719
real serious research it just doesn't

260
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,720
exist

261
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:50,720
two if the hp research even exists

262
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,560
it has never been published anywhere

263
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,800
um we don't know who conducted it we

264
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:01,439
don't know what they asked we don't know

265
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:02,560
who they asked

266
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,560
and we don't know if it was

267
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:07,119
peer-reviewed we know nothing about it

268
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:10,000
except it went viral

269
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:13,360
so please do not continue telling

270
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,120
everybody about this okay

271
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:16,959
however there seems to be some consensus

272
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:20,079
in the industry that women truly don't

273
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:21,518
apply uh as easily to uh to jobs as men

274
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:22,719
and there have been real studies for

275
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:25,839
instance the one that was

276
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:28,720
um that was done was conducted by

277
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:30,240
dannings and erlinger the same dunning

278
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:33,200
from the kruger dunning effect

279
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:34,000
if you're familiar and they asked men

280
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,240
and women

281
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,200
to guess how much they scored in a test

282
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:40,399
and women

283
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:43,839
did underestimate their scores

284
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:43,839
more than men

285
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,719
so a woman named tara sophia moore

286
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:51,120
decided to ask men and women

287
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,079
if you decided not to apply for a job

288
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,360
because you didn't meet all the

289
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:56,479
qualifications

290
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,440
why didn't you apply and her results

291
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,720
were probably

292
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:02,240
more published than harvard business

293
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,240
review and they are interesting

294
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:06,160
she gave them five options to choose

295
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:07,920
from not all of them are important so

296
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,439
i'm just going to read them quickly

297
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:11,199
i don't think you they would ha i didn't

298
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,800
think they would hire me and i didn't

299
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,959
and i didn't want to waste my time and

300
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,240
energy i didn't think they would hire me

301
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:18,638
and i didn't want to put myself out

302
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:20,240
there in case i fail

303
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:22,480
i was being respectful of the time and

304
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,639
preferences of the person

305
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,839
reviewing applications they had already

306
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:28,959
made clear

307
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:31,120
who they were looking for and i didn't

308
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:33,040
think i could do the job well

309
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,399
i was following the guidelines about who

310
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:37,519
should apply

311
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:40,399
so very good news the least

312
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:42,399
common answer for women was that they

313
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:44,399
didn't think they could do the job well

314
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:45,920
that is not why they didn't apply or at

315
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:47,360
least not the leading reason why they

316
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:50,399
didn't apply

317
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:53,839
it was similar to men 12.4 percent but

318
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:53,839
lower we can rejoice in that

319
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:59,119
so moore explains people who weren't

320
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,240
applying believe they needed the

321
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,720
qualifications

322
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,920
not to do the job well but to be hired

323
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,040
in the first place

324
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:08,479
they thought that the required

325
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:10,399
qualifications were well required

326
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,760
so now to be completely fair we cannot

327
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:13,040
say for sure

328
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,480
that they thought they could do they

329
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,199
were confident they could do the job

330
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,720
well

331
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,240
but it is not the reason why they are

332
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,959
not applying

333
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,519
and in a troubleshooting world more is

334
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:24,239
right

335
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:24,720
this is a lead and we can try and poke

336
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,399
it

337
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,800
and see what kind of results we can get

338
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,800
from it

339
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:35,279
so i propose a few solutions

340
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:37,279
eliminate everything that can be learned

341
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:40,240
in two days or even a week

342
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:41,600
it probably doesn't matter and if the

343
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,279
applicants

344
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:48,560
don't know the technology they don't

345
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:51,439
know how easy it is to learn

346
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:52,880
why not experiment post multiple ads

347
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:55,279
with multiple profiles and see who

348
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:57,040
applies to what

349
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:59,839
at some point you've accumulated a bunch

350
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:02,719
of cvs not all of them meet 100

351
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:04,639
of your criteria look at the least

352
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,399
common denominator of the applicants

353
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:07,360
that you're currently considering it's

354
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:09,839
probably

355
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:12,560
the profile you're seeking anyway and

356
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:12,560
repost the ad

357
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:16,639
and you should probably rethink all the

358
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:19,440
superlatives killer programmer is

359
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:20,320
pretty obvious but what about ninja or

360
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,600
rockstar

361
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:26,800
instead of we're hiring the best why not

362
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,800
we'll turn you into the best

363
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:31,800
and while we're on the topic of

364
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:34,880
confidence it's being addressed

365
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:36,000
disproportionately imposter syndrome the

366
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:38,320
self-doubt

367
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,399
uh all of these are well documented and

368
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:43,040
uh discussed very often

369
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:44,160
uh but i have not found found a single

370
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:46,719
research

371
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:49,680
showing that if they applied they'd

372
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:52,000
actually get the job

373
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:53,760
so what if women statistically are not

374
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,399
likely to get the job with the infamous

375
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:58,560
60

376
00:14:54,399 --> 00:15:01,279
of the criteria what if women

377
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:03,279
what if when a woman asks for a salary

378
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:04,560
similar to a man's

379
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:06,880
she wouldn't get the job in the first

380
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,880
place

381
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,240
so i know we all think that we're the

382
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:11,040
one good employer that doesn't

383
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,760
discriminate

384
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:16,399
but how is she supposed to know that and

385
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,399
in advance

386
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:21,199
and i'm not the only one saying this

387
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:24,000
several studies have already shown

388
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:24,560
that women's self-promotion is tied to

389
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,839
fear

390
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:32,079
of backlash for overconfidence over

391
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:35,360
confidence so what about degrees

392
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:37,920
most dads begin with

393
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:40,000
with a bachelor's degree qualification

394
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:41,599
and there's a real problem with that

395
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,600
we know there's discrimination in

396
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:46,000
education system towards all

397
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,040
underrepresented groups mainly people of

398
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,320
color

399
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:52,959
women lgbtq

400
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:56,240
everybody campuses are not famous for

401
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:56,239
being particularly safe

402
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:00,560
and young girls are silent are silenced

403
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:03,839
in classes

404
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:05,439
worldwide this is a worldwide phenomenon

405
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:07,519
so if we were to consider everything

406
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,000
that we're doing we might want to look

407
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:10,560
into that

408
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,560
one as well

409
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:14,959
and finally since women leave tech in

410
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:17,199
masses

411
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:19,279
if we're actively looking for a senior

412
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:21,839
we're not likely

413
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:23,920
to uh to even get cvs from

414
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:26,399
underrepresented groups

415
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:27,040
and we're not likely to uh recruit them

416
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:28,959
in the end

417
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:31,120
so the statistics is just not on our

418
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:33,920
side and it's impossible

419
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:35,360
that everybody only hires seniors 100 of

420
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:37,279
the time

421
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,560
so i challenge you then to do one

422
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:40,800
additional thing

423
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:43,199
every time you say go is simple hire a

424
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,199
junior

425
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,320
so next on our trello card is defining

426
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:54,000
goals to our recruiters

427
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,360
especially if you're using external

428
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,360
recruiters

429
00:16:55,360 --> 00:17:00,160
you must set some expectations i'll

430
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:01,680
explain external recruiters are paid a

431
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:05,119
margin

432
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:07,359
if they think that a man

433
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:08,639
is likely to get a job they will send

434
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:12,240
you men

435
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:13,439
if they think that a man is likely to be

436
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:17,199
paid better

437
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:18,559
they will send you men so we must

438
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:20,480
create an incentive for them to

439
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:22,000
encourage diversity

440
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:24,079
and whether you're using internal or

441
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,119
external recruiters you can define some

442
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:26,799
quotas

443
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:28,559
on the amounts of cvs that you're

444
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:30,879
expecting

445
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:32,000
and this will allow you to also see what

446
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:35,280
kind of cvs were being

447
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:38,559
passed over so far

448
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:41,200
so back to a trello card go to meetups

449
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:43,120
find your applicants where they are when

450
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:45,600
i started organizing women who go berlin

451
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:47,760
i didn't wait for people to come

452
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:50,799
i went everywhere women who code women

453
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:53,280
tech makers get carried girls

454
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:55,679
and i unlike you didn't have money to

455
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:59,280
offer them to learn go

456
00:17:55,679 --> 00:18:01,919
so you can be more more convincing

457
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:04,000
and i got this question a lot ronna we

458
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:07,679
love what you're doing

459
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,679
how can we support you better

460
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:17,918
hire my goddamn members that's how

461
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:21,440
so next on our list is coding challenges

462
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:23,840
and they started as uh with the thought

463
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:25,120
that you might overlook someone because

464
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,480
they don't have the experience you're

465
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,719
looking for

466
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,240
so there were supposed to be a way to

467
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,360
allow applicants to surprise you and

468
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:34,080
it's a fine idea

469
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:35,678
it really is however companies are now

470
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,960
sending out challenges that take days or

471
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:40,240
even weeks to complete

472
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:42,720
and we need to revise this process

473
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,679
here's why and this is true to probably

474
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,360
all parents

475
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:47,280
but especially women and especially to

476
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,879
mothers with babies

477
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:51,520
a young working mother can maybe

478
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:54,240
allocate four to five hours a week

479
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:55,679
to complete a challenge and she's

480
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,120
probably applying to other places as

481
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:58,480
well

482
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,918
so if you're sending so if your

483
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,600
challenge cannot be complete within four

484
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:04,320
to five hours and i mean

485
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:06,159
four to five hours not sprint points no

486
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:08,000
t-shirt sizes

487
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:10,799
five four to five hours you've probably

488
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,320
no business sending it to anyone

489
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:14,080
but i'll take it a step further because

490
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:16,960
now you're telling yourself hours takes

491
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:18,399
only two hours to complete

492
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,760
if you're sending out the challenge with

493
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:22,240
the expectation that you're going to

494
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:26,320
hire the person whose solution stand out

495
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:29,600
stands out that is a function of

496
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:33,120
time and resources and our young working

497
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:33,120
mother again cannot compete

498
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:39,039
so this is where

499
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:42,160
we implicitly prefer young people

500
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:43,840
younger people with no commitments

501
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:45,840
so consider this people are likely to

502
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:46,720
have children after spending a few years

503
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:49,120
in the industry

504
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:51,039
after have been have been built a career

505
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:54,320
so we might be eliminating people at the

506
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:54,320
primes of their careers

507
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:58,799
our next item is of course retention

508
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,360
let's retain

509
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:04,080
our hires because otherwise we didn't

510
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:05,918
achieve anything

511
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:07,840
code reviews are a great way to build

512
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:09,760
and destroy trust between colleagues

513
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:12,480
so make sure to have constructive code

514
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,480
review process

515
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:16,559
and this one is really important

516
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:18,158
training education budget and

517
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:19,840
conferences so we see this everywhere

518
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:21,520
conference is

519
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:23,039
have to allocate diversity tickets to

520
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:25,440
underrepresented groups

521
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:27,039
and then people like me distribute them

522
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:29,120
set a clear budget

523
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:32,080
and let your employees decide how they

524
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:32,080
are going to spend it

525
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:37,520
finally define a clear path to promotion

526
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,520
give your employees a sense of

527
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:40,320
opportunity create a mentoring program

528
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,559
in your

529
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:43,439
organization scheduled performance

530
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:46,639
evaluation

531
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:48,799
scheduled races raises uh you don't have

532
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:50,320
to wait to be asked if you value your

533
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:52,480
employees

534
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:54,639
and consider also anonymizing the cv

535
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:56,799
process and your coding challenges if

536
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:58,320
you choose to keep them

537
00:20:56,799 --> 00:21:00,320
and let's talk about the thumbs up

538
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:01,918
process

539
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:03,520
over the past 15 years companies have

540
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:06,400
been making interview processes

541
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:07,918
uh harder and longer and if you if

542
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:10,720
before you would interview

543
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:12,240
with uh two maybe three people today

544
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,919
you're likely to be

545
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:16,240
interviewed by at least four to six

546
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:17,360
people and they all have to give the

547
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:20,000
thumbs up

548
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:23,840
but we just doubled the chances that one

549
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,840
of your interviewers is biased

550
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:29,840
so finally people should feel safe at

551
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:32,480
work

552
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:35,120
physically and emotionally if you have

553
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:38,320
any kind of bullying at work

554
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:41,678
on any background any background end it

555
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:43,439
is inexcusable figure it out

556
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:45,520
and here's the promise trello card with

557
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:47,520
all of the ideas i just explained

558
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:48,639
this is not everything you might come up

559
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:50,480
with your own ideas

560
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:52,480
and if you do please share them back

561
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,679
with me share it with you tell your

562
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,919
friends your recruiters

563
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:59,840
and your managers be brave and thank you

564
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:59,840
very much

565
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:13,840
cool so we have some time for questions

566
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:13,840
so any questions in the audience

567
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,200
you're really far

568
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,158
excuse me

569
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:30,320
thank you for coming this way yes

570
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:32,480
nope come here okay all right

571
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:34,000
all right um so first a short disclaimer

572
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,840
like i'm white cis

573
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,600
and a man so i'm obviously very

574
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:39,039
privileged to even talk about anything

575
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:41,439
in this subject

576
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:42,799
i don't consider myself a particular

577
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:45,679
defender of the cause

578
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:46,960
but i try to help whenever i can and one

579
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:48,799
thing that come up

580
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,720
pretty often for me is that whenever i

581
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:51,679
start any discussion in in this area

582
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,840
it's like

583
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:55,360
it's very hard to to point out what

584
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,320
problem you're trying to solve like why

585
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:58,320
is it a problem

586
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:59,360
like i kind of see it for me but it's

587
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:01,439
really hard for me to

588
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:03,120
convince someone that just shrugs and

589
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,480
said yeah why is it my problem why

590
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:06,639
should i even care

591
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:08,240
right so do you have any like short and

592
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,720
to the point arguments that could help

593
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,000
me and

594
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,360
when i'm in this sort of discussion to

595
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,240
say hey look this is something that we

596
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,918
should try to

597
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:15,600
solve if even if we're in a very

598
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:18,880
privileged position and don't see

599
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:21,918
it as a day-to-day problem

600
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:23,520
well wonder is the recruitment so i can

601
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:24,720
tell you that i mentored about a hundred

602
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:26,720
people to date

603
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:28,080
and they're all incredibly talented and

604
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:30,720
i'm enjoying a select

605
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:33,039
uh what's called the select uh selection

606
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:34,480
bias

607
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:36,158
where all the people who are brave

608
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,600
enough to come to me and ask for help

609
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:39,120
are incredibly talented and probably

610
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,799
could make it on their own

611
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:42,239
so think about this if you started your

612
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:44,559
own mentoring program you could probably

613
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:46,320
hire 100 people tomorrow

614
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:48,559
that would be incredibly talented and

615
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:51,600
very very good that is one

616
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:53,600
two my first job was actually and this

617
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:55,439
was 2003 was i was doing c

618
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,959
plus plus and at some point we were a

619
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:58,799
majority of women

620
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:00,720
to me it's a no-brainer because i know

621
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:03,360
what that workplace looked like

622
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:04,480
and it was quite amazing and i mean i

623
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,080
understand that people speak from

624
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,720
experience and do not understand what a

625
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,720
diverse

626
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:11,440
workplace is and therefore do not

627
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:13,039
understand necessarily the necessity

628
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:14,880
they will just figure it out along the

629
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:19,840
way because it is nicer

630
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:19,840
it is just nicer

631
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:26,480
for the people in the back we can hear

632
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:26,480
you perfectly from here

633
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:31,600
thanks so much of the the things you

634
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:34,240
mentioned

635
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,879
are about the hiring process but you

636
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,960
didn't

637
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,919
say a lot about actually the education

638
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,760
problem right

639
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:42,159
there are a lot less women actually

640
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:45,520
studying computer science and such

641
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:47,360
can you elaborate about that please

642
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:49,279
so this this changes from country to

643
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:51,918
country and

644
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:52,400
but we see worldwide a worldwide friend

645
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:56,240
that

646
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:59,360
uh the women do sign up less

647
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:00,400
those are uh those studies are also hard

648
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:03,760
to get to

649
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:04,960
and if you are so okay a curious thing

650
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,799
like do i have uh

651
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:08,240
how long do i have okay i have one

652
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:10,400
minute i have one minute

653
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:11,919
i have one minute okay i'll try to make

654
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,120
it short in my country in my home

655
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:14,559
country i come from israel there's

656
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:17,840
something called the psychometry

657
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:20,879
it's an internal it's in it it's um

658
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:23,360
when you try to enter uh the uh

659
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,559
the university you have to do that it

660
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:26,240
weighs 50

661
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:28,559
of the score that is actually going to

662
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:31,360
send you to the university

663
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:32,158
women do pretty well for 12 years in my

664
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:34,080
own country

665
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:35,840
do pretty well and do way better and

666
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:39,760
have better grades than men

667
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:42,959
during the 12 years men do better

668
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:45,679
on the psychometric exams

669
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:46,799
why 50 i'm always puzzled like why not

670
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:48,880
40

671
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:50,400
why not 80 if you're sure that it's

672
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:52,320
really that important or it's more

673
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,679
important or it's as important as 12

674
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:55,840
years of grades

675
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:58,559
why not that those things are so

676
00:25:55,840 --> 00:26:01,199
arbitrary that we don't even see them

677
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:03,039
that's the answer basically like we need

678
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,640
to poke at to every

679
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:06,320
every step of the way and understand

680
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:08,640
what decisions we've made

681
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:09,439
and nobody is ever going to change that

682
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:12,080
you know

683
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:13,440
nobody like this is not even nobody's

684
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:15,600
thinking about these things

685
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:17,279
so that's the problem and i'm just going

686
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,879
to go away now because i'm being kicked

687
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:25,840
out

688
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:25,840
thanks so much

689
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,840
you
