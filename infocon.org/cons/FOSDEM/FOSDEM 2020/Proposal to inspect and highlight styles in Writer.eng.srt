1
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,400
so you're here to

2
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:13,599
talk or to listen about styles which is

3
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:17,279
a great feature of

4
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:20,560
writer and most of you

5
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:25,080
may know reports

6
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:28,000
these are from from our support platform

7
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:31,839
ask.libreoffice.org people who

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:36,140
ask about styles how to apply how

9
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:38,079
to work with it why is my style not

10
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:41,200
[Music]

11
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:42,840
not effective anymore what can i do to

12
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:47,680
copy and paste

13
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:51,199
um problems issues with understanding

14
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:55,120
there are millions because

15
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:55,120
of course writer is used in a

16
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:01,680
broad

17
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,398
the area and many people from the very

18
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,199
beginner

19
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:05,920
up to the experts are using it and

20
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:08,560
everyone

21
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:10,080
is recommended to use dyes and that's

22
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:13,200
what we propagate

23
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:16,158
we try to educate people to use styles

24
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,080
but in the end they struggle with it

25
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,799
they struggle with the understanding we

26
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,840
can

27
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:24,479
of course they it is a question of

28
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,479
documentation it's a question a matter

29
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:29,039
of learning and

30
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:30,479
you have to make yourself familiar with

31
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:34,960
software to use it

32
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:39,439
but on the other hand it is also

33
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:43,280
a difficult situation reason here

34
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:46,320
why people one reason why people then

35
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:48,720
understand is that the styles

36
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:51,679
have some kind of hierarchy you can

37
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:54,720
define a paragraph style with a

38
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,200
yellow background a character style with

39
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:59,119
black

40
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,960
red background and put that on your text

41
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:02,399
and add a direct formatting and you get

42
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:06,158
a completely different

43
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:09,840
color if this happens people are

44
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,840
confused of course

45
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:16,879
so what does it mean we need

46
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,519
a couple of requirements how can we deal

47
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:20,840
with it

48
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:22,080
beyond good documentation beyond

49
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:25,920
education

50
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:28,640
one is um we take uh baxilla

51
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,920
the the request from user as basis for

52
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:33,440
what

53
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:36,559
the uh we need in the program

54
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:39,920
and one request that it's worth

55
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:44,239
to discuss is a display of inherited

56
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:47,200
attributes if you use a style

57
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:49,440
inherit from a parent then you get

58
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,679
different attributes and that has to be

59
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:55,359
displayed in a proper way

60
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:57,200
i don't go through all the uh the text

61
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,120
it's not so important i just want to

62
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,839
show that we have

63
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,879
many tickets many requests enhancement

64
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:06,000
requests

65
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:08,799
what to do the

66
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,200
identification what is effective right

67
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,959
now

68
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:18,399
is an important feature

69
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:21,519
also the removal

70
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:25,040
if the style gets

71
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:28,239
changes to the parent you cannot remove

72
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:31,760
any change you you just add on top more

73
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:34,879
if you use a certain font

74
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:36,480
in the derived style it is of course

75
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:39,920
different but setting it back

76
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:43,518
to the style from the parent

77
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:44,720
does not unset this property this

78
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:48,159
attribute

79
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:51,359
so if the parent changes the changed one

80
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:53,599
in the children will remain there

81
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:56,080
you need something to delete it and the

82
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:58,480
last one here is

83
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:00,480
nesting character styles that adds a

84
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:03,840
little bit more complexity

85
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:05,359
to the situation right now you can have

86
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:08,400
one character style

87
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,040
and apply character style to text like

88
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:13,920
say

89
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:14,560
emphasize to make the the text in italic

90
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:18,320
the

91
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:21,600
format allows to have more than one

92
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:23,919
character styles the request here called

93
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,040
nested characters that means more than

94
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:27,039
one multiple

95
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:29,840
character styles so you can have a bold

96
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:33,600
italic and underlined

97
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:37,758
all three different character styles

98
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,759
to one part of the text

99
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,160
putting all these together in a nutshell

100
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,639
we have

101
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,160
two requirements eve wants to get an

102
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,400
overview of the

103
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,520
formatting to understand the actual

104
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:53,758
layout eve

105
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:55,680
is our persona for the advanced user

106
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:57,199
and eve wants to remove individual

107
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:01,280
properties

108
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:04,479
that's all pretty simple what can we do

109
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:07,599
actually we have some

110
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:08,479
something like this the paragraph style

111
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,680
has

112
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:15,120
in the organizer tab and

113
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,120
section what

114
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:22,560
formatting this style contains in

115
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,039
relation to the parent in this case text

116
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:27,360
body

117
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:30,719
it is yellow and something else is set

118
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:33,840
and at this position we can solve the

119
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:37,440
removal problem easily we can click

120
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:40,880
on the x here let's see it's a text

121
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:42,719
to remove the um removes the attribute

122
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:45,360
it is just one part of the game

123
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,560
i will not talk further about removal

124
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:50,400
but

125
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:54,240
the id here is taken into the

126
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:57,440
actual proposal it is a new deck

127
00:05:54,240 --> 00:06:00,800
that we could introduce should introduce

128
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:04,960
a deck at the sidebar that lists

129
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:08,240
all the styles in the tree

130
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:12,159
and starting with the

131
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:15,360
the topmost style and of course default

132
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:18,319
um it would show only

133
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,039
those attributes from the per from the

134
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:21,600
parent

135
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:22,800
that have changed it shouldn't be too

136
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,680
many

137
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:28,080
in this case font name identitation

138
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:32,160
alignment and so on

139
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:32,800
to avoid too many information on one

140
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,240
side

141
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,360
i'd suggest to collapse starting with a

142
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,560
certain number

143
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:41,360
that means default with no parents would

144
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:45,520
have

145
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:48,000
all the um the attributes a style have

146
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:49,840
listed hundreds or maybe not hundreds

147
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,639
but a lot

148
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:53,280
it is collapsed all the time as shown

149
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:55,919
here

150
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:57,280
but you can open it in this case the

151
00:06:55,919 --> 00:07:00,719
user has derived

152
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:02,719
another style from text body using at

153
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:05,599
this particular situation

154
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:07,199
it is with a font size and 12 and

155
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:09,680
language in french

156
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:11,840
so it's a french guy writing a thesis

157
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:14,960
based on the text body

158
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:18,080
makes quite sense the goal

159
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:21,520
is to see clearly what is applied

160
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:26,080
and it happens that you

161
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:28,719
define a attribute in one

162
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:31,039
part of the game in the characters

163
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:35,280
paragraph style here text buddy

164
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:38,400
and overwrite it with some other

165
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:41,198
features that you have font name

166
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,000
for example is overwritten by the font

167
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:45,520
name

168
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:48,639
and to cover this suggestion is to

169
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:50,799
gray out those attributes that are

170
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:52,479
changed in relation to the parent so

171
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:55,520
they have to get listed

172
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:56,840
but they are not they do not apply to

173
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,680
the current

174
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:03,440
selection the sidebar

175
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:12,879
shows the situation that it's a cursor

176
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:16,960
so what is being focused is listed here

177
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:21,199
and on the character style

178
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:24,799
it's showing the example with a multiple

179
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:26,000
character styles in this case emphasize

180
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:29,680
and strong emphasize

181
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,599
is applied to the text and you get more

182
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:34,880
than one

183
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:34,880
entry in the list

184
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:38,959
i think it's pretty clear and

185
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:43,200
straightforward and

186
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:46,959
the goal is to i hope it allows users to

187
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:50,320
more easily understand what styles mean

188
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:50,319
and what um

189
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:58,480
why a certain appearance happens

190
00:08:54,959 --> 00:09:01,760
right now but it's just one part

191
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:05,680
of the trouble

192
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:07,839
the other is that you not

193
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,719
clearly know from from the whole

194
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:13,200
document

195
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:16,320
what happens in in the in all pages

196
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:19,440
then you see only the

197
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:21,360
style or the attributes at the cursor

198
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,920
you don't get an overview for the full

199
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:27,680
document the request here is a style

200
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,680
indicator and document margin

201
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:31,680
people request to highlight direct

202
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:33,920
formatting that's

203
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:35,839
the reason to look through all the

204
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,920
documents you want to clean up the

205
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:39,920
document and remove all the direct

206
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:43,120
formattings maybe you want to

207
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:44,240
see if all the text body style that you

208
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:47,279
want to use

209
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:50,480
in the example before the

210
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:51,439
the thesis text style if you have

211
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:56,160
applied it to

212
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:59,360
really all the paragraphs

213
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:04,160
and reveal codes is

214
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:08,800
an example from perfect in a word

215
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:12,000
styles you want to get an overview

216
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:14,959
and change those styles that you

217
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,959
mistakenly applied

218
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:22,160
that could be done

219
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:26,480
later first of all

220
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:30,319
i suggest to combine paragraph styles

221
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:32,640
these left-hand paragraph styles

222
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,519
in the sidebar and character styles in

223
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:37,120
sidebar

224
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:39,279
are right now separated into two fuse

225
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,560
this toggle buttons toggle buttons here

226
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:42,800
on top

227
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:45,439
and you have to switch between paragraph

228
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:47,519
style and character style you don't see

229
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,720
what's going on on the other side the

230
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:52,240
proposal is to

231
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:55,440
combine it into one sidebar call it

232
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:56,720
text styles of course show the paragraph

233
00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:00,720
styles and

234
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:04,800
the character styles

235
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:07,680
together then as styles and to expose

236
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:10,000
the hierarchical view as a different

237
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:12,640
kind of

238
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,399
visualization and not a kind of filter

239
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:17,519
right now we have a filter

240
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:20,240
show the hidden styles show all

241
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:21,519
applied styles show only document styles

242
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:25,360
and so on

243
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:29,839
it makes not much sense to have a way to

244
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:29,839
show it like the hierarchical

245
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:39,120
view with all the filtering mechanism

246
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:42,399
that's to expose the hidden and

247
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:44,720
hierarchical view into check boxes so

248
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:46,560
you can always switch it on and off

249
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:50,480
and all the other filters go into there

250
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:50,479
or remain in the drop down

251
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:55,200
at the bottom that's the interesting

252
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:59,120
part here

253
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:01,600
you get one checkbox shows a

254
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:04,240
highlight the styles in the document

255
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:08,240
that could look like this

256
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:12,079
document margin receives a

257
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:15,360
small bar with colored identification

258
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:17,839
of the paragraph color corresponds

259
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,839
to the

260
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:25,519
small bar as a

261
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:28,959
paragraph and character styles

262
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:31,040
and since color is not the only

263
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:32,000
information or must not be the only

264
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:35,680
information we

265
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:39,040
add numbers to it in the example

266
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:42,959
the tense applied style is

267
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:45,199
you can or cannot read text body

268
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:46,719
it has number 10 and it's green and you

269
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:49,920
can see that

270
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:53,360
the first the third

271
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:56,880
fourth fifth paragraph are

272
00:12:53,360 --> 00:13:00,639
formatted as a text body it's

273
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:00,639
written with ten here and so on

274
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:08,480
now we have the character styles

275
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:12,320
so far it was uh known it's taken from

276
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:15,839
uh an example is word on mac

277
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:18,880
that shows uh the styles like this but

278
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:20,240
it lacks on character styles proposal

279
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:22,720
here is to have a

280
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:26,160
highlighting and a frame around a little

281
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:29,200
bit larger than the actual

282
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:33,600
font is to to visualize

283
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:36,560
that this part of the text

284
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,519
has a certain character style here in

285
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:41,439
this case

286
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:44,880
the 2 in front of it

287
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:48,160
this is a 2 corresponds to

288
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:51,120
this 2 and the color should be also

289
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:52,800
clearly visible to be yellow and the

290
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:56,079
emphasize here

291
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:58,160
is orange

292
00:13:56,079 --> 00:14:00,239
and last but not least we have the

293
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:04,079
direct formatting

294
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:07,040
direct formatting here is done as

295
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:07,920
yellow background with direct formatting

296
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:13,279
so

297
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:16,000
we show um a gray frame around this

298
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:18,560
part of the text to indicate the direct

299
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,560
formatting

300
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:26,800
by the way these lengths

301
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,440
could be also a quite interesting

302
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:30,240
addition

303
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:32,240
if someone is looking for a project

304
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,600
sounds to me not too difficult to

305
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:38,079
implement it

306
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:41,920
and it is very useful to have this

307
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:44,479
such a feature so to summarize

308
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:47,199
google summer of code is coming it is a

309
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:49,839
proposal to add a sidebar

310
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:50,560
a new deck and the sidebar shows the

311
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:52,959
stylus the

312
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:55,119
attributes from styles in the sidebar

313
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:57,839
and

314
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,880
maybe another project to highlight in

315
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:02,000
the document

316
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,000
what is applied

317
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:13,839
that was my talk thank you for listening

318
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:23,439
very interesting uh suggestions

319
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,639
uh thing that come to my mind is to have

320
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:28,320
a big button

321
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:31,519
to see just to click and

322
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:34,880
wipe out all the colors

323
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:35,680
because if a user opens the document all

324
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:41,839
this thing is

325
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:41,839
called user can get lost

326
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:49,680
especially if you are looking at the

327
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:52,480
right bar having

328
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:53,359
some other stuff you may know that you

329
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:56,399
have to code

330
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:59,759
the textiles and then unflank the

331
00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:03,519
you should probably it's a good point

332
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:08,000
okay great idea i love it yeah

333
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:11,680
really really i'm sorry about the lenses

334
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,680
i would just like to say that um

335
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,800
it took me a while to get the idea how

336
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:24,399
to realize it

337
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:27,040
it is a simple it could be a simple svg

338
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:28,160
the the lens itself this magnifying

339
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:31,519
glass

340
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:34,880
and this one here is

341
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:38,000
a circle and i put just some

342
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:41,759
screenshot as a bitmap

343
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:45,360
on top of this shape and

344
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:47,600
it's board everything is there

345
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,959
it you can do it out of the box and it

346
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:52,160
should be possible to

347
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:55,599
to to have this as a function so

348
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:58,639
imagine you create a presentation at

349
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:59,120
a lens from let's say from somewhere at

350
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:02,720
a lens

351
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:05,679
and you can move it around animated

352
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:08,160
it is a killer feature against in

353
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:08,160
powerpoint

354
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:12,079
because i thought you were just

355
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:12,720
mentioning how to zoom the image while

356
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:15,359
you

357
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:17,520
mentioning to include this feature

358
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:19,839
within the document itself

359
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:22,319
so that you can publish documents with

360
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:22,319
the letters

361
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:33,840
it was three steps that i did manually

362
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:33,840
and it could be automated

363
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:46,289
[Music]

364
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:05,120
unused styles um

365
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:07,520
today we have the hierarchy is a

366
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:10,159
different kind of view to

367
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:11,280
use styles if you want to show only the

368
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:14,400
used styles

369
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:16,720
you don't get a hierarchy it's not a

370
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,720
tree

371
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:25,039
so maybe we'll explain right a little

372
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,039
bit later

373
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:31,120
in my case i explore sometimes

374
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:32,399
making quite complex and played with

375
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:35,840
liberalities

376
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:37,679
that is let's say a mess regarding the

377
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:40,240
forms when you set a phone

378
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:42,559
that for example is phone complex or

379
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,559
phone

380
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:57,840
yes that when it's not visible

381
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:57,840
and i end up editing manually

382
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:14,639
that's quite complex to do so just

383
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:15,760
say this because maybe the format is

384
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:19,120
there

385
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:21,840
and it's not quite busy but you know how

386
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:25,280
to enable it you go to tools option

387
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:29,280
language enable the asian

388
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:32,480
and cjk thing and then you get the

389
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:39,840
opportunity to select it

390
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:39,840
in the in the dialogues or am i wrong

391
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:53,840
maybe i got you wrong

392
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,760
for example if one style has this set

393
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:07,840
and the other

394
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:07,840
one has this not set okay

395
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:21,840
or something in hindi

396
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:21,840
it's difficult to know well in japanese

397
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:37,280
okay i don't have an answer

398
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:40,799
um i guess there are

399
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:43,840
many corner cases and uh we cannot solve

400
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:46,960
everything with simple solutions

401
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:50,639
there was one disc point to discuss one

402
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:52,320
it was conditional styles you define

403
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,760
some weird condition and you get a

404
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,840
different appearance

405
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:57,600
depending on the variable that you set

406
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:59,918
then where

407
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,719
hard to imagine that people really use

408
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:03,120
it but

409
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:05,120
there are so many out and it is being

410
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:08,479
used

411
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:11,360
we need some a way to to show the

412
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:12,240
conditional formatting i would do it in

413
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:16,959
a

414
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:19,760
simplest way possible to realize it

415
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:21,200
quicker one option that comes to my mind

416
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:24,559
is to have

417
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:27,600
just a simple an icon this

418
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:31,200
information button next to this to the

419
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:34,399
attributes that has changed by condition

420
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:37,840
also just simple solution

421
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:41,360
or ignore it the majority of users

422
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:41,760
i believe benefit from a good feedback

423
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:46,158
of

424
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:46,158
applied styles better feedback

425
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,480
hopefully

426
00:21:53,280 --> 00:22:11,039
okay no one else so

427
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:11,039
thanks for listening
