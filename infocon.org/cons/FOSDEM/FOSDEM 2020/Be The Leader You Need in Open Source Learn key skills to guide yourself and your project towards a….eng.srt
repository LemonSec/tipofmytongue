and i am so excited to be here today to

9
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,880
talk to you about leadership

10
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:25,359
and as i was preparing this i was

11
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:28,000
wondering have any of you

12
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,480
ever been working in open source and

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,198
just

14
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,399
thought to yourself oh my gosh i wish

15
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:34,480
someone would just

16
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:35,600
lead just point us in the right

17
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,360
direction or

18
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:40,480
just can you get us all working better

19
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:43,040
together does that sound familiar at all

20
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:45,440
yeah i know i have felt that way too and

21
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:47,680
it can be really frustrating

22
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:49,839
but what if you could be the leader you

23
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:51,600
need in open source

24
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,120
well today i'm going to tell you how you

25
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,719
can start doing that

26
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,718
but first i do want to thank you for

27
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:59,840
being here

28
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:00,800
excuse me i think leadership's a really

29
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,399
important topic

30
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,239
and if we can all increase our

31
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:05,360
leadership skills we have the

32
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:08,400
opportunity

33
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:11,439
to make our communities more healthy

34
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:14,320
and our projects much more sustainable

35
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:16,720
so i'm going to use this time to talk

36
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:20,639
about what leadership is

37
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:22,240
and go into a few tips of how to

38
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,920
strengthen your skills

39
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:26,080
and tell you some techniques that you

40
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:29,200
can use starting today

41
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:33,600
and so um does that sound good to you

42
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:36,720
all right oh sure

43
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:41,600
absolutely okay good so then why don't

44
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:44,479
we start with a story

45
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,839
this is a open source leadership story

46
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:47,200
that i ran across

47
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,960
while working with the project that

48
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,640
wanted to improve their contri their

49
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,559
contributor experience

50
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,240
and what we did is we interviewed a lot

51
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,479
of contributors to understand

52
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:59,360
how we could make it better for them and

53
00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:02,000
one story in particular stood out for me

54
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:03,680
and it was a contributor who really

55
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
wanted to make their first

56
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,880
contribution and they looked in the

57
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,479
forums

58
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,519
and they looked in the issues and they

59
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,840
looked around all the different

60
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:14,720
communication channels and they felt

61
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,640
really intimidated and they felt that

62
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:19,440
people were talking in ways that

63
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,640
made it a little scary to step in and

64
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:24,000
ask for help

65
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:25,200
and they waited an entire year before

66
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,640
they finally made their first

67
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,280
contribution

68
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:31,279
and what they ended up doing was

69
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,200
reaching out to a mentor

70
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,400
and asking someone would you please help

71
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,480
me and that person

72
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,760
took the time and walked them through

73
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,119
the steps

74
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,799
so that they could finally make their

75
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,360
first contribution

76
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,040
and fortunately this person had a

77
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,519
learning mindset

78
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,720
and they learned the process and they

79
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:51,760
practiced again

80
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,319
and again and now today this person is

81
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,879
one of the

82
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:56,720
top contributors of their project which

83
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:59,599
is really amazing

84
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:01,040
but it's also really unfortunate it

85
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:02,879
makes me wonder

86
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:05,040
how many contributions did we miss

87
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:06,720
because this person was intimidated

88
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,159
by the way people were interacting in

89
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,280
the communication channels of this

90
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:11,440
project

91
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,440
and the answer is actually about 400

92
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:16,239
commits a year

93
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:17,519
and then i wonder about how many people

94
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:19,200
didn't persevere

95
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,440
like this person did and walked away

96
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:23,920
from the project and never even made a

97
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:25,680
contribution and the answer to that is

98
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:28,079
just too many

99
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,120
now as a pro as a community as an

100
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,280
industry we have gotten

101
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:33,280
so much better and so much more aware of

102
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,840
how we need to communicate with each

103
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,239
other

104
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,200
which is great but we still have work to

105
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,200
do

106
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,720
because what happens in open source is

107
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,119
we all want to help

108
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,760
that's how open source works but when

109
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,400
you step

110
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:48,239
in to help often you are stepping up

111
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,760
into a leadership role and you don't

112
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:51,519
realize it

113
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,879
and let's face it is anyone getting

114
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:55,920
training in open source

115
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:57,760
especially on soft skills no

116
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,280
probably not and so that's one of the

117
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,439
reasons why i like to give this talk

118
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:04,560
just to start raising awareness on the

119
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:04,560
topic of leadership

120
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:11,840
so i think that we have a lot that we

121
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,280
can be doing together

122
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,200
and to learn these leadership skills so

123
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,238
i want to unpack this a little bit for

124
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,159
us

125
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:19,518
so the first question is who were

126
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:23,120
leaders in

127
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:25,759
this story anyone

128
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,560
that's okay i'm going to tell you so the

129
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:28,400
people

130
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,400
in the forums especially people

131
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,919
moderating their leaders

132
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,000
they didn't realize it they're stepping

133
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:35,120
in to help there are people in the

134
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,919
issues that are

135
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,800
reviewing them they are also leaders the

136
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:40,880
mentor

137
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,000
who stepped up and helped this person as

138
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,400
a leader

139
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,400
and actually the individual contributor

140
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,919
is a leader too or at least displaying

141
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,159
leadership traits

142
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:52,400
and i'm going to unpack that a lot more

143
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,400
later on because

144
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,719
we don't normally think of an individual

145
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,080
as a leader but i think we all need to

146
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,759
start seeing ourselves

147
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:03,520
as a leader and understand how we can

148
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:03,520
start having leadership skills

149
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,080
and what is leadership there's actually

150
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,280
no

151
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:12,960
one definition but they're all generally

152
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,919
about the same this happens to be my

153
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,080
favorite

154
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:17,039
from a leadership expert by the name of

155
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,880
kevin cruz

156
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:20,240
and its leadership is a process of

157
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,560
social influence

158
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,639
which maximizes the efforts of others

159
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,240
towards the achievement of a goal

160
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:27,919
and what is so important about this it's

161
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,600
about influence

162
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:31,599
it's about influencing others you can't

163
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,560
make someone do something especially in

164
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,440
open source it is

165
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:37,199
all about influence and it is also about

166
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,000
bringing people together and interacting

167
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:40,960
with them

168
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:44,320
to achieve a common goal and sometimes

169
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:46,719
to understand what something is

170
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,680
it's easy to define what it is not so

171
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:51,199
leadership

172
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:54,400
is not a title or a role right

173
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:57,199
anyone can lead from any position

174
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,239
and it's not a personality type you

175
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:59,840
don't have to be some

176
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,919
extrovert there are lots of great

177
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:04,400
leaders that are introverts too

178
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:06,000
and it is not management it is not about

179
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:10,000
people getting jobs done on

180
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:15,120
time on budget it is also very much

181
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,120
not about power it is about influence

182
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,000
and there are three types of leadership

183
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,799
and the first

184
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,720
one is leading organizations so the most

185
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,520
common one might be the ceo leading a

186
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:29,120
company

187
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:31,520
in open source that might be

188
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:33,280
someone like an executive director who's

189
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:36,080
running a non-profit

190
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:37,758
it could even be the bdfl that's running

191
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:41,120
the entire project and all the comm

192
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:41,600
and the entire community another type is

193
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,520
leading

194
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,520
others so that might be a product

195
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,560
manager in a company that's working with

196
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,479
all kinds of

197
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,599
functions to get a product out the door

198
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:52,000
and promoted

199
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:53,680
in open source that might be that mentor

200
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,440
that's helping people learn how to

201
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,199
contribute

202
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,880
and then the last one is leading

203
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:01,120
yourself

204
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,159
and this is very much what that

205
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,919
contributor was

206
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,680
he was showing a leadership type of

207
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:07,599
leading himself and that means

208
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,720
that you know how to manage your

209
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:10,719
emotions

210
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,479
and be able to control and shift them as

211
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:15,440
needed so that you can have a productive

212
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:18,240
outcome by working with someone else

213
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:19,039
and the reality is is you can't lead

214
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,639
others

215
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:24,560
until you can lead yourself because as

216
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:26,000
you take on more and more responsibility

217
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,880
and more people are looking to you for

218
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,160
direction

219
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:32,159
you have a lot of stress to manage

220
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,199
and you need to be able to control those

221
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,039
emotions

222
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:37,120
so that you can make everyone feel calm

223
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:37,919
and confident so they follow you down

224
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:44,000
the right path

225
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:47,280
to achieve something together

226
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,639
so what do leaders do well research from

227
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:51,758
harvard business review

228
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:53,360
shows that leaders do several things as

229
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:54,720
they're working with groups they shape a

230
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,840
vision

231
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,720
they translate that vision to a clear

232
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:00,239
strategy they bring

233
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,840
teams together and reward them and

234
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:04,400
motivate them

235
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:06,000
and they also focus on measurable

236
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,758
results so there is a clear outcome

237
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,080
they're all working towards

238
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:11,599
they foster innovation in learning and

239
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,039
they are leading themselves while they

240
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:15,039
do all of this

241
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:17,199
and this is exactly what that individual

242
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:18,878
contributor did actually

243
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:20,400
this person had a vision to make a

244
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:22,879
contribution

245
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:24,479
and he had a new strategy instead of

246
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:26,400
just watching and waiting he actually

247
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:28,719
asked for help from a mentor

248
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,919
he recruited that mentor they became a

249
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,840
team and together

250
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:34,000
they wanted to achieve that one goal

251
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:36,640
that one commit

252
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,519
and of course he did foster innovation

253
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,360
and learning

254
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:40,799
got really good at the process really

255
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,880
good at understanding the project

256
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:44,479
that's how he became a top contributor

257
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,760
and the whole time he led himself

258
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,959
through that whole journey

259
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,959
so that he could achieve that

260
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:54,160
so all leaders do what they do what kind

261
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:56,560
of skills do they have to use

262
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:58,640
does anyone know you want to call out a

263
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:01,680
leadership skill

264
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:04,720
communication's a good one any others

265
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:08,479
yup negotiation's a great one too

266
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:10,320
well research shows that there's a lot

267
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:13,040
why are you laughing because there's so

268
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:15,920
many well what's interesting about this

269
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:17,839
is you inspire and motivate others you

270
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:20,000
display integrity and honesty

271
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:22,160
communicate collaborate and when you

272
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,480
look at this what you realize is that

273
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:26,480
whether you are running a company or you

274
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:29,600
are working in open source

275
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:31,279
to lead means you're not really relying

276
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,920
on those technical skills that you have

277
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:34,240
and all those

278
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:36,719
amazing cognitive abilities you're

279
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:39,920
actually relying on soft skills

280
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:42,480
and research shows that

281
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,519
there are all the soft skills research

282
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,839
is showing that

283
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:46,560
two-thirds of leadership is actually

284
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:49,600
reliant

285
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:51,040
on emotional intelligence and that's

286
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,519
something we don't talk about

287
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:55,040
very much in open source actually we

288
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:56,720
don't talk about it much in the world at

289
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,959
all which is a bigger problem

290
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,880
but you know if you think about it we

291
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:02,479
talk a lot more about our cognitive

292
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:04,800
abilities how smart we are

293
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:07,279
and we are really smart we solve

294
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:10,800
incredibly hard problems

295
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:12,959
but we need to start embracing

296
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,240
emotional intelligence in our work

297
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:16,160
because it's clearly

298
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,800
the key to being good leaders in open

299
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:20,880
source so i want to take some time to

300
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:24,240
explore what emotional intelligence

301
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:26,880
is because we should really want this

302
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,000
it makes us better at our work as

303
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,480
contributors

304
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,320
dan goldman who literally wrote the book

305
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,480
on emotional intelligence like it's

306
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:37,200
called emotional intelligence

307
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,399
he said that the difference between good

308
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,200
and great

309
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:43,680
90 percent of good degrade is based on

310
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:47,360
having emotional intelligence skills

311
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:49,120
and what that means is that if these two

312
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:52,160
people in front of me have the same

313
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,880
cognitive abilities but this person on

314
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,279
this side

315
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,160
has more emotional intelligence they're

316
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:59,680
going to be able to

317
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:01,680
be a stronger uh or top performer

318
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:03,439
stronger contributor in the community

319
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,719
and primarily that's because they will

320
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:07,600
have the ability

321
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:09,519
to set a vision with others and

322
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,440
influence others to work towards a goal

323
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:15,839
and you can make a much bigger impact as

324
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,839
a group than you can by yourself

325
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:22,880
so what is emotional intelligence well

326
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:25,120
simply put it's really learning how to

327
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:26,880
manage your own emotions getting really

328
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:29,920
in tune with yourself

329
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:31,519
and also understanding how to attune

330
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,479
with others and influencing their

331
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:34,000
emotions

332
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:37,760
and motivating them so that you will

333
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,760
work together towards that common goal

334
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:43,279
and dan goldman broke it down into five

335
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:44,320
pillars and of course we do not have

336
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:47,600
time to unpack

337
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,760
all of these but you should know that

338
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,519
self-awareness

339
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:52,000
self-regulation and motivation are all

340
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:55,279
about

341
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:58,639
managing your own emotions and

342
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:59,439
empathy and social skills these are

343
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:01,600
about

344
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:06,000
controlling your emotions and then being

345
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:06,000
able to influence the emotions of others

346
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,240
we're just going to focus on

347
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:13,440
self-awareness and self-regulation

348
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:16,639
there are two sides of the same coin

349
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:18,000
and actually when you strengthen these

350
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:19,920
two pillars

351
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,160
you create a strong foundation and

352
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,120
strengthen the other pillars at the same

353
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:26,160
time

354
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:31,120
so let's dive in just a little bit into

355
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:33,519
what this is self-awareness

356
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,959
so self-awareness is just really being

357
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:37,519
in tune with yourself

358
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:38,239
in any given moment knowing how you feel

359
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:41,600
knowing how

360
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:44,560
your emotions can affect others

361
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:46,240
and the other side is self-regulation

362
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,439
that's being able to control those

363
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:50,560
emotions

364
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:52,240
being able to shift them so that you can

365
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,680
have a more productive outcome while

366
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:57,519
working with others

367
00:12:53,680 --> 00:13:00,719
so in the example of the story earlier

368
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:03,360
the contributor was stuck with fear

369
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:05,040
and he knew he was stuck and so he

370
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:08,079
shifted his emotion

371
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:09,920
so that he could be more proactive and

372
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:10,800
then he reached out to someone and

373
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:13,439
shared his

374
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,800
request and his need and his vision and

375
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:17,120
motivated them

376
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,959
to help him and that person donated time

377
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,320
that they didn't have to do

378
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:23,839
so that's self-awareness and

379
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:26,399
self-regulation now let me ask

380
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:27,440
how many of you think you have strong

381
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:30,079
self-awareness

382
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,079
raise your hand

383
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:37,519
yeah all right well you are

384
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,519
right in line with the research

385
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,120
this is a problem it's not an us problem

386
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,440
it's a humanity problem

387
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,959
and research found that 36 percent of

388
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:48,720
people

389
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:51,359
are able to identify their emotions

390
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,160
and well that is just kind of shocking

391
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,800
but

392
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:56,639
it's okay because we can work on this

393
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,319
together

394
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:59,839
and we want you because you know when

395
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,440
you're born with

396
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:03,279
cognitive skills they're only going to

397
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,760
grow so much right

398
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:06,639
and at where we are in like our open

399
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,319
source careers

400
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:09,839
we might be learning more from each

401
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,839
other but it's really going to be

402
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:13,760
diminishing returns at some point

403
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:15,680
and if we really want to go the next

404
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,000
mile we're going to want to lean into

405
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,560
that

406
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,360
emotional intelligence and becoming more

407
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,518
self-aware

408
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,880
be able to self-regulate is the place to

409
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:24,800
start so

410
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:27,279
let's talk a little bit about how we can

411
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,279
do this

412
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:32,160
this is kind of an interesting thing the

413
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:33,040
answer for improving emotional

414
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,600
intelligence

415
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:37,439
is mindfulness and google's done a lot

416
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:39,680
of research in this area

417
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,519
and has started a program called search

418
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:43,120
inside yourself that helps teach

419
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:44,959
leaders how to use mindfulness so they

420
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:47,040
can be better leaders

421
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:48,959
and if you don't know mindfulness it's

422
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,360
really all about being present in the

423
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:52,638
now

424
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:55,920
having a calm nervous system and

425
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:56,399
it really is something that sounds easy

426
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,519
to

427
00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:01,600
attain whether it's meditation or yoga

428
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:02,800
or journaling but i don't know about you

429
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,560
but when someone's like oh you want to

430
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:07,120
be a better leader just meditate

431
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,839
i was like i'm not doing that like it's

432
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,000
just not

433
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:11,519
something that you naturally do it's a

434
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,120
practice you have to build

435
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:14,560
and with any kind of change you have to

436
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:17,839
know why

437
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:19,920
and for me i needed to know why

438
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:21,519
i needed to meditate how it was making

439
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,360
me a better leader how it was

440
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:25,680
changing something in my brain so that i

441
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,720
was doing something that i wasn't doing

442
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:30,638
before

443
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:34,720
and i got my why from dan siegel

444
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:37,440
and he is a interpersonal neurobiologist

445
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,839
a psychiatrist with a specialty and he

446
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,079
has

447
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:42,079
this great way of illustrating how

448
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:44,079
mindfulness helps the brain

449
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:46,479
now if i switch to this mic you can't

450
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:48,638
hear me can you it doesn't work

451
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,920
it does work all right if i put this

452
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:52,399
down it's going to get

453
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:54,399
louder and annoying okay i'm going to

454
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:56,079
try to demonstrate

455
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:57,360
for those like the first three rows i

456
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:58,319
can see i mean the rest of you can look

457
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,920
at the screen

458
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:02,160
and it's not it's a very simple

459
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:06,959
demonstration of how the brain works

460
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:06,959
um but simply put you have

461
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,079
the spinal cord here going up into the

462
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:12,160
brain stem

463
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:13,599
and then you have your downstairs brain

464
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:15,600
as he calls it

465
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:19,120
it's your limbic system it's all of your

466
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:21,920
emotions a fight flight freeze

467
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:23,040
and then you the four fingers are your

468
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:25,279
cortex

469
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:27,599
and your prefrontal cortex that's your

470
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:28,480
upstairs brain this is your logic your

471
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,040
reasoning

472
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:32,560
and what you want is to have an

473
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:34,160
integrated brain where the upstairs

474
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:35,040
brain is working with the downstairs

475
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,519
brain

476
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,639
because all day long you are getting

477
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:40,399
stressors

478
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:41,680
and they are coming up the spinal cord

479
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:44,160
into the brain

480
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,959
and your body's going oh my gosh oh my

481
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:48,000
gosh

482
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:48,800
and then the upstairs brain is saying

483
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,199
it's okay

484
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,839
we've been here before we know what to

485
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:55,120
do

486
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:56,480
we can stay calm and when you have this

487
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,079
integrated brain

488
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:00,880
what you get here in the prefrontal

489
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:03,040
cortex is emotional intelligence

490
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:04,160
this is where you get your awareness

491
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:07,039
this is where you get

492
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:08,959
your self-regulation your empathy

493
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:10,319
everything happens here because of this

494
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:13,280
connection

495
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:15,359
but you're going all day long and you're

496
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:17,119
getting stressors and this connection

497
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:18,479
is not a very strong connection

498
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:20,719
unfortunately and

499
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,000
eventually you get that one email or

500
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:24,240
that pull request

501
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,839
or that tweet and you lose it and you

502
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:28,000
flip your lid

503
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:29,918
and that is how he describes what is

504
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,720
happening to your brain

505
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:33,440
all day long and it can take a good 20

506
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,679
minutes

507
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:37,520
for that to come back down so that you

508
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:39,120
can re-engage and have

509
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:42,080
your the capacity of emotional

510
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,080
intelligence again

511
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:48,240
and so that helped me really understand

512
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:50,000
why mindfulness is important because it

513
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:52,000
starts to really strengthen

514
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,320
the bonds and helps you keep that

515
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,840
upstairs downstairs brain together

516
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,439
while you're dealing with stressful

517
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:59,678
stressful situations

518
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,720
and you especially need that in open

519
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:03,520
source

520
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,400
because the environment in which we work

521
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:07,520
in

522
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:08,559
is more apt to make you flip your lid

523
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:11,120
and that's because we're using

524
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:13,520
asynchronous communications

525
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:14,959
and what social neuroscience has found

526
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:18,320
is that

527
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:20,240
we are wired our brains are wired for

528
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:22,960
face-to-face communication

529
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,679
not asynchronous we are constantly

530
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,160
looking

531
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:27,120
for social cues and body language to

532
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:29,600
help us

533
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:31,360
regulate how we interact with each other

534
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,840
and when we don't have that and we're

535
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,080
working

536
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:36,799
in asynchronous communication like

537
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:39,439
github and slack and twitter

538
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:40,480
we are at a disadvantage and yes we have

539
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,960
emoticons

540
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:44,640
but it doesn't close the gap to what our

541
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,640
brain needs

542
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:48,000
and so research found that there's a

543
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,760
couple things that happen where we're

544
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,080
working in asynchronous communication

545
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:53,600
that you really need just to be aware of

546
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:55,600
and the first one is that when we don't

547
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:58,480
have eye contact

548
00:18:55,600 --> 00:19:00,559
we have less empathy for the person

549
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:03,440
we're working with

550
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:04,000
and also we have this weird thing that

551
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,400
we do

552
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,520
where we project a tone or a voice on

553
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:10,160
someone's

554
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:11,280
tweet or email or whatever the

555
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:13,760
communication channel

556
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,799
is and nine out of ten times it's more

557
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:18,080
negative

558
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:20,160
than what they intended so we are really

559
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:21,760
setting ourselves up to flip our lids

560
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,760
way more than we should

561
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:25,760
and so this is happening all the time

562
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:28,400
and if we could practice on

563
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:29,360
staying calm using mindfulness

564
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,720
techniques

565
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:32,879
to be more present as we're

566
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:34,640
communicating more aware of what we're

567
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,799
dealing with as we're communicating

568
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,760
we will be in a much better situation

569
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:39,918
because when we

570
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,799
don't what happens is we are all just

571
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:43,520
communicating

572
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:44,320
with our pure emotions we have flipped

573
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:46,000
our lids

574
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:48,000
and when it starts to get really bad

575
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,640
like in twitter when we are just

576
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,400
really arguing our point suddenly our

577
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,520
brain just flips a switch and we are

578
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,760
fighting for survival

579
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:57,120
because being right suddenly becomes a

580
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:59,120
form of survival

581
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:01,280
and that's when you see flame wars and

582
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:02,479
we all know those are terrible and we do

583
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,639
not need to go there

584
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:08,320
we just stay a little bit more present

585
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:08,320
with our online communications

586
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:14,320
so mindfulness obviously is something

587
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,280
that can just help set the brain it's a

588
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:18,080
practice

589
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:19,039
that we can use to have more resilience

590
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:21,520
in our brain

591
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:22,480
but it is truly not enough you need

592
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:24,320
strategies

593
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,760
you need strategies that you can use in

594
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:28,720
the moment when

595
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:30,320
you need to reset when you start seeing

596
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,440
things getting a little heated or you

597
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:33,918
start getting that

598
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:35,360
message that really kind of makes you a

599
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:37,360
little unhappy

600
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:38,959
and so some ways that you can reset are

601
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:40,799
some count to ten

602
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:42,000
just count to ten and give yourself some

603
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:44,000
space

604
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,760
you can also take some deep breaths and

605
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,840
there's more science coming out exactly

606
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:49,440
how breathing helps calm the limbic

607
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:51,360
system

608
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:53,039
you can take a walk maybe you need more

609
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,639
than a breath maybe you have to go for a

610
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:55,919
walk around the block before you sit

611
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,799
down and decide how you want to

612
00:20:55,919 --> 00:21:00,240
communicate

613
00:20:56,799 --> 00:21:03,280
and my favorite is sip hot tea

614
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:04,559
there's a great practice of um taking

615
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:07,440
hot tea

616
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:09,120
and and trying not to burn yourself you

617
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,679
suddenly become very present when you

618
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:14,158
don't want to burn yourself

619
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:16,000
it's amazing it's a great little hack so

620
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:17,120
you want to reset yourself but you also

621
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,840
need strategies

622
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:21,120
so that you respond you respond

623
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,799
logically

624
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:24,158
you respond with the intent for

625
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:26,080
productive interaction

626
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:28,480
you don't want to be reacting just from

627
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:30,480
your limbic system purely from emotion

628
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:32,799
and there's a lot of techniques that you

629
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:34,080
can do to improve the way we communicate

630
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:36,559
to each other

631
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:38,559
one that i like is yes and i think you

632
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:40,320
probably have heard this in improv

633
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:41,918
you build off of each other you don't

634
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,960
have to agree someone might give a

635
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:44,960
proposal

636
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,640
and you don't really agree with it you

637
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:49,039
could just say yes

638
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:50,480
and i also think we should consider this

639
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:52,559
right you're not

640
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:54,080
going right at them and you're not

641
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:57,600
starting that whole

642
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:59,039
i need to be right issue the other um

643
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:01,840
approach that i like is a design

644
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:03,919
approach of i like i wish i wonder

645
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:05,600
so if someone has a proposal or someone

646
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:09,120
has submitted

647
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:11,918
something for review you can say i like

648
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:12,719
this but i wish you had also consider

649
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:14,960
that

650
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:17,039
and i wonder if we could explore this as

651
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:20,240
we you know talk about this topic

652
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:23,360
right and it just helps frame it in a

653
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:25,600
more constructive way

654
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:27,439
i also encourage people to explore

655
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:29,199
non-violent communication

656
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:31,039
that's a lot to unpack but there's some

657
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,320
great communication techniques that you

658
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:34,720
can use

659
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:36,399
and i also encourage you to use active

660
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:39,120
listening skills

661
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:40,159
i use this all the time it's a great

662
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:42,719
opportunity to

663
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:44,400
repeat what someone just said so i'll

664
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:47,679
say oh what i hear you saying

665
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:49,840
is and it gives that person a chance

666
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:51,120
to hear what i've understood and correct

667
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:52,158
it so that we can have a shared

668
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:55,600
understanding

669
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:58,159
as we go on and keep discussing

670
00:22:55,600 --> 00:23:00,158
also the last one is when things start

671
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:01,520
getting tough in online communication

672
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:04,240
it's up to you to know

673
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:06,000
when it's just time to go back to that

674
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:08,799
face-to-face communication

675
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,520
it's up to you to call someone go on

676
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:10,879
video

677
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,080
and just pull it out of the online

678
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,360
communication because sometimes our

679
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:16,960
brain just really does

680
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:16,959
need all the social cues

681
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:22,559
so that was a lot that's a lot to learn

682
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:24,480
about a whole new way of of

683
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:26,480
managing yourself and managing others

684
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:30,320
while working in open source

685
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:32,159
so i just want to do a quick recap that

686
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:33,918
leadership you can lead from any

687
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:35,039
position and every time you're trying to

688
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:37,280
help an open source

689
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:39,039
you are stepping into a leadership role

690
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:41,760
just no one's told you that

691
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:43,520
and remember that you can't lead others

692
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:45,760
until you can lead yourself

693
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:47,039
so you really need to work on that

694
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:50,799
self-awareness

695
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:53,919
self-management and also

696
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:55,679
you can strengthen self-awareness

697
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:57,200
regulation all those emotional

698
00:23:55,679 --> 00:24:00,080
intelligence skills

699
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:01,840
by starting a mindfulness practice

700
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:03,600
because it's going to change the way

701
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:05,840
your brain functions and make it much

702
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:08,480
more resilient as we're working online

703
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:09,439
in this asynchronous communication and

704
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,880
again

705
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,880
you want to learn what these strategies

706
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:14,960
are to reset and

707
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,919
to make sure you're responding and not

708
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,960
reacting

709
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:22,720
and i hope you do because we have a huge

710
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:24,480
opportunity remember you have new

711
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:26,000
community members joining you and

712
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:28,400
they're looking to you

713
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,679
they're looking for cues of how safe it

714
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:32,159
is in your community

715
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:33,840
or how they should behave and you have

716
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:35,679
the opportunity to

717
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:37,039
choose how you're going to interact and

718
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:39,760
it might make the difference

719
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:42,400
of scaring them away or inspiring them

720
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:45,600
to be your next top contributor

721
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:46,880
so i hope you choose to lead and be the

722
00:24:45,600 --> 00:25:01,840
leader that we all need

723
00:24:46,880 --> 00:25:01,840
so thank you very much

724
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,039
you
