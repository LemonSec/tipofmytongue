1
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:07,040
so

2
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:08,400
the next presentation will be with

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,080
jordan which will

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:17,920
talk about more than one tool for

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:17,920
collaborating on writing the tiki cms

6
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:25,199
so hello everybody so this is not about

7
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,320
one specific product contrary to the

8
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:29,840
others

9
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:32,480
it's about uh sharing our experience

10
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:35,760
from the tiki the technique cms group

11
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:35,760
where software community

12
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:45,039
about well producing collaborative tools

13
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:47,360
and also collaborating and what we use

14
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:48,320
among ourselves the reason i'm here is

15
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,440
because

16
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,719
well i've been really interested in open

17
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:55,680
source and internet

18
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:57,440
since uh a very long time i discovered

19
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:00,960
tiki and i immediately

20
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:04,959
felt part of the tk community

21
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:08,080
and since uh 2011 i

22
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:12,720
professionally uh work

23
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:14,720
for the tk well as a tiki consultant

24
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,720
so that's not the main topic there's

25
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,679
more here on the link if you're really

26
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:21,439
interested in my

27
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:24,720
in me um so uh what am i

28
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:27,839
uh what does our viewpoint

29
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,640
come from the tiki community i'm talking

30
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,520
about

31
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,720
produces some open source software which

32
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,600
is over one million

33
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:37,439
lines of code we do major releases every

34
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:41,039
eight months

35
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:43,360
every free uh release is a long-term

36
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:46,960
support version which is supported

37
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:50,000
about five years the project started

38
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:53,360
uh nearly 20 years ago by luis

39
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:57,119
algiris and he stayed

40
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:59,439
some years and he left the project

41
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:01,360
afterwards he's not among us anywhere

42
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:05,119
anymore

43
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:08,399
so the so that community it's

44
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:10,000
it's community-managed open development

45
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:14,959
software it is not

46
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:18,640
led by any single company

47
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:21,760
we have a

48
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:26,319
number of us who are consultants

49
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:29,359
manage for hire but we all have our own

50
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:30,399
customers it's not uh there's no central

51
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,280
point

52
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,319
it's not a company which manages

53
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,840
anything

54
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:40,319
so uh there's no single company as i

55
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,519
said there's no benevolent dictator

56
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:45,040
there's not even the

57
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:47,360
initial offer so um

58
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:50,239
communication is the only thing that

59
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:52,640
keeps us together

60
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:55,599
so it's really crucial we without

61
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:59,200
communication there's just no community

62
00:02:55,599 --> 00:03:01,440
and yeah and we're very open

63
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,440
uh the way we work it's we're really

64
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:06,959
open anyone can contribute

65
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:09,200
that's what um version

66
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:11,840
person control systems are for the wiki

67
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:14,000
way of writing software

68
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:16,400
you want to add it if it's really bad

69
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,800
and causes problem it can always be

70
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:22,080
rolled back

71
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:25,360
um so obviously

72
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:28,080
i guess everybody knows the sentence

73
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,840
eat your own dog food which means that

74
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,080
you're never going to convince anyone to

75
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:35,120
use your software if you're not using it

76
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,920
yourself and the second reason why you

77
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,159
have to

78
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,958
use it as much as possible is that yeah

79
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:41,200
how that's

80
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:42,400
that's how you improve it that's how you

81
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:45,599
see what people do

82
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:48,720
with it when you are among those people

83
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:52,079
and then we improve it we add things we

84
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:54,159
fix it that's great um

85
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,360
just about tiki the special thing about

86
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:57,359
tiki it's it's

87
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,439
all inbuilt so at least among the

88
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:02,159
community we never have to

89
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:03,840
argue about which plugin we're going to

90
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:06,159
use there's no

91
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,439
many plugins that all the features are

92
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:09,519
there they're active

93
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:12,480
or they're not active we can use

94
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:12,480
whatever we like

95
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:20,239
so we use the forums as such

96
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:23,759
in order to communicate as well as

97
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:25,359
forums are for we also have wiki pages

98
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:28,479
and documents

99
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:30,639
which means which we use a lot because

100
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:32,000
that's where we have our documentation

101
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:34,400
for users

102
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,960
on one side we have technical

103
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:39,840
documentation on another one

104
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,960
we also have to discuss marketing stuff

105
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:44,560
which

106
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:47,840
we as an open source company are not

107
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:50,479
really great at but we try to um

108
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,960
and we share promotional information you

109
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:54,960
know for

110
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:56,719
for making t-shirts or stuff like that

111
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,320
they're all set and don't know

112
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:02,320
downloadable

113
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:05,599
all those websites have a are federated

114
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:06,479
there's the single login etc it works

115
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:10,000
well

116
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:13,280
people use that um

117
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,680
it's really it's well as usual the

118
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:19,119
documentation for user is a bit

119
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:22,240
late usually but it gets done

120
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:24,240
um we have uh some

121
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,360
what we call a tracker which is really a

122
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,520
database because

123
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,800
it started as a bug tracker and then it

124
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:32,080
expanded

125
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:34,800
uh that's where we share uh

126
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,280
well that's where people report bugs and

127
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,160
also

128
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:40,638
ask for new features that really works

129
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:43,680
fine because

130
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:47,440
we can discuss them we can fix them

131
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:50,880
we know how what remains to be done

132
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:53,199
etc we also have

133
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:55,120
articles feature that's for that's

134
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:56,319
mostly for communication when we have a

135
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,720
new release someone

136
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:59,600
gets an article and we share it on

137
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:03,600
social media

138
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:05,440
and all that um we have a blog feature

139
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:08,720
which is rather underused

140
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:12,240
it's used by the

141
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:15,120
by the assistance administrators team

142
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:17,680
the people who manage our infrastructure

143
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,680
there is a

144
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:22,080
there is some kind of a wiki page

145
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,400
structure

146
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:26,719
and restricted documents and the

147
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,359
restricted blog and the blog is there

148
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,479
because

149
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,680
it's less powerful than articles and all

150
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:35,758
we want about this

151
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:37,840
is to do a operation report

152
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:39,840
so you need a title you need to say when

153
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:41,758
it was done and you need to describe

154
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,119
what was done so that the other

155
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:45,680
assistant means

156
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:47,919
know what has been done and they can

157
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,039
look at how it was done so they can get

158
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:52,240
an inspiration

159
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:54,400
and all that no need for anything

160
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,240
more complicated than that that's why we

161
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:59,440
use the blog for that

162
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:02,800
we have comments comments uh can

163
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:05,360
be linked to any of the above so

164
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,599
you might wonder why we need comments

165
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:09,120
when for example and anyone can edit the

166
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:12,080
wiki pages

167
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,520
by anyone i didn't mention it yeah

168
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,520
anyone can register

169
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:17,120
create an account and you know and

170
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:19,840
contributes there's no

171
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:21,759
real problem uh sometimes we get

172
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,039
spammers this way and we just roll

173
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:26,720
everything back that's

174
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:30,000
it's a wiki um so the comments are

175
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:33,199
for discussing a document well some

176
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,680
stuff like the wishes tracker are

177
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:36,479
commented that's obvious but the wiki

178
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,680
pages is

179
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:41,599
uh the issue you have with wiki pages is

180
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,080
that everybody can contribute on some

181
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:45,039
topic

182
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:47,198
like a technical topic etc but people

183
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:49,199
are polite

184
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,400
so they add their opinion they never

185
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:53,360
remove anything

186
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,960
from anyone else so it's they might

187
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,960
prefer to comment

188
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,080
rather than change the content because

189
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:02,239
they are not so sure

190
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:06,240
etc that's why well both are needed

191
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:09,120
um we also kind of it's kind of a

192
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,560
way of communication yeah we we've used

193
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,599
tiki to

194
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,400
let people provide added information

195
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:16,479
about

196
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:18,638
about themselves or about why they are

197
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:21,120
in the community or

198
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:23,199
or what they look like in a photo when

199
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:26,240
they register

200
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:29,360
and another technical feature which

201
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:31,599
is of course uh really important is that

202
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:33,360
when you have an account you can decide

203
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:36,319
you can set watches on what you're

204
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:38,560
interested in so that you get

205
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:40,479
email when something happens because

206
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:42,799
you're not going back every day on the

207
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,800
site

208
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:50,240
so yeah so that's basically

209
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:51,920
everything tiki provides for us i'm not

210
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,480
saying it's not working

211
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,680
i mean we use it we like it we improve

212
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,959
it

213
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:00,959
uh but there's more uh we also have

214
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:02,800
historic tools

215
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:04,000
we use that because i told you it's

216
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:07,120
nearly 20 years

217
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:10,080
old projects sourcefuls was really

218
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:13,120
fashionable at one time i tell you

219
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:16,560
before they got technical and ethical

220
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:19,440
issues so we still have

221
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:21,359
used that for two things first the

222
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:24,800
subversion rapper which is

223
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:28,240
being migrated to gitlab but it's still

224
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:30,560
going to stay here because we have

225
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,800
those long term support versions which

226
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:36,239
we promise people that

227
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:38,800
they will get upgrades for five years

228
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,399
so it will switch to being read-only but

229
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:44,240
still available so that

230
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:47,519
people can upgrade their website and

231
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:49,279
get the newest security fixes and bug

232
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:52,640
fixes

233
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:54,720
and they provide mailing lists which uh

234
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:56,399
which we use actually so we have a

235
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,640
developers maintenance which

236
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:00,640
is very successful that's basically

237
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:03,040
where we discuss what we want to do

238
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:05,279
etc it's even the one when we say okay

239
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:08,560
we i want to start this

240
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:11,920
and here is the here is the wiki page

241
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:14,319
uh about it but still that's how we get

242
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:17,279
the information

243
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,000
so that works fine so of course there's

244
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:21,439
this issue

245
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,120
that those mailing lists um

246
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,480
people complain that yeah but if you're

247
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,640
not registered

248
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,600
on the maintenance uh you don't get the

249
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,720
information

250
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:32,720
etc but we have that feature that we can

251
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,640
synchronize it with a forum i told you

252
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,320
about the forum one of the forums has

253
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:38,079
the same content you can

254
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:40,560
it shows up in the forum when you're

255
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:42,239
mail and you can answer in the mailing

256
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:44,880
list and we get it in the

257
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,959
uh answer in the forum we're getting a

258
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,680
mailing list we have another one for

259
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:50,880
users

260
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:53,120
uh total failure because

261
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:55,120
uh people will just ask on the

262
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:57,360
developers mailing as they get better

263
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:59,120
answers for more knowledgeable people

264
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,600
and yeah yeah

265
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,240
we have an uh mailing need so it just

266
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,640
gives

267
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,839
all the comments everything that changes

268
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:07,920
in the code and

269
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:09,920
we can review it we have that if that's

270
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,199
where excel people actually use it and

271
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,839
they answer there

272
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,200
in order to comment on discuss uh that

273
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:18,640
shouldn't be this way or

274
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:21,839
yeah that's useful uh

275
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:22,880
historic non-social tools yeah we we are

276
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:26,320
on irc

277
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:26,720
and uh some of us like that it worked

278
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,640
well

279
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:33,200
we have zero maintenance about that uh

280
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:35,920
only issue three years ago i think they

281
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:38,959
had a massive

282
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:39,519
dose yeah they were had trouble so we

283
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:42,640
use it

284
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:43,680
much less it works better again but you

285
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,920
know

286
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,920
and that's how we have frequent debates

287
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:50,640
about why

288
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,640
what's best

289
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:57,040
nothing is best i mean

290
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:58,959
the people who go on the forums are not

291
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,519
the same people who answer questions on

292
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:03,439
irc

293
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:08,480
it's just it just spreads the knowledge

294
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:10,560
yeah so yeah xmpp also is a great

295
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,800
so another thing that's really important

296
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:15,599
is uh the tiki fest

297
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,560
uh tiki fest is when people who don't

298
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,560
usually meet

299
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:20,800
meet like uh you know there's four of

300
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:24,239
them uh some of us are here or

301
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:27,279
some of the us came some days before

302
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:30,079
and we meet it's

303
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:31,760
not a technical issue it's just really

304
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:34,479
important to do that because

305
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,760
once you know the people you can go back

306
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:39,120
to sending them

307
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:41,920
emails and uh

308
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:44,160
it just it's just easier because you

309
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,360
know what the person will understand how

310
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:48,079
you communicate

311
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:49,200
it's just simpler and also you can ask

312
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:52,079
questions like

313
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:53,120
why are they in in the project you know

314
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:55,439
are they really

315
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,480
are they full time are they just curious

316
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:00,000
are they

317
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:03,760
it's yeah another non-technical

318
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
thing to keep in mind uh yeah tiki fests

319
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:07,519
are

320
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,560
kind of expensive so we also do online

321
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:10,800
meetings

322
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,800
and

323
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:15,040
and it's been mentioned one of the great

324
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:18,720
thing about

325
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:20,639
open source software is don't hesitate

326
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,760
to reach to other projects for

327
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:24,560
collaborations

328
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,600
they're open we had a collaboration with

329
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:29,199
big blue button

330
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:31,360
so that got us integration you are

331
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,200
logged in on the tiki site

332
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:35,360
for the meetings and then you click and

333
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:37,120
you get in the big blue button room and

334
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:39,279
you have your own name

335
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,320
and if you didn't register it shows

336
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:43,600
guest

337
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:45,040
we get our um we do that for monthly

338
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:47,279
roundtable meetings

339
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:50,160
which started as webinars but it's not

340
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:53,360
really presentations it

341
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:56,399
one hour uh very short topics

342
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:59,440
you know like hey next month

343
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:00,160
there's them who's coming and one hour

344
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,480
of

345
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:03,680
presentations anyone has some new things

346
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:06,160
to present to

347
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:07,120
how it's done and new features are

348
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:11,360
usually

349
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:14,240
easier to present on the on a way on a

350
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:15,920
webinar because then it's usually

351
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,920
someone else who will have to write the

352
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:20,560
user documentation we are mostly

353
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:22,959
volunteers on that you know

354
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:24,079
tiki admin group meetings oh i didn't

355
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:27,680
mention that

356
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:31,199
we have um we have an association which

357
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:33,439
as i said as you may have figured out

358
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:34,800
the community created the association

359
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,560
the association did not

360
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:39,199
create the community it's for holding

361
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:42,399
the copyright

362
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:45,279
to the name and dealing with server

363
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:46,720
and stuff so they meet every three

364
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:50,639
months

365
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:51,120
um we've also we really like jitsumit

366
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:53,360
also

367
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,880
we've been in contact with them but

368
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:58,000
there was no real reason

369
00:14:54,880 --> 00:15:01,199
for doing any collaboration because it

370
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:05,920
just works and for our time

371
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:05,920
big blue button had took a long time

372
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:11,199
before they switched from flash to html5

373
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,839
so

374
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:15,680
now we and we were not really happy and

375
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:19,040
we were really happy to have an

376
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:20,479
uh an alternative so yeah no big blue

377
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:23,839
button runs fine and

378
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:26,320
yeah and it still is recorded on our

379
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:28,079
servers which is cool because jitsimi

380
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:30,399
doesn't have that you we could record

381
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:34,638
that but i think it goes to google we

382
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:36,399
obviously don't like that we i mean

383
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:38,399
i'm happy for them that they have that

384
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:41,279
option is clearly the thing to do but we

385
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:43,839
don't want to use it

386
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:45,279
other ways of collaborating is that tiki

387
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:50,880
is part of wiki switch

388
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:54,800
which is a project about providing

389
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:58,320
all the needs of a small company

390
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:59,599
only with open source staff so we get in

391
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:03,360
touch with

392
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:05,600
people or other products and we get

393
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:07,600
contacts with some of those other

394
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:10,480
projects that's how we have that

395
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,360
xmpp thing which competes with irc

396
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,800
because it's

397
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:18,560
it is more modern you know and um

398
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:21,680
we have people we getting in touch with

399
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:24,479
goose especially about having that

400
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:25,439
opened fire server converse gs which

401
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:28,800
gives you

402
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:32,720
gives us a web mail a web-based

403
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:36,240
interface to the xmpp which you can

404
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:40,240
get on wiki suite.chats

405
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:42,880
and the pade is an app which is also

406
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,560
a browser-based but it has its own

407
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:48,959
window

408
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:52,239
um that's that gets us because i think

409
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:54,079
xmpp as a protocol has a lot of things

410
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:57,680
for its federated it has

411
00:16:54,079 --> 00:17:00,800
everything uh but the focus i

412
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:04,959
think personally is the clients

413
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:09,198
right now for for more

414
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:09,679
use of it um think thing is also part of

415
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:14,720
it so

416
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:18,079
we use it to spread backups and all that

417
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:20,799
and yes so the message again

418
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:21,678
is yes uh we discovered that even though

419
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:25,918
we provide

420
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:25,919
collaboration tools uh

421
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,280
a good thing is to have a lot of them

422
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,280
and also

423
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:33,678
some we have for historical reason and

424
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:34,240
we want to change etc it's not the same

425
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:37,440
ones

426
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:39,520
as 10 years ago it changes so we want to

427
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:41,440
change also we also have plans

428
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,960
i told you we are not going to stay on

429
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:46,559
subversion

430
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:47,520
not even on salesforce but that takes

431
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:50,720
time

432
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:52,160
for change management's reasons we want

433
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:55,679
to really improve

434
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:57,200
our email the mail integration

435
00:17:55,679 --> 00:18:00,400
capability we have

436
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:03,760
shift integration gmap in

437
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:04,160
in tiki and in tk21 which is the one we

438
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:07,840
just

439
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:10,880
branched yesterday uh

440
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:14,159
we have caldaven dev

441
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:17,039
and as usual now that we have them

442
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:18,320
they we will improve our way of using

443
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:23,360
them

444
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:25,918
as a summary um how does it work

445
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:26,559
generally speaking for us when we want

446
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:29,120
to know

447
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:30,000
where we want to go and make plans the

448
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,320
things that work

449
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,000
great because at some point you have to

450
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:37,280
make a decision

451
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:39,760
uh the tiki fest when does enough of us

452
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:40,720
and the other others on online at the

453
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:43,520
end of this

454
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:44,480
decision just and say okay we all kind

455
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,639
of agree that

456
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,520
that's what we do we have the

457
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:50,480
development

458
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:52,720
meaning is because everybody's on it

459
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:54,400
basically so

460
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:57,039
you know what's going on it's a nice

461
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,840
place for and it's and it is recorded we

462
00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:01,760
have

463
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:02,240
we have all of that um wiki pages are

464
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:04,879
also

465
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:07,360
great when we don't want when we don't

466
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:09,919
know what where we want to go and we

467
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:11,039
want more feedback the wish tracker is

468
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:13,520
also one of those ways

469
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:14,080
that new stuff pop up because people ask

470
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:17,360
for them

471
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:20,080
and we do them or not um

472
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:22,320
and there are those monthly roundtable

473
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:25,600
meetings

474
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:28,879
the tag is a tiki admin group which

475
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:30,799
also gets things for plans and when we

476
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:33,360
want to discuss how we do things

477
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:33,840
uh well there's a lot of discussion

478
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,959
about

479
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:40,399
comments which were done and people just

480
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:41,600
start a thread about that or again the

481
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:46,240
dev tiki or

482
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:53,840
wiki pages just okay how do we do that

483
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:53,840
which is basically so

484
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:57,760
did i leave time for questions so

485
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:08,960
then any questions about or unclear so

486
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,559
uh if i understand correctly so in the

487
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,240
tiki community you have kind of a

488
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:14,320
limited amount of developers of

489
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:16,640
development workforce so how do you

490
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:18,000
manage to basically provide new features

491
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,600
to the project

492
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,720
while still supporting some of the

493
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:26,080
features that you support as part of the

494
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:28,960
kind of backup compatibility strategy or

495
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:30,480
long-term support strategy so one of the

496
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,640
reasons

497
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,000
we are really happy with the way a tiki

498
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:37,120
community works is that

499
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:40,159
a lot of us do that as paid

500
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:44,000
consultants and that means we have our

501
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:47,280
customers oh the question was

502
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,679
we have limited development force how do

503
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,399
we

504
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:51,200
spread the word the the work and decide

505
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,320
on

506
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:58,240
support old stuff and add new stuff

507
00:20:54,320 --> 00:21:01,360
um part of

508
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:04,320
our job is it's

509
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:05,199
very powerful software it gets really

510
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,918
complicated

511
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:09,840
people like to have a consultant do it

512
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:10,640
for them because they have another work

513
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:14,399
they're good at

514
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:17,760
which they want to focus on and um

515
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:20,559
so but they have complex needs

516
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:21,280
so basically it's you it's often if that

517
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:24,158
ticket has

518
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,559
90 percent of what they want and one of

519
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:26,480
us

520
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:27,760
they they pay one of us to add the 10

521
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:30,000
percent and we

522
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:31,120
recontribute that 10 percent to the

523
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,840
community

524
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:34,158
so that's how we get the new things as

525
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,639
for

526
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:38,880
maintaining maintaining the old things

527
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:42,320
well whoever uses the

528
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:45,360
old things will complain that

529
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:45,918
broken on upgrade they also uh yeah they

530
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:48,879
also

531
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:50,960
want upgrades because okay we we stay

532
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:52,880
five years is not that long

533
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:54,720
they come back they won the new version

534
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:56,640
they said i don't

535
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:58,320
thanks for the new stuff but i like the

536
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:00,720
old one and

537
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:02,639
you just broke it it seems or it could

538
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:05,840
be better

539
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:07,840
and so there's no yeah central point

540
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:10,879
where people decide you will do this

541
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:12,080
you will do this it's if nobody uses

542
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:15,360
something

543
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:16,399
then nobody will touch it it's and after

544
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:20,639
a while we say

545
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:20,640
okay this is deprecated

546
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:27,840
any other question

547
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:32,639
you
