1
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,559
okay my name is

2
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:10,320
lionel brush i work in mri so i'm not a

3
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:11,120
designer i'm not a programmer i'm

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,280
actually a

5
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:15,120
guy who designs a device and make it

6
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:17,520
work and tries to actually get

7
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,198
the whole things together um i'm working

8
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,520
on a new type of mri device

9
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,640
something that sees new kind of contrast

10
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:24,960
and can be explored

11
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,640
for for medical applications and i want

12
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,640
to make it open sourced

13
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,160
now mri is not something you can build

14
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,920
in your garage it's some

15
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,840
complex kind of equipment as you can

16
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,160
guess it requires a lot of skills and so

17
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,480
on

18
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,839
so making things like this open source

19
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,839
is quite a challenge

20
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,920
and what i want to try and make is

21
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,040
something like an open source hardware

22
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,160
repository

23
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,000
something you could install on your

24
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,519
computer you would actually be able to

25
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,640
browse project online

26
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,920
if you find something that is

27
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,600
interesting for you you download the

28
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,840
file you have all the blueprints all the

29
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,039
steps needed to actually mark the device

30
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,800
all the skills needed all the

31
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:58,640
documentation and so on and then you

32
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,800
just follow step by step so basically

33
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,000
the code is the blueprint and the

34
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,440
compiler is yourself

35
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,360
or whatever tools you use to actually

36
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:07,200
make the device and when the device is

37
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,000
built you have a virtual environment on

38
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,520
your computer that

39
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,439
actually can track what the device does

40
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,640
and so on so that would actually be

41
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:13,439
quite nice to develop these kind of

42
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,240
ideas but

43
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:17,919
i'm not a designer i'm not a programmer

44
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,679
so what i would like to have is some

45
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,320
help from a designer or programmer to

46
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,240
give some

47
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,839
inputs about how this could actually

48
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:26,080
look like not make it

49
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,840
at this stage but to have some realistic

50
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,520
view of how this could look like

51
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,000
technically so that i can apply for

52
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,798
grants and get actually someone hired to

53
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,799
do the job

54
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,159
so if anyone here would be happy to have

55
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,920
a discussion or a chat

56
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:39,280
tonight or on the beer or whatever i'm

57
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,360
happy to to talk

58
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,799
i leave my email address on the board so

59
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,900
you can contact me

60
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:49,280
thank you

61
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:55,840
[Applause]

62
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:55,840
so you're i'm still

63
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,920
yeah that's my left whole body we have

64
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,080
patients coming there and so on

65
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:13,440
we have a few prototypes already done

66
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,120
it's working great we have clinical

67
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,319
studies going on and now i want to open

68
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,000
sources

69
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:19,519
which would be great and i'm not the

70
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,120
only one to do that because there's a

71
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,040
whole community doing this called

72
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,720
open source imaging initiative they are

73
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,760
working on open source mri and

74
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,920
ultrasounds

75
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,120
and also devices they are part of this

76
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:32,160
but

77
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:36,160
again we are hardware guys and

78
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,160
any help home design and

79
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,359
or the interface that the mri technician

80
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:53,920
would be using

81
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,519
the entire thing so basically what we've

82
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,079
done in aberdeen so far has been to

83
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:58,000
assemble

84
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,599
pcs that were built by suppliers because

85
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,920
it's so difficult to get you know

86
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:03,599
proper gradients and magnets and so on

87
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,079
these guys in open source initiative are

88
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:05,840
actually

89
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,360
uh trying to regroup all their

90
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,720
initiatives around open source hardware

91
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,159
that are relevant to mri

92
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,760
they manage to get the whole system

93
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:13,679
actually from the magnet to the

94
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,760
gradients to the chords to whatever

95
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,040
so lots of pieces are there for a bare

96
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:20,159
bone scanner at least

97
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:21,440
so we need a bit more but um and what

98
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:23,440
we've done in aberdeen is

99
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:25,680
well integrating all that getting the

100
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:28,480
software to work getting the images

101
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,599
making the patient studies validating

102
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,280
doing the research on

103
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:32,798
how we can actually use it what

104
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,879
information it gives that could be

105
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:36,560
useful for clinicians relating with

106
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:38,159
the hospital over there that's what

107
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:47,519
we've done over there yes

108
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:50,879
so a bit of well yeah go to bed

109
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:52,480
thank you very much but yeah so again

110
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:54,000
having someone to help with uh

111
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,599
those apart so all the the technical

112
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,319
thing would be great so yeah

113
00:03:55,599 --> 00:04:01,839
if you want to help or to be part that

114
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:01,839
would be great

115
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:11,309
thank you maybe maybe time for someone

116
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:11,310
[Applause]

117
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:29,840
else

118
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:29,840
okay uh who would like to go next

119
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:43,840
you have some slimes yes i have them

120
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,840
okay

121
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,840
um

122
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:29,829
[Music]

123
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:42,639
um should i put this so

124
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:46,080
okay okay

125
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:48,160
so hi i'm i'm sophia i'm from the

126
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,099
uva team and the rest of the team is

127
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,600
there

128
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:53,440
[Laughter]

129
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,600
i want to explain a little bit the

130
00:05:53,440 --> 00:06:00,880
problem we are facing in order

131
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:04,080
to understand the project so um

132
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:06,000
we are facing what we all are facing

133
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:09,039
like mankind is facing these two

134
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:13,199
problems no surveillance capitalism and

135
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:16,400
the loss of control of our data so

136
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:19,440
we wanted to regain this data

137
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:22,719
and this owner data ownership and

138
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:25,280
we decided to build a platform to escape

139
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:28,800
from the corporate consumer cloud

140
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:31,520
so to do so what is juvia no the the

141
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,880
our project uv is a physical device that

142
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,039
everyone will have

143
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,240
the the everyone that they want we have

144
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:39,440
in their house

145
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:42,400
and you can have their

146
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,199
storage email contacts calendar or any

147
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,039
kind of

148
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:47,199
app that you can download from a

149
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:50,400
decentralized marketplace

150
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:50,400
so we wanted

151
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:56,400
uh as you can access to the device

152
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,360
from anywhere through a secure

153
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:01,039
connection

154
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:03,520
a via tour and the intention is

155
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:04,880
that everything is open transparent

156
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,919
auditable

157
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:10,719
and easy to use

158
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:13,919
so this is the tricky part the that

159
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,919
connects with the design

160
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,919
in order to have some something that is

161
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:21,120
very

162
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:24,400
easy to use by anyone like our

163
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:27,919
parents or grandparents uh

164
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:31,919
we need to make a big effort in design

165
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:35,039
so we have to develop a design system

166
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:38,639
we have also to develop the

167
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:41,039
user interface and the user experience

168
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:42,319
these are part of the work that we are

169
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:45,360
now doing

170
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:45,919
and we also have to develop the hardware

171
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,039
case

172
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:50,479
appearance so that that are the three

173
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:53,680
fields in design that

174
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:55,919
we are working on and that we need help

175
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:59,440

177
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:03,759
next generation internet initiative

178
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:05,440

200
00:10:14,839 --> 00:10:19,200

the post on the website

227
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:40,800
as well just a sort of concise

228
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:42,079
what it does what you're looking for and

229
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,279
then contacting each other we might have

230
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:48,800
some

231
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:48,800
questions over back with you but that's

232
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:57,360
so my name is philip durbin i come from

233
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,800
harvard university and i just gave a

234
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,000
lightning talk about our project at two

235
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,359
o'clock so you should be able to find

236
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,880
the recording there

237
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:05,279
um but i thought i'd at least mention

238
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:07,920
here uh tell a quick story about

239
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:08,560
dataverse that i told at the open source

240
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,319
design

241
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:12,479
table which is that we did a big rewrite

242
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:15,200
of our software about

243
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,000
five years ago or so and it came about

244
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,480
because we

245
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,480
had a usability study done on the

246
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:23,680
previous generation the first software

247
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:25,519
so it was called ddn3 we basically

248
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:27,279
had some students from simmons college

249
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:29,120
in boston common like look at the

250
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:31,839
software and gave us a report

251
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:34,079
and it came back negative like your

252
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:35,040
software is unusable unfortunately which

253
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:37,040
led directly to

254
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:39,040
us saying okay well we need to like it

255
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:40,959
was like a come to jesus moment

256
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,319
like we need to really decide what are

257
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:44,560
we going to do and so we did a big

258
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,600
rewrite with a folk we hired a usability

259
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:48,479
person

260
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:50,399
and really focused on usability for the

261
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,959
the current generation of the software

262
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:55,199
and now what we're seeing is i mean this

263
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:59,518
is not a direct line right but

264
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:59,519
um if we look at our installations

265
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,120
uh we now have 52 installations around

266
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,439
the world

267
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:07,279
six continents and i'm not trying to say

268
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,839
it's because exactly of the usability

269
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,920
study

270
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:12,560
but i really think that the emphasis on

271
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:14,639
usability has helped a ton

272
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:16,000
so uh i guess i'm just trying to spread

273
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:18,000
the word that like tell encourage

274
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,760
projects to like bring in usability

275
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,519
people to study the current state of

276
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:25,120
affairs and like see if you can

277
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:28,839
get some traction that way um

278
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:31,839
i how much time do i have should i wrap

279
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:31,839
up

280
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:37,599
i have a totally unrelated project i'm a

281
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,880
dad i have a 13 year old daughter and a

282
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:42,240
10 year old daughter

283
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:44,240
and i thought i'd show one other quick

284
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:47,120
open source project that another dad and

285
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:47,120
i have been hacking on

286
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,720
are you looking for input in some way

287
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,320
well i don't know we could use a logo

288
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,440
right right now the 10 year old is doing

289
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,199
the the artwork

290
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:59,600
using that open source tool called

291
00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:01,760
piscol so she made this little bee

292
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,199
and she's doing other stuff but i just

293
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,560
thought i'd just sort of spread like the

294
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:07,839
word about this idea

295
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:09,760
anyway um and the idea is that

296
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:11,199
if you have a 13 year old like me like

297
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,800
these kids are all on their phones you

298
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:15,120
know they're not you know

299
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:16,800
they um we would like to get them more

300
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,560
engaged in the community

301
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:20,639
and and they're trying to raise money

302
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:23,040
for their class trip and to go see

303
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:24,000
the boston red sox baseball team go go

304
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,839
play baseball

305
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,680
and they want to go on a cruise in the

306
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:29,440
harbor as part of the school

307
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,800
uh fundraising effort and so we thought

308
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,320
well what if we put these kids at work

309
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,680
what if they put down the phone

310
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:35,680
and they could shovel snow they'd get a

311
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,479
lot of snow in boston or or they could

312
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:39,199
walk dogs

313
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,519
or uh do cat city and that kind of thing

314
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:41,120
so

315
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,560
my friend of mine and i built this thing

316
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:45,120
mostly him uh

317
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:46,880
called helper bees and the idea is that

318
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,399
if you're a member of our community it's

319
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:50,000
kind of a hyper local thing and you're

320
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:52,880
like oh i need a dog walker

321
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,240
you you click on dog walking and then

322
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:56,800
the idea is that

323
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,839
the parent or the neighbor is donating

324
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:00,560
10 bucks

325
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:01,279
and getting two dog walks from these 13

326
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,119
year olds

327
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:04,480
so it's just a way to like give the kids

328
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,720
opportunities like do

329
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,160
a little something and then connect

330
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,320
people so

331
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,759
it's worked out pretty well for for my

332
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:13,279
daughter where you know it's sort of

333
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:15,199
introducing her to the world of work a

334
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:16,880
little bit where she was hired to be a

335
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:17,519
party helper and she was like oh what do

336
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,800
i wear

337
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:20,720
you know so it's kind of just get her

338
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:23,040
thinking about those things this is all

339
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,480
on github also this uh health abuse

340
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:37,839
thing i just thought i'd

341
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:37,839
spread the word thank you okay

342
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:47,920
do you have a presentation no why

343
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:53,680
or anything okay so i

344
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:56,079
haven't come prepared him here to

345
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:59,359
present the project and idea but

346
00:16:56,079 --> 00:17:02,479
hearing about this speech complete

347
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:04,720
say let's give it a try okay so what do

348
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,919
i have in mind is a bit more challenging

349
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,079
to the system

350
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:11,600
i don't know if you can you raise a hand

351
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:14,720
if you're familiar with cryptocurrencies

352
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:16,719
okay this is a good crowd okay now the

353
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,439
problem in cryptocurrency is mostly the

354
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,079
entry and

355
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:20,959
exit from fiat to cryptocurrencies and

356
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:24,159
usually this

357
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:26,720
is solved for now by exchanges by third

358
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:29,280
party exchanges which

359
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:30,960
operate and facilitate you in your

360
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:33,280
interaction and your

361
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,480
bid execution on their platform the

362
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:37,600
problem is that

363
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:38,000
those third party are allowed to censor

364
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,240
you

365
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,120
they reserve the right to disallow you

366
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,679
to

367
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:45,039
execute transaction and even seize funds

368
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:48,320
now my solution to this

369
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:51,039
is to design and conceive unbanked

370
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:52,240
cryptocurrency atm this is a bit

371
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:56,400
challenging because

372
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:58,559
the current existing atms you have the

373
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,400
atm which is calling an api to an

374
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:01,678
exchange executing the trade according

375
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:04,720
to what was custom

376
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:05,520
the customer doing but here you have the

377
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,600
risk that

378
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:09,200
you as an operator you have to take the

379
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:11,600
cash from the machine

380
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:14,320
go to the bank deposit the cash then

381
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:15,840
wire the money to exchange uh here there

382
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:18,799
are two third parties which

383
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:20,080
uh could seize your money first is the

384
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:21,918
bank who can

385
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:23,520
simply close your account and say we

386
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:25,840
don't accept your funds

387
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:27,679
secondly there's the exchange which

388
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,080
could ask okay how did you get the funds

389
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:31,440
and

390
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:34,720
all the aml and kic procedures which is

391
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:38,080
inconvenient for people who want just

392
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:38,880
to use the technology so there's like a

393
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:42,639
bottleneck

394
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:44,240
through to access this technology due to

395
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:46,160
relying still relying on the third

396
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,960
parties so my idea is to build the

397
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,880
descent

398
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,240
not decentralized that's i think

399
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:53,679
misusing the word

400
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:56,000
uh unbanked uh cryptocurrency atm where

401
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:57,039
the price would be determined locally by

402
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,559
a local

403
00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:04,160
offer and demand and

404
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:07,520
people would speculate on the local

405
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:09,760
transaction on the local demand so the

406
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:11,200
feeling and the emptying of the atm

407
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:14,080
wouldn't be

408
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:15,919
the responsibility of the operator the

409
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:17,039
operator would have to maintain only

410
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:20,080
technically like

411
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:22,799
repair parts replace touchscreen or

412
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,799
something like that

413
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:27,360
now this is a very old broad overview of

414
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:29,280
the idea now

415
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,559
in order to launch such a project i

416
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,399
still have a lot of

417
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:33,600
questions which i don't have to ask this

418
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:37,280
is a for-profit

419
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:38,080
oriented project so uh i'm not willing

420
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:42,000
to invest

421
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:45,439
funds to pay people to come to work

422
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:47,280
to employ people but i'm more willing to

423
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:49,360
find a model to reward dirty

424
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,399
contributors and early participants in

425
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:52,959
the project

426
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:55,679
and there are a lot of things to settle

427
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:57,840
a lot of areas of expertise are

428
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:59,200
intersected in this project for example

429
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:01,678
i would mean

430
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:03,840
first the government structures like uh

431
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:06,640
the reward the contribution and

432
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:08,480
the whole model of the project then

433
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:11,440
there is building the entire project

434
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:12,320
which is what computer what operating

435
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:15,280
system

436
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:16,000
designing the case designing the user

437
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:19,039
interface

438
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:21,520
there's a big load of work

439
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:22,720
i have already some people involved from

440
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:25,360
the community

441
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,320
which more particularly the more narrow

442
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:29,280
one

443
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:31,520
who are interested and contribute with

444
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:34,799
ideas to this project but due to

445
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:36,799
personal situation i'm kind of stuck so

446
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:37,840
if you're interested maybe to

447
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:40,960
participate in

448
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:43,360
something like this well i'll drop my

449
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:45,679
contact details here any questions

450
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,678
thoughts

451
00:20:55,200 --> 00:21:01,039
well usually the more if cost effective

452
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:03,440
would be to use a bank an exchange

453
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:04,240
but when you're censored by those those

454
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:07,200
institutions

455
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:08,960
cause is not really a reason besides

456
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,400
this you as an operator you have

457
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,400
multiple

458
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,679
the way i view the terminal would be

459
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:17,039
able to have

460
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:19,840
three sources of monetization first

461
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:20,720
maybe internet access people this can be

462
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,799
promoted as

463
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:24,480
an internet terminal people just browse

464
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:26,000
the internet and pay either with crypto

465
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:28,480
either with fiat

466
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,280
it can be used as a net platform like

467
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,600
companies

468
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:32,399
present ads on the terminal so people

469
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,719
who are

470
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,520
visiting passing by or they give back

471
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,200
they pay for

472
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:38,559
free access to their website of the

473
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:41,280
terminal and

474
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:43,120
the third is practically the

475
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:45,360
cryptocurrency exchange where the

476
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:48,879
operator would get a fee from each

477
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:48,879
transaction from each exchange

478
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:54,559
and yes now it's supposed to i suppose

479
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:58,799
to

480
00:21:54,559 --> 00:22:01,280
conceive a model to split the revenue

481
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:02,400
between developers and contributors and

482
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:06,320
people who are working

483
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:06,320
to the project and operators

484
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:14,320
which country do you wish

485
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:17,280
it's an open source project which the

486
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:19,520
idea is anyone can buy build a computer

487
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:21,200
uh star screen and the bill etc and they

488
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:23,120
build their own machine

489
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:27,840
that's that's my idea so i don't want to

490
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:27,840
target the particular account

491
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:34,960
is this illegal you're starting on the

492
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:37,840
premises that something must

493
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:38,840
be specifically legal in order to do it

494
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:43,520
so where's

495
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:46,639
the why

496
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:47,918
okay so i'm going to uh if you want to

497
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,520
continue

498
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:55,840
very interesting discussion which i

499
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:55,840
don't know

500
00:22:56,810 --> 00:23:00,050
[Music]

501
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:05,030
[Applause]

502
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:12,720
next uh okay project just because we're

503
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:13,678
running out of time no you're running

504
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:16,000
out of the

505
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:17,520
of the camera camera's recording there

506
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,799
and houston yes

507
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:25,600
gentlemen prefer to stand off the camera

508
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:29,440
that's totally fine uh microphone

509
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:29,439
up here okay

510
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:37,840
so where's the barriers okay

511
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:40,399
stick it in your pocket excellent this

512
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:40,399
one is a bit

513
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:47,279
cool okay hey hello so i'm tom i work on

514
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:49,200
ettasync

515
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:51,200
it's essentially end-to-end encrypt and

516
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,880
sync your contacts calendars and tasks

517
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:55,840
i know it's a mouthful think something

518
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:57,919
like icloud or next cloud or

519
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:59,439
gmail account or google account sorry

520
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:01,520
but encrypted in a way that the service

521
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:02,720
provider for example apple cannot access

522
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:04,400
your data

523
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:05,760
and so for example whatsapp has

524
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,120
end-to-end encryption so it encrypts

525
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:09,120
your data in that way

526
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:10,559
if they're not clear and so how does it

527
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,520
work at the moment so it's been around

528
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:14,720
for three years now

529
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:16,240
it's an old project or ish young-ish and

530
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,039
you just on android for example you just

531
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,640
install the app

532
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:19,919
and then you just start using it as if

533
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,799
it's a normal google account so you

534
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:22,880
continue using

535
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:24,320
the calendar app that you love and the

536
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:26,000
contacts app that you love and all of

537
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:27,439
that just remains the same

538
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,120
so that sounds as if there's not a lot

539
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:32,080
of ui and you'd be right

540
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:32,559
that in on android there isn't a lot but

541
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,799
the

542
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:36,720
ux and ui issue here is the onboarding

543
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:39,039
because i had to explain it to you

544
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,840
in 20 seconds or however long and i

545
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:41,919
think

546
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:43,840
a lot of users bounce at that stage and

547
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:46,400
i know from feedback that a lot of users

548
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:47,678
install it star use like open the app

549
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,200
and they're like wait i can't add

550
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:51,200
calendars yeah you can't yeah okay

551
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,799
sorry calendar events and the reason is

552
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,360
of course because you should use your

553
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:55,279
normal

554
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:57,039
calendaring app but i think the

555
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:58,640
onboarding i'm missing something

556
00:24:57,039 --> 00:25:00,879
in the way of nudging so i thought for

557
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:01,440
example about adding a button that lets

558
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,120
you add

559
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,400
an event but then when you click it it

560
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:06,000
actually says no you should use your

561
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,440
normal app that would be a solution

562
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,600
but i think the problem is that all of

563
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:11,039
the onboarding flow is not really

564
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,879
i don't know pushing people the right

565
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:15,120
way at least on android either

566
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:16,240
we have a web client where we actually

567
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:18,239
control the

568
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,679
the ui and it's really ugly but that's i

569
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,039
think that's less of a concern

570
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:22,880
i mean i want to fix that but it's less

571
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:24,240
of a concern as much as the onboarding

572
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:26,240
which is really poor across

573
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:28,320
all platforms so this is something i

574
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:30,400
would love to get help yeah

575
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:32,080
and also we're funded by um i mean

576
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,840
supported not really funded by

577
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:35,439
ngi zero internet i don't know if you're

578
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:37,120
familiar with them and they just

579
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:39,440
had a meet up so we partially supported

580
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:43,520
by them yeah so

581
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:46,960
cool so it's uh it's a transport

582
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:49,279
for end-to-end encrypted contacts

583
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:50,400
you have a contact or a calendar event

584
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:52,799
on your phone

585
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:54,080
it goes to wherever it's going to go to

586
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:56,639
but it's encrypted there

587
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:57,439
so yeah yes but in in addition to that

588
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:59,279
it's not just a

589
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:01,039
transport it also just stores it so

590
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:02,640
think exactly like icloud

591
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:04,080
so if you lose your phone you can just

592
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,200
install it again and everything

593
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,639
you can download back as long as you

594
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,200
have the encryption password that's by

595
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,880
the way

596
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,320
another thing if you lose your

597
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:12,080
encryption password you cannot access

598
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:13,279
your data and that's another thing when

599
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,639
we kind of like need

600
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:16,320
part of the onboarding or maybe a bit

601
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:18,720
later i don't know like five days

602
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:20,480
in to kind of have a way to make sure

603
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,360
that they know it and they have a backup

604
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,799
of something

605
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:25,360
i don't know it's a lot of challenges

606
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:28,799
essentially of bringing encryption to

607
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:29,600
like wide adoption um yeah i have some

608
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:31,520
idea

609
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:34,639
i see that happening also with that with

610
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:36,840
all the bitcoins and all these things

611
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:40,240
with apps on your phone that that

612
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:42,559
initially requires you to re-enter

613
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:44,240
these private keys on numbers so maybe

614
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:45,520
only the phrase of that or the start of

615
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:47,200
the finish

616
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:50,320
so they force you to copy it so you have

617
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:50,320
to copy basically

618
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:05,360
that's actually a really smart idea it's

619
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,159
um yeah i mean but that's exactly the

620
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,918
kind of help i need

621
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:09,600
so those kind of ideas and that kind of

622
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:10,960
like workflow that solves those issues

623
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:12,799
and i'm going to do that i think

624
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:14,240
like really you know it's really smart

625
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:16,080
and that's actually the amount of

626
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:17,600
users that reach out to me like hey i

627
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,799
know you can't help me recover the data

628
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,480
because i lost the thing but can you

629
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:23,918
help me reset the account yeah

630
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:27,200
and it's like so so and the

631
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:28,480
information is stored on anything so

632
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:30,399
everything is open source you can

633
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:32,640
self-host if you want but we also offer

634
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:35,678
on a hosted solution for two dollars

635
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:37,520
yeah two us a month um so it's not a lot

636
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:39,039
for the west i think and we also by the

637
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:41,120
way do fair pricing so if you're like

638
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:42,559
in india or other low income country we

639
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,279
you know we slash the price fifty

640
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:45,600
percent

641
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:47,440
or whatever okay so do you have many

642
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:50,559
users currently or

643
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:52,080
so because it's open source i mean the

644
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:54,158
paid one we have in the thousands

645
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:56,158
open source you know you look at the

646
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:57,200
downloads or like of the docker image

647
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:59,840
and all of that

648
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:01,919
it can be anything between zero and

649
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:02,799
twenty thousand more i have no idea but

650
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:05,919
i mean just

651
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:07,520
guess completely yeah yeah and also it's

652
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:08,880
packaged by distros so

653
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:10,320
i don't know how many downloads there

654
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,039
are there like it's really difficult to

655
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:13,678
estimate

656
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:14,480
yeah okay is there any particular place

657
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:18,159
that people can

658
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:21,279
go to i don't know that's a good

659
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:21,600
good point that is a good point yeah so

660
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:24,640
just

661
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:25,678
at async.com and but that's more so the

662
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:28,559
moment at the moment the

663
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:29,039
the company like the hosting is kind of

664
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:31,440
pop

665
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:32,320
in distinction indistinguishable from

666
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,000
the

667
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:37,678
open source project i mean it's the same

668
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:39,120
website okay the internet is not working

669
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:41,279
yeah i mean whatever i've had it all day

670
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:43,678
like internet is really bad yeah

671
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:44,720
okay so at async.com at the sync like

672
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:47,919
this

673
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:49,760
yeah and yeah and.com yeah and i have

674
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:53,600
stickers as well actually

675
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:53,600
i have more yeah i should put more

676
00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:01,360
yeah yeah

677
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,719
yeah i mean we have we have an rsc

678
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:05,039
channel you can connect

679
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:06,399
for matrix um we don't have a mailing

680
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:08,799
list but what else we have we have a few

681
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:08,799
other things

682
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:13,440
no and also by the way i'm really it's

683
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:15,039
not that like i think it's a good idea

684
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,919
to do those things i've done some of

685
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:18,158
them and i see

686
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:19,840
that you know the the the ramp up like

687
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:21,120
so many more users stay or for example i

688
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:23,840
added one of those

689
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:25,678
um intercom like but ours is open source

690
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:26,799
based on xmpp blah blah blah

691
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:27,919
but anyhow the moment you have that

692
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:29,200
people actually ask you questions and

693
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:30,559
they retain more so it's all of those

694
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,080
small things that you think like

695
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:33,279
it's not going to matter i need to code

696
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:34,639
more and then you like you do that like

697
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:36,480
oh my god

698
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:37,520
spike so i really know the value of it

699
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,880
this one tried to say it's not going to

700
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,600
be one of those kind of like oh leave me

701
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:42,640
alone

702
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:45,840
uh kind of kind of communities yeah

703
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:47,520
okay yeah cool it was really interesting

704
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,639
oh cool and use it yeah use it by the

705
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,840
way even if you're not interested in

706
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:55,840
helping yeah

707
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:55,840
great cool thank you

708
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:08,960
so did you hear the sort of initial yes

709
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:10,799
i

710
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:12,720
um hi i'm isthman and i'm actually

711
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:14,799
pitching for a friend um

712
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:17,039
who couldn't make it um here's roaming

713
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:23,840
around stuck in another talk

714
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:23,840
um the main thing is

715
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:30,879
so what he created is a um library for

716
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:31,918
collaborative editing so for google docs

717
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:34,240
like

718
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:36,240
um thing and it's really stable now and

719
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:39,120
it's used by a lot of users

720
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:40,480
and i myself i'm a heavy user but what

721
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:44,080
it's completely missing is

722
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:47,120
awareness so making

723
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:48,158
um people aware that other people are

724
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:51,439
using it

725
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:54,559
so it's it scales to

726
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:56,559
dozens of users but it's really hard to

727
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:58,960
follow what is happening for example

728
00:30:56,559 --> 00:31:04,639
there is a um

729
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:08,720
an example here um so you can type

730
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:12,480
text well here

731
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:15,519
um and what we need is

732
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:18,720
some kind of a design system for

733
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:19,519
awareness that goes beyond those basic

734
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,919
ideas that

735
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:23,919
google docs has for example the the

736
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:27,039
colorful animals on the top

737
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:29,440
or the the cursors because um

738
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:32,240
it supports a lot of data types and

739
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:35,279
things for example drawing

740
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:37,919
and already hear um the usual

741
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:39,600
awareness thing so awareness is that you

742
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:40,080
see that others are what others are

743
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:42,799
doing

744
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:44,000
are not working here and we really need

745
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:47,600
ideas

746
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,960
how we can you know get the information

747
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:51,760
to the user that some

748
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:52,799
something happened here made by another

749
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:55,840
user

750
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:56,320
so that would be awesome if um yeah we

751
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:59,279
could

752
00:31:56,320 --> 00:32:00,000
get some help on that there is um

753
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:04,480
information

754
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:06,080
on on yjs.dev and there's a getter

755
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:10,720
there's a discuss

756
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:10,720
and github issues with contacts

757
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:16,960
so just to get a realistic idea if i

758
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:19,918
wanted to

759
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:20,880
join that and collaborate with you how

760
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:23,840
would i do that

761
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:26,399
just go on the website yes.dev and then

762
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:29,678
scroll down it works on mobile

763
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:32,479
and then click the drawing tab and start

764
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:35,120
drawing and then you see

765
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:37,760
somebody's drawing but you don't see who

766
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,760
is drawing

767
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:43,840
are you drawing right now

768
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:48,720
now than this laptop

769
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:57,840
yeah what the the text should work

770
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:57,840
i know yeah yeah it's so

771
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:03,439
you saw that so this magically appeared

772
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:08,640
but

773
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:08,640
we don't know who did it okay

774
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:15,279
yeah some ideas some some design

775
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:19,279
system that that everybody can just use

776
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:25,840
and um yeah so we're ready to implement

777
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:25,840
it but we need ideas

778
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:32,080
or something with colors and then change

779
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:33,600
the colors accordingly

780
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:36,158
also with the text you can use the same

781
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:40,719
colors name the text to the left corner

782
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:44,240
with the label okay

783
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:45,840
oh so so a lot of people are joined up

784
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:53,840
sorry basically

785
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:55,678
you generate automatically a new caller

786
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:58,080
yes you can draw with different colors

787
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:58,080
yourself

788
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:09,199
excuse me well this is

789
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:09,199
this is just a demo so um

790
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:12,000
you can

791
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:22,078
yeah but even if a lot of

792
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:24,078
people are working on google so if

793
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:24,960
you're collaborating and even 10 people

794
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:27,839
are working on

795
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:28,399
at the same time it's really hard to you

796
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:30,480
need to

797
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:35,839
