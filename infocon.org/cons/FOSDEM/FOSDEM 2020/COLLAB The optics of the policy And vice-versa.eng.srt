1
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,719
okay we're

2
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:13,759
ready to get started with our second

3
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:16,800
collaboration session and i'm happy to

4
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:19,119
turn it over to nate wallace

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,119
thanks

6
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:25,039
so this is going to be a first for me in

7
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,439
the sense that

8
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:28,320
um it's intended to be a discussion

9
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:30,000
session

10
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,480
and i'm going to attempt to talk really

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,440
fast uh at the beginning just to sort of

12
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:35,360
lay the groundwork

13
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,800
in case you just got stuck here because

14
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,320
you couldn't get into the dev room you

15
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:42,239
really want to be at

16
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:44,000
um um but if you've been to any like

17
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:46,078
foss events in the past couple years you

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,600
you may have encountered a photo policy

19
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:51,039
which is about um when you should take

20
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,239
photos of other people when you should

21
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:54,800
not and that sort of thing

22
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:56,320
it's a relatively recent innovation in

23
00:00:54,800 --> 00:01:00,559
policy teams

24
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:02,960
um and in my encounters

25
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:04,720
um i've seen some policies that are a

26
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,439
little bit hard to understand

27
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:09,119
and so i sort of thought maybe if we

28
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:10,720
talked in the open about the components

29
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:13,920
of these policies and

30
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:15,439
how you as an event organizer can decide

31
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,560
what you need and what you don't need

32
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:18,559
maybe that would

33
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,320
save some of the growing pains 25

34
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,560
minutes might not be enough

35
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:24,080
to do that and solve all the problems

36
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,560
but we can continue this discussion

37
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,679
later this is really just the opening

38
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:31,439
salvo

39
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:32,960
um clearly clearly these policies are

40
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:34,639
coming from the right place

41
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,079
you know there are people we want

42
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,840
everyone to feel comfortable

43
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:39,600
in our communities either in person or

44
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,439
online

45
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,039
and for some people that can have a lot

46
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:46,240
to do with with their image

47
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:49,520
on the other hand policies are not uh

48
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:51,919
necessarily in their current states

49
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:54,079
easy to to muddle through they tend to

50
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,320
be a little ad hoc these days

51
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:58,158
um maybe a bit disconnected from other

52
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:00,240
other policy decisions

53
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:01,200
um at the events and they can be

54
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,119
confusing

55
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,320
i'm not sure how easy it is to read that

56
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:06,240
if you're at the back of the auditorium

57
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,160
that's from deb conf this year

58
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,598
and it says uh well first of all there's

59
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,160
a camera with the ghostbusters line

60
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:11,760
through it

61
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,840
but then it also says debian will have a

62
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,440
roving photographer capturing both posed

63
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,640
and spontaneous photos to document

64
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,400
devconf

65
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,160
and to use in promotional materials in

66
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,040
the future please respect the wishes of

67
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,280
others

68
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,120
expressed verbally or via the badge when

69
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,400
taking your own photographs

70
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,560
so does that mean the professional

71
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,560
photographer does not have to

72
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,400
this is that's someone else like i have

73
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,400
to respect other people's

74
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,400
badges but debian is also having someone

75
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,080
take their own pictures i don't know i

76
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,959
tried to find out who wrote that policy

77
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,959
and no one really knew

78
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:46,399
this is the short link for a pirate pad

79
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,280
that has sort of the

80
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,160
things that i thought of would be worth

81
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,400
discussing

82
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,840
please feel free to add your own notes

83
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:57,840
to that

84
00:02:53,840 --> 00:03:00,239
i did use an earl stretching service

85
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,840
but like i said we only have 25 minutes

86
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:02,400
here so i'm going to lay out a little

87
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,360
bit of the

88
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,159
the big topics and then open the floor

89
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,760
to

90
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:09,280
everyone who wants to comment or ask

91
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,560
questions um

92
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,239
to me i think the biggest question to

93
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,120
decide if you're an event is whether or

94
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,640
not

95
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,959
you're interested in a photo policy is

96
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:19,200
because of the image itself

97
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:20,480
or because the image is published

98
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,238
somewhere or because it's

99
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,518
associated with a person because those

100
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:25,200
are very different things and they have

101
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:27,519
different different concerns

102
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,119
it's generally not the case that the

103
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:30,720
fact that an image was recorded

104
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,959
is what concerns one although it could

105
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,080
be i mean there are security cameras

106
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:37,680
everywhere

107
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:41,519
but we feel differently when

108
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:43,680
that image gets published right um

109
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:45,599
and and that if that's the case for your

110
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,000
your events then the root issue might be

111
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:48,480
to think

112
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,760
about the policy in terms of tagging

113
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:53,040
people online

114
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:55,040
and about how they're identified or not

115
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,879
identified online rather than making it

116
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:59,519
a photo policy with those other matters

117
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:01,040
being an afterthought

118
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,879
there are several sort of broad

119
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,720
categories where in the in the pirate

120
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:06,798
pad i or the ether pad i just sort of

121
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,920
put more specifics and i'll talk about

122
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:12,159
these

123
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:16,079
um one at a time uh scoping which is

124
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:18,320
a word i borrowed from tom um generally

125
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,840
if there's a if there's a declaration

126
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,918
for someone to make as

127
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:23,440
their photo preferences it's done with a

128
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:24,880
device on the badge somehow either the

129
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,520
lanyard or a sticker or something like

130
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,440
that

131
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,120
but you also see this where there's sort

132
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:31,199
of sections of a room

133
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,600
and it's important to be clear i think

134
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:36,240
how those interact if you move

135
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,360
from one into the other with what are

136
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,520
you expressing when you

137
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,360
have the don't take my photo picture

138
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:44,320
photo badge but you sit in the

139
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:46,000
photo zero case section uh it's either

140
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,680
you know one of those options is okay

141
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,160
you just need to be clear about that

142
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,919
but you also have similar issues come up

143
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,360
with what happens in the q a period

144
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:55,520
there's someone with a no

145
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,120
photo thing should they not be recorded

146
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,960
by the video team

147
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,039
and does this supply can you be a

148
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:04,159
volunteer and a staff person

149
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:06,080
and a room proctor and and not um

150
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,320
have people take your photo this you

151
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:10,000
know a lot of variables to be uh

152
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:12,639
to be managed there in drafting your

153
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,240
policy uh there's also the issue of how

154
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:15,199
the photo policy interacts with other

155
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,360
things

156
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:19,039
in most cases i can tell you codes of

157
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,039
conduct do not mention

158
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:22,479
the photography policy sometimes they're

159
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:23,680
both available on the website but they

160
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:26,719
don't really seem to connect

161
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,280
is it the same policy is it a section of

162
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,120
it

163
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:32,080
i noticed the libra flyknit code of

164
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:35,120
conduct does mention

165
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:36,639
uh photographic harassment as an example

166
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,639
of bad behavior

167
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,759
but it's not the same thing as the photo

168
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,759
policy

169
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:43,680
and there's also things to consider like

170
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,960
if you are agreeing to be a speaker you

171
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,720
have some sort of release

172
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,799
generally does that mean you don't have

173
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:51,440
the right to

174
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:53,199
make other decisions about photographs

175
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,639
and in some cases there's something

176
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:56,400
what we would call a general release

177
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:58,240
which is if you're in a you're going to

178
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,840
public events if you're going to

179
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,000
a sporting event for example there's

180
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,440
some sort of release somewhere that you

181
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,600
agreed to when you bought a ticket that

182
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,160
says hey people might take your picture

183
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,639
here

184
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:10,560
so harmonizing those things is a topic

185
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,960
all into itself

186
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,400
there's also the issue of we want to

187
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,440
write policies that are clear but not

188
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,599
overly complex

189
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,639
that is from guadec last year you'll see

190
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,360
there's

191
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:21,919
three different badge colors available

192
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,680
uh

193
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:25,120
i'm okay with pictures i'm not okay with

194
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:28,400
pictures and please

195
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:30,319
ask um it might be that three is too

196
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:32,638
many it might be that you could just say

197
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:33,919
by default ask and then you only need

198
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:36,240
two badges

199
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:37,758
so that that can get to be confusing for

200
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,160
people which

201
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:40,880
is not what we want uh and then there's

202
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,440
the issue of

203
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,080
we need to balance the policy that

204
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,000
someone

205
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:49,440
writes as sort of an event-wide thing

206
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,280
with the differing needs of individual

207
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,560
groups that participate in the event

208
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,280
like this is

209
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,639
a snippet from an email from the events

210
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,559
team where i was a speaker and they're

211
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:01,680
like hey you need to send us a picture

212
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,240
it's important and i push back on this

213
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,759
quite a bit

214
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:07,199
just to see what happens um and

215
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,039
you know eventually i got a letter from

216
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:10,639
the executive director saying

217
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:13,039
it's actually fine if you don't want to

218
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:14,960
send a picture in but the event wants to

219
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:17,360
put your picture online if you're a

220
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:20,159
speaker and that's understandable

221
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:22,240
the press sometimes if it's an event

222
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,599
like this where no one registers

223
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,960
people might just come because they're

224
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:25,919
the local media and they record

225
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,560
something

226
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:30,080
in other cases you have to invite people

227
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,520
to come

228
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,960
give your coverage give your event

229
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,318
coverage in that case you've kind of

230
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,758
entered into a relationship where they

231
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:38,000
have some expectations about

232
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:39,759
being able to do their job so those are

233
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,759
important concerns to balance as well

234
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:43,360
and the last one there is

235
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,199
if someone's travel to the event is

236
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:48,080
sponsored we frequently tell them

237
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:48,879
write a blog post at the end and tell us

238
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:52,159
you were there so

239
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:53,919
making sure that we are clear about

240
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,759
them taking pictures when they're told

241
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:58,878
they're required to take pictures

242
00:07:55,759 --> 00:08:02,319
is a also covered

243
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:05,280
finally there may be policies

244
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:06,160
by the venue or in public spaces it may

245
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,599
not be clear

246
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,599
if i'm in a public space if i'm out

247
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:11,520
there or if i'm in the venue space

248
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:12,878
so these are things you may not have

249
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:16,080
legal grounds

250
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:17,120
as an event to say this applies to

251
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:20,159
people on a campus

252
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,680
who are not part of fosdem i i don't

253
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,720
think that fosdem could unilaterally

254
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,160
declare that

255
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:27,039
other people wandering through campus

256
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:30,560
have to abide by the photo policy

257
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:31,440
and the last thing is just clarity in

258
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,958
what you write

259
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:35,039
what does it mean exactly for someone to

260
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:36,000
be in a photo or even to be identifiable

261
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,199
in a photo

262
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,200
you might have seen this this was back

263
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,279
in march i think where a man sued mit

264
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:44,399
for using his photo without permission

265
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:45,680
it was in the the best of all ironies it

266
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,800
was an article about hipsters all

267
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,399
looking the same

268
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,079
turns out it was someone else and it was

269
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,959
not him so there's going to be

270
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,600
disagreements

271
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:54,160
and it's important to to account for

272
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,920
what does

273
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,279
identifiable mean and then how do we

274
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,680
decide

275
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:00,640
uh and i think one final thing i wanted

276
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,800
to mention there is

277
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:04,480
uh record keeping does anyone remember

278
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,800
what color lanyard

279
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,640
from the guadex slide a few slides ago

280
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:11,199
was the one that meant okay

281
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,800
take my picture yeah so if you're

282
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,360
looking at pictures from from two years

283
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,439
ago

284
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,560
the lanyard color might not be enough to

285
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:20,240
make that a real

286
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:22,079
usable policy um

287
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,680
those are all the introductory comments

288
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,240
i have to make

289
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:27,839
here again is the the link to the either

290
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:30,000
pad if you want to add your own comments

291
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:33,279
or weigh in on things or provide

292
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,640
informational links i'm aware that

293
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:36,560
a lot of the time we have is already

294
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,080
gone so

295
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,599
i asked some friends of mine who run

296
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,920
pixels us which is a

297
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,279
discussion forum for open source

298
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,800
software projects that deal with

299
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:47,920
photography like

300
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:52,000
uh dark table and raw editors

301
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:53,519
and and that sort of thing they have a

302
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,120
discourse for them i think it's

303
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:56,720
discourse

304
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,240
whichever one is actually free software

305
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:01,600
that's the one it is and

306
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:03,120
they set up a sort of legal category and

307
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,040
uh if anyone is interested in having

308
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,079
this discussion further i think that

309
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,760
would be a

310
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:09,359
worthwhile place to do it because some

311
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,480
of these questions that are very photo

312
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,040
centric

313
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,839
the photography community has dealt with

314
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,920
before like

315
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:18,079
what does it mean for someone to be

316
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:20,319
visible in a photo or not

317
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:22,239
those are all the introductory comments

318
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,079
i have so i would like to open the floor

319
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,920
up for questions

320
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:27,839
and comments and that definitely

321
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,719
includes me clarifying things that i

322
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:32,079
said

323
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:34,800
in the preceding few minutes so the

324
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:34,800
floor is yours

325
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:50,399
okay thank you very much you brought uh

326
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,440
quite an interesting and underestimated

327
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:55,120
topic i just

328
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:58,000
want to add a few comments

329
00:10:55,120 --> 00:11:00,640
um the first because also because of my

330
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,120
private practice i had the

331
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:05,680
fun experience to draft a photography

332
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:09,760
policy for a cosplay event of the

333
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:13,040
throne of game of thrones for a public

334
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:16,160
library but i would

335
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:19,519
say that one thing

336
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:22,399
we have to consider you mentioned gdpr

337
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:23,279
but apart from gdpr you we have to

338
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:26,640
consider

339
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:30,480
also freedom of information so

340
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:32,720
if if okay photography for documenting

341
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,480
the event is one thing you can object

342
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,240
and things like that but

343
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,399
when it comes to freedom information

344
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,120
just people informing that there is a

345
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:41,680
conference

346
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,640
there's then other consideration came

347
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:45,439
into play

348
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:46,800
and the second point i would still

349
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:50,079
consider

350
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:52,880
is the fact that of course you are

351
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:54,959
dealing only with the topic of pictures

352
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:57,760
taken by the organization

353
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:59,920
but there is also the topic of picture

354
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:03,200
taken by other attendees and then

355
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:07,199
shared on social networks if

356
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:09,120
you just do it as a on a personal base

357
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:11,519
then you are protected by the house of

358
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:14,160
the exemption under the gdpr

359
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:16,000
but as long as you share it well things

360
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:19,519
can get a little tricky

361
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,519
what do you think about right um so

362
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:24,560
that is a good point i did not intend

363
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:28,000
for the the list of topics to be limited

364
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:29,839
to official photographers

365
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,040
by the events because generally the

366
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:35,279
policy is written

367
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:36,959
as something for events attendees

368
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:39,279
and if there is an exception there's an

369
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:41,680
exception carved out for

370
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:43,439
the staff people and for a professional

371
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:46,239
event photographer but my i

372
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:48,160
want this this topic to encompass

373
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:51,200
everything because i think that

374
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:53,439
um like you said where it gets nebulous

375
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,480
is the people who are there for their

376
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,760
own private purposes

377
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:59,440
and take pictures of their friends um

378
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:01,120
it's a weird it's a weird thing to ask

379
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,720
people that they have to get permission

380
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:06,240
from their friends to take

381
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:06,639
the pictures like yeah and what you said

382
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,959
about

383
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:13,200
um freedom of information

384
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:14,479
um that raises another another thing

385
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,920
that i was

386
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:18,560
wanting to bring up which is that there

387
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:21,360
are people for whom the notion of saying

388
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:24,479
don't take my picture this event

389
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:26,240
feels incongruous

390
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,560
with the notion that we're here to have

391
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:31,600
a free and open

392
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:35,279
community event and so

393
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:38,320
reaching that person and and saying

394
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:40,800
um yes we are working in the open

395
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,760
but in this case please don't mention

396
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,479
this person's name

397
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:45,760
it can be tricky or mention this

398
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:49,519
person's name or their picture

399
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:52,959
and did that

400
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:55,360
address okay

401
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:55,359
rules

402
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:04,319
hey to be uh maybe a little bit

403
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:07,440
provocative or whatever

404
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:09,920
um these

405
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,480
are photo policies of sort of starting

406
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:13,120
to be

407
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,920
come around in the last year too i

408
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,160
assume

409
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:18,160
maybe concerns about facial recognition

410
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,880
and so forth is driving at least some of

411
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:21,680
it

412
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:23,360
but you know it almost seems to me kind

413
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:25,599
of realistically

414
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,480
yes you could essentially just ban

415
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,959
photography

416
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:30,000
events or you know photography only of

417
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:33,760
speakers

418
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:38,079
but is a practical policy

419
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:40,800
even doable beyond that or is this

420
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:42,000
or does this really boil down to you

421
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,800
know if they're almost sort of a

422
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,079
feel-good

423
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:47,680
type of thing of people think they can

424
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:49,120
be kept from being photographed in

425
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:51,760
reality they're going to be in lots of

426
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:54,079
photographs at any given event

427
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,800
well i'm not a liar but this to me feels

428
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:57,279
like

429
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:59,359
where a lawyer would bring up the notion

430
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:03,360
of like reasonable expectations

431
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:06,399
it's like we know we can't proactively

432
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,040
prevent people from behaving badly but

433
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:09,040
we can

434
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,319
set expectations in a code of conduct

435
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:12,719
policy

436
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,680
and then generally lay out the terms of

437
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,959
what we expect

438
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:19,599
and it's a good point that like maybe

439
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:20,160
in some of the earliest codes of conduct

440
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,040
that i saw

441
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:24,240
events adopt they spend a lot more time

442
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,920
trying to express

443
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:28,000
the full set of what's okay and what's

444
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:30,959
not okay and that was

445
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,560
sort of not helpful it was a lot more

446
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:34,800
helpful to

447
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:37,518
set the general terms and then devote

448
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:39,439
more energy into

449
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:40,880
responding to incidents and explaining

450
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,560
people how to report incidents and that

451
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:44,160
sort of thing so i would think it's in

452
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:47,279
the same category

453
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:50,639
where maybe getting too too detailed on

454
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:54,160
the the photography issues itself is

455
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:57,360
not money well spent but

456
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:59,040
um setting the expectations at a

457
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:02,160
community level and then

458
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:05,360
having mechanisms in place to

459
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,680
handle the disagreements that can come

460
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:08,959
up

461
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:12,479
is the uh

462
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:12,479
more beneficial approach maybe

463
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,759
hi um so it seems from everything you've

464
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:23,600
presented that these policies are both

465
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:25,120
rather difficult to draft also rather

466
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:28,079
difficult to implement

467
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:29,440
and can have some ambiguities or even

468
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:31,359
inconsistencies and might

469
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,560
lead people to have certain expectations

470
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:35,120
as to what is or isn't

471
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:36,800
permit being permitted and that those

472
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,240
expectations might be frustrated in a

473
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,758
way that leaves people perhaps more

474
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,279
disappointed than they would be

475
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:43,360
if those expectations weren't there in

476
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:45,680
the first place which is to ask

477
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:47,680
have any studies been conducted as to

478
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,800
the effect of having these policies in

479
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,638
place at all does it increase

480
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,519
participation does it increase diversity

481
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:54,079
participation

482
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:55,040
do people approve of them and enjoy them

483
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:56,638
or have they

484
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:58,079
perhaps created more frustration than

485
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:59,600
they've solved

486
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:03,040
i have no idea and that's a good

487
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,040
question and

488
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:06,720
i guess i would hope that someone who's

489
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,160
taking notes can

490
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,760
add that to the ether pad before i

491
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:12,799
forget to do so

492
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:13,280
but yeah since i i view this session as

493
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:15,679
sort of

494
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:18,160
a attempt to start the discussion i hope

495
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:21,360
that we can maybe look into that

496
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:24,959
um of the events that i regularly go to

497
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:28,079
um guadec has a posted photo policy

498
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:28,799
and has had one for i think three years

499
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:31,918
ish

500
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:34,080
somewhere like somewhere and like i

501
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:35,600
mentioned the dead confident was seemed

502
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:38,480
very ad hoc

503
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:39,520
and and a little bit confusing um but i

504
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,360
do know because

505
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,879
because guadac has been doing this that

506
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,840
there are other events that have done

507
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:48,960
this and they may have

508
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:52,799
um they may have some data anecdotal or

509
00:17:48,960 --> 00:18:01,840
you know numeric we'll see good point

510
00:17:52,799 --> 00:18:01,840
we have five minutes or slightly less

511
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:06,400
well speaking not in legal terms but

512
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:09,039
mostly in principle terms

513
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:10,799
i i see that the freedom of some people

514
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:12,160
not being i mean not to be photographed

515
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:14,000
but don't you think that there's also a

516
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,840
freedom for everybody else to be able

517
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,080
actually to share experiences of a

518
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:20,720
public conference and to

519
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:21,600
send photos to friends to send group

520
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,120
photos and

521
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,799
and even other organizers to document

522
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,199
what's happening keep it recorded so i

523
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:28,240
mean

524
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,280
in these policies often i see a lot of

525
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,960
emphasis on

526
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,320
on the privacy side but not a lot of

527
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,360
emphasis on the fact that it's a public

528
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,120
event and there's

529
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:37,199
actually a legitimate interest of other

530
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,918
people to share they share the content

531
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:41,200
and

532
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:43,440
so the the door was closing there and

533
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,640
you're you're asking no i was asking

534
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,600
your opinion on this so

535
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,200
don't you think that there should be

536
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,000
also some attention in protecting the

537
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,520
right of

538
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,120
people that have no problem being

539
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,840
photographed and actually want to share

540
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:55,280
content from

541
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:56,879
from the event yeah i think so

542
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,480
also because by the way i think there

543
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,000
are a few people that have a real need

544
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,919
and not to be photographed like mr

545
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,400
blowers or these kind of people

546
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:05,440
and if we end up in a situation in which

547
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,520
half of the room

548
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:09,120
asked not to be photographed the result

549
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:11,039
will be that the people that really have

550
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:13,840
a real need we will just be

551
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:14,640
lost in a bigger crowd and maybe people

552
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,399
will just

553
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,760
say screw it and photograph everyone and

554
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,840
then the people that are really

555
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:21,360
quick that's that would be an

556
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:24,000
undesirable outcome but

557
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:25,439
yeah it's potentially yeah i think i i

558
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:30,000
agree it's definitely about

559
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:30,000
balancing and not about

560
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:34,480
declaring so it's about balancing the

561
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:38,080
needs of the

562
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:40,640
different groups

563
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,639
anyone else

564
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:47,360
alrighty well i i thank you for your

565
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,240
attention and

566
