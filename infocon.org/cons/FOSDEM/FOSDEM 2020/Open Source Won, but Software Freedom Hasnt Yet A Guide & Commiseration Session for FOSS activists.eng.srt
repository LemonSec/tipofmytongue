1
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:08,399
hi everyone

2
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:14,639
i'm karen sandler and i'm bradley [ __ ]

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,160
and we are so happy to be here at fosdem

4
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:19,600
with you

5
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:23,439
uh we both are did you move forward

6
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:26,240
i see uh hi uh we are both um

7
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:27,759
we both work at the software freedom

8
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,880
conservancy

9
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,439
raise your hand if you've heard of

10
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:34,559
software freedom conservancy it's about

11
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:38,160
yay it's about half of the room we are

12
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:39,760
a charity organized to promote free and

13
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:43,760
open source software

14
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:45,199
we are focused on the ethical and i i

15
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,600
just have to stop for a second and tell

16
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,760
you

17
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,840
everybody that the sound here in this

18
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,399
room is extremely challenging

19
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,760
so you get like a little bit of an echo

20
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:57,360
and in particular

21
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:59,199
during the the q a sections

22
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,039
you cannot hear any of the people

23
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:01,519
questioning so i just saw frank give his

24
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:03,280
talk

25
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,040
and he kept trying to lean over to hear

26
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,760
what everyone said because it's so

27
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,000
awkward and

28
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,119
anyway i just wanted to just stop for a

29
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,680
minute and uh

30
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:13,920
and just mention that because uh hearing

31
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,880
my own echo is a little confusing

32
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,960
anyway i'll kick it to you bradley for a

33
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:22,560
minute

34
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:24,720
so we spend a lot of time trying to do

35
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,920
the right thing for free software

36
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:29,039
and we try to live a life in software

37
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,960
freedom

38
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,200
last year the organizers were kind

39
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,679
enough to invite us to give a keynote

40
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,840
talk

41
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,520
where we spoke a lot about that and a

42
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,759
lot about the challenges

43
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:41,200
today what we'd like to do is give you a

44
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:43,759
follow-up on that and

45
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,240
really lay out some concrete plans of

46
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:47,439
how

47
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:49,520
we as a community can approach

48
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:51,119
this question of how do we do what's

49
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,119
right for software freedom

50
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:55,119
how do we live a life in software

51
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:59,119
freedom in what is becoming

52
00:01:55,119 --> 00:02:01,759
an increasingly challenging world

53
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:02,960
of course it is very very difficult to

54
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:05,680
be purists now

55
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:07,679
and in fact it is difficult for me to

56
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:10,399
ever be a purist at all

57
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,760
i have a pacemaker defibrillator because

58
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:13,680
i have a heart condition

59
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,879
and i can't see the source code in my

60
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,200
own body

61
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:19,120
this is the whole reason why i have

62
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,760
become so passionate about software

63
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,560
freedom

64
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,359
because when you realize that you have

65
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,680
no control

66
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,200
over the software that is literally sewn

67
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,080
into your body and screwed into your

68
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,480
heart

69
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,640
you start to see all of your technology

70
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:36,560
a little bit differently

71
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:40,000
and having this um this

72
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:43,440
this struggle with proprietary software

73
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,480
um really flushes out all of the issues

74
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:48,079
um that uh that we face so uh again we

75
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:50,640
talked about we're not gonna repeat the

76
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:55,120
talk we gave last year um

77
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:55,679
it it was the summary of all of the

78
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,720
thinking

79
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,440
of a year ago and today we are going to

80
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,760
tell you

81
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,120
about all of the work that we've been

82
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:06,480
doing over the last year

83
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:08,800
and where things stand now so one of the

84
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,959
things that we have tried to do

85
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,000
and we want to do is to provide moral

86
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:14,720
leadership

87
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,400
about software freedom we believe in

88
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:19,200
ethics of morality we believe

89
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,159
that ethics and morality are a central

90
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,000
component

91
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:24,560
of why most of us are here because we

92
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,080
have things that we believe in

93
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,920
i've been thinking quite a bit over the

94
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,239
last year in part because of this

95
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,440
television show and i apologize if

96
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:32,000
people don't like examples from

97
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,920
television

98
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,159
shows but if you will make an exception

99
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,679
for one this show called the good place

100
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:40,239
is probably worth it

101
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,519
it is the first time i've ever seen deep

102
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:44,720
moral philosophy

103
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:47,760
addressed through a comedic lens

104
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,480
in the history of television raise your

105
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,760
hand if you've

106
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,480
seen the good place we have a large

107
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,679
audience and

108
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,200
half the people have seen it well that's

109
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,360
good to know because it makes our

110
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,599
examples much easier to explain

111
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,640
so this main character here his name is

112
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:03,280
chidi and

113
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:05,679
it's not a spoiler to know that he is a

114
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,879
moral ethicist by a training he's a phd

115
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,799
in philosophy

116
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:11,439
and spends his time thinking about moral

117
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:13,200
questions in this particular scene

118
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:14,720
he's spending about an hour and a half

119
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:17,519
to decide which

120
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:19,358
muffin to buy for breakfast the reason

121
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,399
he spends an hour and a half considering

122
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:22,479
this question

123
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:23,679
is because he's considering the entire

124
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:25,919
long chain

125
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:28,080
of moral decisions that occur to bring

126
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:31,198
this muffin to this little stand here

127
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,800
near his university in australia he's

128
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:34,880
trying to decide

129
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,800
what is the most environmentally

130
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:39,040
conscious muffin to buy

131
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,160
what is the most properly resourced

132
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,080
muffin to buy

133
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,360
what is the waste stream questions with

134
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:47,198
regards to the wrapper

135
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:50,479
that the muffin is in and this kind of

136
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:52,800
moral freeze that constantly occurs

137
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:54,240
for people who care a lot about morality

138
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,479
particularly people who focus

139
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,520
from a what's called a conscient from a

140
00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:00,960
manual kant

141
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:03,359
ethics point of view is very difficult

142
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,400
and historically i've noticed upon

143
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,400
reviewing

144
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,799
the history of moral philosophy of free

145
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:11,919
software over the last few years

146
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:14,960
that the influence of emanuel kant

147
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:17,599
and conscient ethics uh may have been

148
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:19,840
a bit overdone now i was a huge fan of

149
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:22,479
emanuel kant when i first read his work

150
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:24,400
as an undergraduate at university but

151
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:27,039
later i saw this uh uh

152
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,880
this movie and broadway show um called

153
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:32,159
hedwig and the angry inch which

154
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:35,199
can this quote from that uh show

155
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:37,039
convinced me that perhaps we have spent

156
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:40,000
a little too much time

157
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:41,199
allowing kant to always get what he

158
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,840
wants

159
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:44,639
there's other ways and other methods to

160
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:47,919
look

161
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:50,479
at how we engage in morality yeah and i

162
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:52,880
think that when we think about the

163
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:53,919
the moral leadership of free and open

164
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:57,120
source software

165
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:57,758
we see that things have been coming to a

166
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,600
head

167
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:01,440
um there have been different ways of

168
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:05,039
thinking about software freedom

169
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:07,919
and um the quite a lot

170
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:09,599
of the controversy that we have had in

171
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:12,318
the last year as referenced by

172
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,919
frank in his last talk um have centered

173
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:17,440
around this idea of

174
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:20,400
ethical licenses and it's this idea that

175
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:21,919
we have we've we've chosen to address

176
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:25,280
some of our social issues

177
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:28,000
with software freedom and with copyleft

178
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,638
and free software licensing generally

179
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,680
and

180
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:33,919
there's a group of people who want to

181
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,960
use that theory to apply it to other

182
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:37,120
spaces

183
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,560
and it's completely reasonable to think

184
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:41,520
this because

185
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,560
we have as a movement been really going

186
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:45,198
out there saying

187
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,880
that our movement has this philosophical

188
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:49,360
and ethical component

189
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,800
and yet at the same time i think it's

190
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,440
been our historic

191
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,000
failure to lead as a movement that has

192
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,319
caused

193
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,240
some of this division that we have today

194
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:00,560
because we have failed to connect

195
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,240
software freedom with some of our other

196
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,400
philosophical problems

197
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,000
we sort of wind up in the situation that

198
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:08,318
we're we're in today

199
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,599
where we have to figure out where where

200
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:11,440
we are and what are

201
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:12,800
the underpinnings of what we're doing

202
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,719
yeah in some sense we've been standing

203
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,680
deciding which muffin to buy while other

204
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,479
people have been

205
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:20,319
coming forward saying well which moral

206
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:22,318
question

207
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:24,000
are you most interested in and they're

208
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:25,599
more interested in climate change and

209
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,360
other issues which we think are

210
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:30,080
incredibly important

211
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,520
and they see natural alliance with

212
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:34,800
software freedom

213
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:36,159
and their first effort to build that

214
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,479
alliance is to say well we're going to

215
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,800
use

216
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:39,599
licenses just like you did to chase

217
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,960
those issues

218
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:42,880
and we haven't built the kind of

219
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:45,599
coalitions that we

220
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:47,120
had hoped we would build historically uh

221
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:48,479
in part because we've spent a lot of

222
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,960
time thinking about uh

223
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:51,840
relatively simplistic moral questions

224
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:54,239
instead of

225
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,280
looking at the complexity here's a scene

226
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,960
from the good place where they're

227
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:59,198
considering what is called by moral

228
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:02,080
philosophers the trolley problem

229
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:02,800
you're on a train moving quickly down a

230
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,039
track

231
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,800
you have a track switch option but if

232
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:08,719
you go one way you are sure

233
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:11,280
to murder a single person who is tied to

234
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:13,280
the tracks and if you turn the other way

235
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,719
you're likely to seriously injure a

236
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,479
number of people who

237
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,759
are attempting to repair the tracks

238
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:19,599
although there's some chance they might

239
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:22,000
be able to get out of the way

240
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:23,280
and this kind of moral question is very

241
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,520
good to teach students

242
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,559
about how to consider more philosophy

243
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:29,758
questions

244
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:31,520
but in the real world things are

245
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,279
not always that simple although in some

246
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,718
cases maybe they are i was going to say

247
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,479
you know i

248
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:38,800
when i look at the issues around my

249
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:39,839
heart device some of those are very life

250
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:41,519
and death

251
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:43,599
i guess the closest equivalent to my

252
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:45,600
trolley problem is that if i

253
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:46,880
refuse to get proprietary software in my

254
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,839
body

255
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:51,120
i'm sort of choosing between getting a

256
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:54,080
device

257
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:56,000
that might kill me or not getting a

258
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,600
device that would save me maybe

259
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,040
and sort of not knowing what the result

260
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,959
of that is but either case

261
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,800
could result in death and at the end of

262
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:05,199
the day you know it's

263
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,640
a it's a it's a life or death situation

264
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,399
and of course the question of whether

265
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:10,959
you can actually examine the source code

266
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:12,480
of that device is salient because

267
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:14,399
you can't assure yourself further that

268
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,680
it's safe because you can't review it

269
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:18,240
that's right and one of the things that

270
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:21,040
i mentioned last year is that

271
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,440
often these devices are not necessarily

272
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,920
made

273
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,800
for the use cases in which they're

274
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,920
deployed

275
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:30,719
so for example when i was

276
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:32,319
pregnant my defibrillator thought that

277
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,560
my palpitation which is

278
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,600
totally normal in a pregnant woman was a

279
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:38,239
dangerous rhythm

280
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,760
and it shocked me unnecessarily i

281
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:42,959
totally didn't need that shock

282
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:43,680
but it shocked me to to save me multiple

283
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:45,518
times

284
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,439
and the only way i could get it to stop

285
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,920
was by taking drugs to lower my heart

286
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,360
rate

287
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,360
so much that it was hard to walk up a

288
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:54,160
flight of stairs and

289
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,440
you know it's one of those situations

290
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:58,640
where

291
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:00,959
you know no one had a bad intention

292
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,000
right the the people who work for device

293
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:04,319
manufacturers

294
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,079
are are people who are working on

295
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,640
devices that are meant to help people

296
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:08,560
right

297
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,319
and it's a total nightmare to have

298
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:13,599
pregnant women getting shocked

299
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:15,440
but my used case wasn't necessarily an

300
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,560
anticipated use case which stands for

301
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,640
the proposition

302
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:20,800
that all of our technology will be

303
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:23,279
deployed in unexpected ways

304
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:24,880
what else will be using our devices for

305
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:26,240
that haven't been anticipated by their

306
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:28,959
makers

307
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,279
so last year we talked extensively about

308
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:31,040
the

309
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:33,040
question of proprietary javascript

310
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,920
particularly in relationship to google

311
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,920
maps

312
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:37,760
we got a tremendous amount of useful

313
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,519
feedback where people pointed out that

314
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:42,399
well there's all these great

315
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:43,519
street open street map-based mapping

316
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:45,920
applications

317
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:47,839
we took the feedback seriously but even

318
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:49,519
when we dig down it's like the onion

319
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:50,959
where you peel away and the next thing

320
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:53,519
is just another layer

321
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:55,040
again we discover even if you get the

322
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:56,640
free software replacement

323
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,319
you're still trapped by certain

324
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:00,640
proprietary software in the same

325
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,760
way after that talk i started using us

326
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:04,800
man a lot more

327
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:07,120
which is uh which is made such great

328
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:09,680
beeps and bounds and it's fantastic but

329
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:11,120
without using the gps drivers i still

330
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,920
have a lot of the same problems i had

331
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,279
before

332
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:15,120
and there's of course lots of other

333
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:16,000
proprietary bits in there too that i try

334
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,440
to avoid

335
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,920
right and when you begin to look all the

336
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,560
way down the stack in any device these

337
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,240
days

338
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:24,399
uh even if you've replaced the

339
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:26,399
application layer with free software

340
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:28,000
you find proprietary software in your

341
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:30,160
firmware you find proprietary

342
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,360
software in the broadband or the um the

343
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:35,120
mobile network uh

344
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:37,279
firmwares and so this problem is so

345
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,880
complicated and it is basically as we

346
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:41,600
said last year impossible

347
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:43,439
to use completely free software a new

348
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:46,000
problem i discovered in the recent

349
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:47,440
in the last year this is extremely

350
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,320
common in the united states

351
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,560
i hope it's not common in europe yet but

352
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,600
it

353
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:54,560
is coming if it is not here yet so this

354
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,040
is a sign from

355
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:58,800
a local grocery store near me and you'll

356
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:00,079
notice the word digital deals well what

357
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:03,519
that means is

358
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:06,560
there are now certain coupons discounts

359
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:08,959
that you can only receive

360
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:10,719
from a grocery store if you have their

361
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:11,680
proprietary software application

362
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,519
installed

363
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:15,040
and if of course you've authenticated

364
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:17,120
with your personal data

365
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:19,040
so there's not only a proprietary

366
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:22,720
software component there's a

367
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:24,399
data privacy component and

368
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,160
when i think about the question of well

369
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:28,560
you know okay i'm i'm a

370
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,439
privileged person who doesn't have the

371
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,439
absolute need to

372
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:33,839
chase every sale although i was raised

373
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:36,160
to always find the best price and

374
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:37,040
use every coupon you can find so it's in

375
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,920
my

376
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,800
basic dna to search for the discount but

377
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:43,519
i think about

378
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,240
poor people underprivileged people who

379
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:47,680
are now

380
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:49,760
forced to find a device to use

381
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:51,199
which they may not be able to afford to

382
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,959
get these discounts

383
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,800
and of course their privacy is being

384
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:58,000
compromised and everything else

385
00:12:54,800 --> 00:13:01,599
so we're in a situation where the

386
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,320
the this freight train of uh proprietary

387
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,720
software

388
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,600
and data privacy are just running right

389
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,079
into each other

390
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,200
it's very similar to what happened with

391
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:12,638
drm

392
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:14,399
so we had this moment about 15 years ago

393
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:16,160
where there was a question of whether we

394
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:18,880
were going to accept drm

395
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:20,639
on free software devices there was kind

396
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,439
of two camps there was one camp that

397
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:23,760
said well

398
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,800
we would really like to be able to use

399
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,760
netflix on

400
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:29,040
linux uh and that wasn't possible and

401
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:31,120
there was another camp

402
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:32,240
i was in this one of course which said

403
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,959
no we should

404
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:36,480
stand against drm we shouldn't have it

405
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:37,920
on linux based systems

406
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,519
even if it means we don't get as much

407
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:42,079
adoption we should take a stand

408
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:43,040
in the end drm has won and became

409
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:46,399
ubiquitous

410
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:48,399
we're having a very similar crash of

411
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:51,279
privacy and data rights and proprietary

412
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:53,680
software if this app were free software

413
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:54,639
uh that i download onto an android

414
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:57,760
device

415
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:59,839
i could modify it to remove the privacy

416
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:01,040
compromising stuff and still have it

417
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,639
work with the coupons

418
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,240
i'd figure out a way i'm sure i'm a good

419
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:05,680
enough programmer to do that

420
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:07,600
of course they are not going to give me

421
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:09,199
the source code to this application

422
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,959
because they know that's what i would

423
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:12,240
want to do with it

424
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:13,760
that i'd want to be able to use the

425
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,560
coupons without giving up my data

426
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,399
privacy

427
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:18,160
so we're in a really tough problem and

428
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:19,839
this is impacting

429
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:21,040
the underprivileged much more than the

430
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:22,320
privilege because they're the

431
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,160
underprivileged people are the ones who

432
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,079
need these discounts the most

433
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:29,360
and really we should be making sure they

434
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:29,359
can get them and here they can't

435
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:33,680
so it's not surprising to hear that uh

436
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,399
when i refer to a relatively recent

437
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:39,199
pregnancy that i have little kids

438
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:41,199
um and we went on a family trip to

439
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:44,000
disneyland

440
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:45,199
i see some reaction to disneyland i feel

441
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,240
exactly the same way

442
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:51,680
uh disney is uh is certainly

443
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,800
a uh a problematic actor when it comes

444
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:55,839
to a variety

445
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:56,639
of subjects however when you have little

446
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:58,160
kids

447
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:00,000
it's really fun to take them to

448
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:02,319
disneyland

449
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,279
and we plan for this trip we happen to

450
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:06,720
be in

451
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:09,040
um in la for a family event

452
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,839
and we decided to go to disneyland it's

453
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:12,480
expensive

454
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:13,760
to go to disneyland and so we saved up

455
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,480
our money to go

456
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:17,439
and um and we made our plans in advance

457
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:20,000
um

458
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,639
this is one of those things where you

459
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,839
know

460
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:25,680
the the example that your parents

461
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:28,480
set for you sometimes really influences

462
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:32,079
you and my mother

463
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:34,399
is a very serious planner type

464
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:35,599
and so when she took me to disneyland

465
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:38,399
when i was a kid

466
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,040
she did all of the research that she

467
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:41,920
could do

468
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:43,759
she planned a route through the park she

469
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:45,519
was amazing what we would eat what we

470
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:47,519
would do so that we would make the most

471
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:50,240
of our day and have the best time

472
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:51,040
and for me you know i feel that that

473
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,880
pressure to

474
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:54,480
also step up and give my kids the same

475
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:56,959
experience and so

476
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:59,279
i did the same thing and i did all of

477
00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:01,599
this research i planned it out i spent

478
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:02,720
way longer than i should have i have a

479
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,079
lot of things to do

480
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,600
but i spent way longer than i should

481
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:07,920
have going and i bought we bought the

482
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,839
tickets in advance we were all set to go

483
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:13,519
we get there and i remember

484
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:15,600
that the ticket said something about how

485
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:17,199
with that kind of ticket you had the

486
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:21,199
ability to skip

487
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:23,758
some lines uh some cues in the park

488
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:24,240
and the lines for rides at disneyland

489
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:27,440
can be

490
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:30,880
very very long and now

491
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:34,160
everybody here is probably aware that

492
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:36,240
given our talk so far that i won't put

493
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,600
unnecessary proprietary software on my

494
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,440
phone so

495
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:41,120
of course and i don't have the ability

496
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:44,320
to do it on the fly anyway

497
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:46,560
and so when i found out that disneyland

498
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:49,680
requires their proprietary app

499
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:50,239
in order to skip the lines i was like oh

500
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,079
no

501
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,759
i don't have that app on my phone and

502
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:56,800
there's no way for me to do it

503
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:59,600
my husband who um you know

504
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:00,399
has a an older android phone sometimes

505
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,600
will put

506
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:05,359
apps on his phone and so you know i said

507
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,640
why don't you try to download that app

508
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:10,079
and we can use it

509
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:13,679
turns out his phone is too old

510
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:16,720
to use that app so we get there

511
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:18,319
and we realize that in fact because we

512
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,720
have old devices or because

513
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:22,240
of my ideological choice to not use

514
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:24,000
proprietary software

515
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,280
that we were going to have to wait in

516
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,760
these long lines

517
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:29,280
while other people like literally walk

518
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:31,600
to the front of the line

519
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:33,520
and i was thinking this camp this can't

520
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:36,480
be right and you know what

521
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:38,320
karen you're a free software activist

522
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:40,240
right you're an executive director

523
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:42,399
like you should say something about this

524
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:46,400
you're a karen talk to the manager

525
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:50,000
so so i i went to there's this uh

526
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:53,679
like uh uh customer service area

527
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,559
of um of disneyland where you can go and

528
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:56,720
talk to

529
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:58,000
um to to people who will help you the

530
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:01,120
the women that were there

531
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,160
for a striking similarity to the janet

532
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:05,360
character

533
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:08,160
in the good place um i am

534
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:09,120
pretty sure that she's based on these

535
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,679
disneyland

536
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,320
customer service representatives um they

537
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:16,160
were

538
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:18,159
so nice so helpful um impeccably dressed

539
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:19,200
in kind of a similar way with like tweed

540
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,720
vests and things

541
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,799
um i i can't remember exactly what they

542
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:24,820
were wearing but wouldn't disney have

543
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:26,720
the bad janet

544
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:29,840
[Laughter]

545
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:32,000
these these janets look like good janice

546
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:33,520
and so i went and i got worked up i i

547
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,799
was hesitant but i went over and talked

548
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:37,200
to them and i said

549
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:37,918
you know i explained the situation about

550
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,000
you know i

551
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:41,360
i you know it's always a good time to

552
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,799
talk about free software

553
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:46,799
so so i first lead with i i don't like

554
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:48,879
proprietary software here's why

555
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:50,400
i told them the story of my heart device

556
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:52,640
gave them the whole thing

557
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:54,320
and um and and they were you know they

558
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:57,440
were a little a little surprised

559
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:59,840
um and um and and then i explained

560
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,880
that my husband's phone was old and so

561
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,480
even though

562
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:04,480
we were willing to overlook these

563
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:08,000
ethical concerns to just get through

564
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:10,559
a nice family day we couldn't and

565
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,200
the janets were really surprised they

566
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:13,280
said

567
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:15,600
they had they no one had ever complained

568
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:18,879
to them personally about this before

569
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:21,039
um and i realized that it's because

570
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:22,480
if you don't have the money for a

571
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:25,440
current phone

572
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:26,400
and you've saved to go to disneyland and

573
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:29,280
you get there

574
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,880
and you realize that you don't have the

575
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,080
access that other people have it's

576
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:34,000
embarrassing

577
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:35,678
it's embarrassing to go and admit you

578
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,160
can't afford a new phone not everyone is

579
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:37,360
saying

580
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:39,760
it's about software freedom and

581
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:41,360
therefore i can go and talk to you

582
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,879
no one you know most people aren't not

583
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,799
most people aren't gonna

584
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:46,880
do that and they're gonna be a karen

585
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:49,039
right they're gonna they're gonna

586
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:50,480
sink back into themselves and um and

587
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:51,200
just wait on the lines and they and

588
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:54,160
their children

589
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,720
will wait longer just because they're

590
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,799
poorer

591
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:58,400
and it was this fascinating thing the

592
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:59,120
janets were great they did the right

593
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:02,240
thing they

594
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:04,080
gave me a new um they gave me

595
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:06,000
like a like this something that was like

596
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:08,399
a notice that was attached to my

597
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,400
paper ticket so that i could go on a

598
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,200
special line at a few of the rides and

599
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,360
skip them

600
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:15,280
so they had the right result in my case

601
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:18,559
but it was such an interesting

602
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:20,639
way of realizing that these issues

603
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:23,520
around proprietary software

604
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:24,159
are designed into every aspect of our

605
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,158
lives

606
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:28,240
and in places that you just don't think

607
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:31,120
about why on earth

608
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:32,640
would this be necessary to go go on

609
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:35,600
rides at disneyland

610
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:37,520
you know and the class issue about it

611
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:39,199
was really interesting especially when

612
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:41,440
for all of the things that disney does

613
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,960
wrong they really have thought about

614
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,240
issues of trying to make all of their

615
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:47,440
customers feel

616
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:49,039
um you know feel not feel bad about

617
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:51,360
about not being able to afford things

618
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:55,360
like if you go and order

619
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:58,320
um a food item at one of the food carts

620
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:59,678
you know unlike other places in the

621
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:01,280
united states where they'll say would

622
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:03,120
you like to supersize that or

623
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:05,120
would you also like this special cup or

624
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:06,879
would you also like this or that

625
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:08,399
when you order something like i'll just

626
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:10,400
have i'll have the popcorn

627
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:12,480
they just say great i'm going to give

628
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:14,320
you the this regular popcorn

629
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,679
and it that's very meaningful if you're

630
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:17,200
there with little kids because if you're

631
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:20,240
there with little kids and

632
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:22,559
someone says oh well there's this elsa

633
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:24,400
popcorn that costs five dollars more

634
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:25,760
the kids are going to say oh i want that

635
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:28,320
special fancy popcorn so

636
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:29,280
it's clear that disney has thought about

637
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,879
these issues

638
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:32,960
because they're very unified and all

639
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,840
like if you go and buy um any kind of

640
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,600
swag

641
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:38,480
but at the at the end of the day they

642
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:40,879
had not thought about this aspect of

643
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:42,799
this of their their digital technology

644
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:46,240
and these thoughtless decisions

645
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:48,960
are being are being woven into all kinds

646
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:51,280
of technology in all kinds of ways

647
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:52,559
yeah and while i heard all these groans

648
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:54,240
in the audience when disney was

649
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:57,200
mentioned uh there was a story

650
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,760
uh last year that the largest search on

651
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,120
the internet

652
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:01,679
even though it was only around for three

653
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:05,199
months of last year was disney plus

654
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:07,520
right so we're in a bubble here

655
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,320
as free software activists as people who

656
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:10,240
care about

657
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:11,840
free and open source software and most

658
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:13,360
of the people in the world are facing

659
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:17,039
these kinds of choices

660
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:18,639
on a regular basis and it is our job to

661
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:22,559
explain to them

662
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:24,320
why and how these choices

663
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:26,000
mix in with the issues of software

664
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:27,918
freedom how they're making choices about

665
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,000
software they're bad for their software

666
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:33,840
freedom bad for their data privacy

667
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:35,919
bad in a number of different ways so

668
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:37,360
we as activists of course are gonna

669
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:39,200
sometimes have to live in that real

670
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,600
world we've just given you two stories

671
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,960
of how

672
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:43,039
karen and i have lived in that real

673
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:44,400
world and i'm sure you all have many of

674
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:45,840
your own

675
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:47,679
one of the strategies that i talked

676
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:49,760
about briefly last year and i'll give a

677
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:51,919
little more detail on today

678
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:52,799
is this idea of just having that one

679
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:55,120
device

680
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:56,240
where you put all your proprietary

681
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,520
software this is an idea there's

682
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:59,039
actually somebody who's in the audience

683
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,520
right now who suggested this to me it's

684
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:01,440
like well

685
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:03,120
just get one device we get some android

686
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:05,520
tablet which is in fact what my

687
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:06,399
dad gave me as i talked about last year

688
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:09,679
uh on

689
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:12,080
unrequested by the way uh and

690
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:13,520
that particular device is where i've

691
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:15,520
slowly started putting all the

692
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:17,679
proprietary software like the

693
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:18,639
uh the grocery store apps i talked about

694
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:21,200
on there

695
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:22,640
now now the problem with this is in a

696
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,480
number of different directions

697
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:26,480
but one problem i want to identify that

698
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:28,640
i didn't mention in previous talks

699
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:30,880
is that in some sense this is kind of

700
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:33,039
the worst approach for your data privacy

701
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:34,320
because now i have the one place where

702
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:36,799
all the spying apps

703
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:38,960
are in my life which means they can all

704
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:41,600
talk to each other and i'm sure they all

705
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:43,760
are telling each other all about all my

706
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,559
habits all my things giving all my data

707
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:46,799
back to

708
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:49,039
all of the folks who do massive data

709
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:52,240
collection to market more things to me

710
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:55,200
and indeed even at my ip number level

711
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:56,559
the level of marketing accuracy has shot

712
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,880
up unbelievably

713
00:23:56,559 --> 00:24:00,799
simply because i have this one device so

714
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,679
even when i see ads on my fully free

715
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:03,440
software browser

716
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:05,039
notwithstanding proprietary javascript

717
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:07,120
of course it knows

718
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:09,360
because i've used the same ip number

719
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:11,360
that all the stuff that i've done

720
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:12,959
on these various proprietary things so i

721
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,520
actually think the proprietary dumping

722
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,360
ground

723
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:17,039
well it seems like it's a good option

724
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,719
it's like oh i just have this one little

725
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:20,240
boxed in sandbox where i allow

726
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,840
proprietary software

727
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:23,600
in some sense it's worse i'm actually

728
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:25,520
starting to think maybe having one

729
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,959
proprietary program on all different

730
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:29,918
free devices might be

731
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:31,440
a little better with regard to davis to

732
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:33,679
data privacy

733
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:35,120
yep and to avoid those apps is to pay

734
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:38,159
more right i mean so

735
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:40,000
i i when i choose to avoid them as i do

736
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:42,240
often it means that i have to pay more

737
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:45,279
and not everyone can afford to do that

738
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:47,120
yeah so there's been this

739
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:48,720
hypocrisy that we've talked about quite

740
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:52,000
a bit uh in our

741
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:53,600
in other venues with regard to how

742
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,039
free software advocacy was done

743
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:57,760
historically

744
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:59,279
i think this idea of telling people that

745
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,799
they should be pure telling people that

746
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:03,120
they should be ashamed if they're using

747
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:06,960
proprietary software

748
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:08,879
is something that is quite frankly toxic

749
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:10,720
i am certainly still willing to tell

750
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:12,080
people who write proprietary software

751
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:13,679
they're doing something wrong because

752
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,320
they're actively participating in the

753
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:16,640
production

754
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:18,559
of new things that are bad for people

755
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:19,360
but someone who's using proprietary

756
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:22,240
software

757
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:23,918
is facing a difficult moral choice and

758
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:25,760
we shouldn't tell them to stand there

759
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:27,360
and decide between two muffins neither

760
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,559
of which is really the best option

761
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:30,240
we should tell them they have to pick

762
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:31,600
one but really think about what the

763
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:33,919
implications are

764
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:35,279
yeah i mean last year uh here at fosdem

765
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:37,200
was the first time bradley and i

766
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:39,279
confessed that we were using

767
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,799
any you know any real amount of

768
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:42,320
proprietary software at all that was the

769
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:45,440
purpose of last year's talk

770
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:48,879
and um and the the outpouring

771
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:50,080
of um of of of confessions from people

772
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:54,159
in the audience

773
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:57,120
and um and the gratitude of people who

774
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:59,039
were living in shame because they care

775
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:01,760
so much about software freedom

776
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:03,200
but are relying on so much proprietary

777
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,240
software every day was really

778
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:07,600
overwhelming

779
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:09,120
i think a lot of people you know don't

780
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,719
understand these choices that we make

781
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:14,158
they're invisible just like

782
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:15,919
in a muffin you don't often know whether

783
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:17,520
you have you know what what the

784
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:18,000
ingredients are inside the muffin it's

785
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:21,039
the same

786
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,400
kind of issue with software freedom

787
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:25,600
i think people don't really think about

788
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:28,720
the ethics of their technology they just

789
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:30,399
see something really glossy and and know

790
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:33,600
what they have to use

791
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:35,039
but once you know it's it's so hard to

792
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:38,639
make those choices

793
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:41,520
and now that um that we've

794
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:43,520
uh now that we've admitted that we use

795
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:46,639
some proprietary software

796
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:48,720
i think it's been amazing to hear how

797
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:50,159
everyone else is also using proprietary

798
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:52,880
software and how

799
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:54,480
we have to just simply accept it and be

800
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:57,440
thoughtful about it

801
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:59,120
so if you take one thing away from this

802
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:02,080
talk

803
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:03,918
i would like to ask shaming people for

804
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:06,559
using proprietary software

805
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:07,039
should end here and it should end now

806
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:08,460
don't

807
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:14,158
do it anymore

808
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:16,000
[Applause]

809
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:18,159
and it's an inspiring and exciting thing

810
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,320
to say and it's such a relief

811
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:21,600
but it doesn't make us feel any better

812
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:24,639
it sucks

813
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:27,439
because we should still be talking about

814
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:27,919
proprietary software and we should never

815
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,840
stop

816
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:31,440
working towards using as much free and

817
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:33,600
open source software as we can

818
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:34,960
so instead we need to start educating

819
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:37,678
people respectfully

820
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:39,840
so as i said it's never a bad time to

821
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:42,399
talk about free software i spent about

822
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:43,918
15 minutes in uh talking to an

823
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:44,639
immigration official on my way into

824
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:47,520
belgium

825
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:48,320
um just about like what conference are

826
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:52,158
you going to

827
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:53,120
well it's all about software freedom and

828
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:54,559
so he was really

829
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:56,239
you know he hadn't really thought about

830
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:58,480
it and really heard it and there were so

831
00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:00,240
many of you coming through immigration

832
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:01,600
that that he was really excited to hear

833
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:04,000
what it was about and

834
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:05,199
i think people are are curious about it

835
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,600
they understand it

836
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:09,600
that there's something going on this has

837
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:11,840
changed over the last few years

838
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:14,000
we have had so many issues that have

839
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:15,520
been connected to software freedom

840
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,279
that are connected to issues around

841
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:18,720
ethics and tech that people

842
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:21,039
understand they should have a vague

843
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:23,520
distrust of the technology they rely on

844
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:25,919
so there are so many opportunities that

845
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:28,399
we never had before and so

846
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:29,440
we shouldn't be ashamed but that doesn't

847
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:32,799
mean we should in

848
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:34,559
any small way give up but don't feel

849
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:36,720
that you have a

850
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:38,720
constant moral obligation to do this in

851
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:40,559
a conscient system this is not a high

852
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:42,960
moral imperative to put it in

853
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:44,799
conscient terms do the best you can to

854
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:47,039
talk to people

855
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:48,559
karen is a person who's particularly

856
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:50,480
good at meeting people where they are

857
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:52,080
and is exuberant and able to talk to

858
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:53,679
people so she's able to do that

859
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:55,840
to be quite frank about it the only

860
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:57,760
thing i said to immigration was

861
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:58,879
please stamp on page 12 because i

862
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:00,640
already have a stamp there and i'm

863
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:02,880
trying to save pages

864
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:04,559
so you don't have to advocate at every

865
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:06,080
moment but look for them

866
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:08,559
and when you're comfortable when you

867
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:10,158
feel safe doing it when you feel able

868
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:11,520
to meet someone where they are and tell

869
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:12,399
them about why you care about free

870
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:15,440
software

871
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:17,279
do so but don't feel any shame or any

872
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:18,480
bad feelings about not being able to do

873
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:21,440
it as much as you would like

874
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:23,919
just keep working on it there's been a

875
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:27,440
lot of discussion about sustainability

876
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:30,480
how do we sustain this field

877
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:33,760
how do we pay maintainers how do we

878
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:36,399
avoid various disasters and

879
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:38,000
what i found is that often those

880
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:40,320
discussions

881
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,760
wind up being about how to sustain

882
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:44,879
for-profit interests

883
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:47,279
in open source

884
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:48,159
we need to talk about sustainability

885
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:50,640
from a

886
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:51,200
movement perspective we need to talk

887
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:54,399
about

888
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:56,320
how ideology fits with

889
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:57,439
making a future for us and our

890
00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:00,879
technology

891
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:03,600
the sustainability discussion cannot be

892
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:04,399
about how money flows around in this

893
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:07,199
space

894
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:08,399
while money is important it has to be

895
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:10,399
about how

896
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:11,678
can we make technology that we can

897
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:13,840
control in the long run

898
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:15,600
and how can we function as a community

899
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:19,279
how can we work with companies

900
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:21,039
so that they they do things on our terms

901
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:22,480
so that we don't have a distrust of our

902
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:24,320
basic devices

903
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:25,760
the approach to sustainability which has

904
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:28,000
just become such a huge

905
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:29,760
buzzword and i often say in talks i

906
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,520
thought that sustainability and free

907
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:33,279
software was going to be about

908
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:35,440
connecting up to other ethical issues

909
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:37,039
for example how to help prevent climate

910
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:38,480
change with free software because that's

911
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:40,158
usually what i think of when i think of

912
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:42,000
sustainability

913
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:44,080
karen is quite right that most of the

914
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,039
discussion has been about how do we fund

915
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:46,639
developers

916
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:48,480
at the same level to which silicon

917
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:49,360
valley is finding proprietary software

918
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,799
developers

919
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:52,320
we're going to talk in a minute about

920
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:54,960
some of the ways that we're looking at

921
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:57,039
ways to fund developers which we agree

922
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:58,640
is incredibly important but

923
00:30:57,039 --> 00:31:00,640
sustainability if we're going to talk

924
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:02,080
about in terms of how to keep our foss

925
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:04,880
communities going

926
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:06,639
has to be holistically approached we

927
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:08,480
have to think about how do we sustain

928
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:10,960
our moral

929
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:12,159
bandwidth how do we sustain ourselves

930
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,760
from becoming burned out

931
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:15,840
how do we continue to care about our

932
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:18,000
cause while figuring out what

933
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:19,439
trade-offs we have to make every day we

934
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,720
have to look at it from all those

935
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:23,039
different angles

936
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:26,159
our technology is not sustainable unless

937
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:26,158
it lets us live in freedom

938
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:30,720
the fact of the matter is i think the

939
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:33,440
biggest sustainability problem

940
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:34,080
is that not that we're not writing

941
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:36,960
enough

942
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:38,240
foss tons is getting written every day

943
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:41,360
more foss is being written

944
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:41,840
has ever existed in history however i

945
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:44,399
feel

946
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:45,439
that most for profit companies from my

947
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:47,279
point of view

948
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:50,159
are basically writing the wrong free

949
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:52,720
software the priorities are in the wrong

950
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:55,200
places they're focused on software that

951
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:56,640
is going to increase their ability to

952
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,960
move forward in their businesses they're

953
00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:00,000
focused on software that they can use as

954
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:03,360
a component or as

955
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:05,360
a base system open core style for some

956
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:06,080
larger proprietary system that they're

957
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,840
creating

958
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:09,600
well that software is good and it's good

959
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:11,199
that we make constant inroads it's

960
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:13,439
very good that linux has won on the

961
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:15,200
server market it's very good that

962
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:16,640
people have at least some base software

963
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,919
freedom with regard to their base

964
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:19,679
operating systems

965
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:21,200
there is still lots of stuff being

966
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:24,240
written that

967
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:27,360
is not the thing that people face most

968
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:29,279
in their daily lives trying to uh

969
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:31,678
deal with the proprietary software they

970
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:34,080
have to use in some weird sense

971
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:34,880
because of the corporate interest in

972
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:36,559
foss

973
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:38,640
companies have a lot more software

974
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:41,918
freedom than individuals do

975
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:43,440
each day yes and i think it's not

976
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:45,600
terribly surprising that

977
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:46,960
um that companies have jumped on board

978
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,719
this jumped on

979
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:50,559
the sustainability discussion and have

980
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:52,799
pushed forward these questions about

981
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:56,879
the flow of money and less about how do

982
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:59,918
we create technology that we can rely on

983
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:02,640
it's not a huge spoiler to

984
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:04,320
say about it's a to me tiny spoiler to

985
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,960
say about the good place and please if

986
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:07,039
you

987
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:09,679
come up to talk to us after this i have

988
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:11,679
not seen the end

989
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:15,360
but it's not a huge spoiler to say that

990
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:18,000
the characters in the good place

991
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:21,519
get better over time as they know each

992
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,519
other and as they work together

993
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:25,360
one of the things that struck us after

994
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:26,240
our talk last year when we came and we

995
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:28,000
confessed to you

996
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:30,240
all of the things that all of the

997
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:33,600
proprietary software that we use

998
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:35,840
um that together we can

999
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:37,360
we can we can support each other it was

1000
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:38,879
it was one of the most surprising things

1001
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:42,559
to see how unifying

1002
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:44,320
it was amongst people who are all so

1003
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:45,918
rot about all of the proprietary

1004
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:46,158
software that they're using when they

1005
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:50,240
are

1006
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:51,600
software freedom activists yeah and i

1007
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:54,559
feel that that's the most important

1008
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:56,559
thing i got involved in free software

1009
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:58,240
because there were communities people

1010
00:33:56,559 --> 00:34:00,320
doing things together there were people

1011
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:02,080
that i respected and became my friends

1012
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:03,600
that i worked together with

1013
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:05,199
i wouldn't be able to do the work that i

1014
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:06,399
do as a free software activist if i

1015
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,919
didn't have

1016
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:09,440
folks like karen who was not only my

1017
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:11,280
colleague but a personal friend

1018
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:13,119
whom we stand together and work together

1019
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:14,800
and support each other in doing this

1020
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:16,879
and i think as a larger community we

1021
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:20,320
have to do that for each other

1022
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:21,839
and talk to each other and be willing to

1023
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:24,079
admit to each other where we're

1024
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:26,320
struggling with how to make

1025
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:28,159
our work sustainable how to continue our

1026
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:29,280
projects it's okay to say to somebody

1027
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:31,599
i'm a maintainer

1028
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:33,520
and i don't know how to do it anymore

1029
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:34,720
rather than run to some company quickly

1030
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:35,759
and say give me a bunch of money because

1031
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:36,480
i'm a maintainer don't know how to do

1032
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:38,399
anymore

1033
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:40,159
tell your friends first in the project

1034
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:42,480
try to figure out how to

1035
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:44,000
work together to interact with those

1036
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,839
entities one of the things that's

1037
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,918
happened with

1038
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:49,119
free software funding is companies have

1039
00:34:47,918 --> 00:34:51,040
discovered that

1040
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:52,320
hiring a maintainer bringing them inside

1041
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:53,599
and kind of getting control of their

1042
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:56,720
workflow

1043
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:58,560
has become a method for controlling and

1044
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:59,279
changing the direction of free software

1045
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,960
projects

1046
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:03,200
your colleagues and your peers are the

1047
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:04,560
people that can support you best

1048
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:06,640
and this is the only way we're going to

1049
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:08,400
write those alternatives right like

1050
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:09,839
i i applaud the sustainability

1051
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:11,599
discussion overall because it's

1052
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:12,560
important that people be able to create

1053
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:14,560
livelihoods and

1054
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:16,400
i didn't mean to sound like there was um

1055
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:17,839
you know there's no value in that

1056
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:19,200
but we have to think big picture and

1057
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:20,240
we're never going to solve those big

1058
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,919
problems unless we

1059
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:24,479
really band together and work hard

1060
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:26,720
because we're already behind

1061
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:28,160
so we keep saying well it's not about

1062
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:30,399
money but we know that

1063
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:31,839
funding your work funding free software

1064
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:34,160
work is essential

1065
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:36,078
like people need to get salaries that's

1066
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,720
been the debate in the free software

1067
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:38,480
world the

1068
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:40,480
obsession with free software business

1069
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:42,320
models we heard frank talk about that

1070
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:44,079
in a previous session which folks on the

1071
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:47,280
video can find in the foster video

1072
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:48,560
archives we believe deeply in funding

1073
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:51,040
free software

1074
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:52,240
we think that there are careful ways you

1075
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:54,079
have to go about it we

1076
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:56,078
do a tremendous amount of funding free

1077
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:59,119
software developers through conservancy

1078
00:35:56,079 --> 00:35:59,839
and the reason that karen and i put so

1079
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:02,560
much work

1080
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:04,799
into making conservancy successful was

1081
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:07,040
so that there could be a place

1082
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:09,200
that the important free software

1083
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:10,800
projects that are focused on individual

1084
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:12,160
user rights and freedoms and to make

1085
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:14,480
users lives better

1086
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:16,078
could receive funding in a way rather

1087
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:17,920
than through a for-profit company who

1088
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:20,000
ultimately has to chase

1089
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:21,200
making their company profitable and

1090
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,599
successful

1091
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:24,640
we have to survive but we don't have to

1092
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:28,079
make a profit

1093
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:30,160
we are required in fact by the usa trial

1094
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:32,240
charity regulators where we're based to

1095
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:33,279
act in the public good and to fund work

1096
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:35,359
in the public good

1097
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:37,520
so we're able to fund developers in a

1098
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:38,799
way that we tell them go out and do

1099
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:40,400
what's right for the project

1100
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:42,240
it all has to be free software that's

1101
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:44,240
our rule that's the our mission

1102
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:45,680
but do it in a way that's making

1103
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:47,439
people's lives better that's helping

1104
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:49,520
people that's the accountability we want

1105
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:51,440
from the developers we fund

1106
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:53,359
yeah it's a it's a it's a question of

1107
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:54,960
control and when you have

1108
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:57,279
this happening in a charitable

1109
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:58,800
environment it makes it much easier to

1110
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:00,960
work on the issues that matter

1111
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:04,240
and i'm proud to say that we have about

1112
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:06,640
something like we pay around 120

1113
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:07,439
contractors to work on free software

1114
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:10,240
every year

1115
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:12,320
um yeah in fact i'm going to give two

1116
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:14,160
brief examples of projects that we've

1117
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:15,839
worked with so the inkscape project

1118
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:17,359
which is one of the oldest free software

1119
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:20,400
projects we have

1120
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:23,119
they have been amazingly uh dogged in

1121
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:26,320
their determination to replace

1122
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:27,920
proprietary graphics uh proprietary

1123
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:30,800
graphic design programs

1124
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:31,680
and to to be frank about it that space

1125
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:33,920
has gotten even

1126
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:35,440
more horrible with regard to how

1127
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:36,640
licensing works

1128
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:38,560
many of you may not know because you

1129
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:41,279
don't use because like us you don't use

1130
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:43,040
proprietary software most of the time

1131
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:44,720
you may not realize that the adobe

1132
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:47,040
illustrator is a

1133
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:48,240
business model changed from being you

1134
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:49,920
could buy the software

1135
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:51,759
the old school proprietary model you

1136
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:53,280
bought a box set of the copy

1137
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:54,720
and you paid a certain amount for it you

1138
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:56,079
could install it and run it for as long

1139
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:58,959
as you want

1140
00:37:56,079 --> 00:38:00,079
they ended that years ago all the

1141
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:02,480
current versions

1142
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:03,920
are subscription models if your device

1143
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:05,760
doesn't connect to the internet once a

1144
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:07,280
month to confirm that you've renewed

1145
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:09,119
your monthly subscription to adobe

1146
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:11,440
illustrator it stops working

1147
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:12,480
until you do there are people out there

1148
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:14,640
that are having that

1149
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:15,760
moral choice between two muffins they're

1150
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:18,319
looking and saying

1151
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:19,280
well i have my old copy of adobe

1152
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:21,760
illustrator

1153
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:23,839
from years and years ago that has some

1154
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:26,000
bugs and problems but at least it is the

1155
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:28,240
one that i don't have to pay monthly for

1156
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:30,640
or i can use inkscape which is great but

1157
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:32,720
doesn't have all those features yet

1158
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:34,319
so we're trying to make inkscape the

1159
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:35,200
easy choice we're trying to make it easy

1160
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:37,040
to say

1161
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:39,118
we can use inkscape and it has all the

1162
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:41,119
features that illustrator does and

1163
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:42,320
not only is it freezing price so we

1164
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:43,359
don't have to pay these monthly

1165
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:45,440
subscription fees

1166
00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:47,040
but it's freezing freedom to assure that

1167
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:48,720
you're not going to be exploited by a

1168
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:51,040
proprietary software company in the way

1169
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:53,598
that adobe is exploiting its users

1170
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:54,560
and the impact is amazing because um you

1171
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:56,480
know we'll get

1172
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:57,680
tons of tiny donations from people who

1173
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:59,680
are so grateful to use

1174
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:00,879
inkscape you know 10 donations from

1175
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:03,919
people saying

1176
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:04,960
this changed my life um similarly so to

1177
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:06,880
give an example

1178
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:08,640
with weddingscape we do we fund all of

1179
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:10,079
our hack fests and send people around

1180
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:12,480
the world to do the hack fest in the

1181
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:14,560
case of this other project godot

1182
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:16,000
which has a booth here that you can go

1183
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:17,520
and see them and they also have i

1184
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,119
believe karen they have a conference uh

1185
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:20,880
coming up soon yeah good joke on it's

1186
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:23,359
it's right after fosdem

1187
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:25,040
and we are funding i think four

1188
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:26,000
different contractors some of them

1189
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:28,160
full-time

1190
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,520
on a monthly basis to work on godot and

1191
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:31,520
it's disrupting

1192
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:33,200
how game engines how game software is

1193
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:34,640
being built because there's a fully free

1194
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:36,799
software game engine now

1195
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:38,319
that people are using uh and it's often

1196
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:40,320
the toast of some of the

1197
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:42,160
otherwise proprietary game development

1198
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,720
conferences that they go to to talk

1199
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:44,960
about

1200
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:46,480
because it's reducing the barrier to

1201
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:48,640
entry into the gaming world

1202
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:50,800
in the same way that the lots of

1203
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:52,480
different technologies for cloud and so

1204
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:53,599
forth reduce the barrier of entry into

1205
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:56,320
those places

1206
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:58,720
so we believe chasing these new

1207
00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:00,640
locations where free software is

1208
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:01,919
by far not the default where free

1209
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:04,319
software is rare

1210
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:06,240
is absolutely essential and putting

1211
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:07,200
funding there and funding the developers

1212
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:09,598
in a charitable way

1213
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:10,319
is essential to getting towards software

1214
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:12,160
freedom

1215
00:40:10,319 --> 00:40:14,319
funding contractors isn't the only way

1216
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:17,279
that we um that we work on this

1217
00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:18,800
can you move the next slide yeah so our

1218
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:22,000
our enforcement work is a really

1219
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:24,960
important component of this um it's

1220
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:26,000
amazing that so many people buy so many

1221
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:29,280
devices

1222
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:32,240
where they should have the right to

1223
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:34,160
see the source to to receive the source

1224
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:35,839
code on those devices in such a way that

1225
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,560
they could replace the software on those

1226
00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:40,560
devices

1227
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:43,279
but because violations on the gpl are

1228
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:44,960
so common um it means that that's almost

1229
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:48,400
never the case

1230
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:49,520
so these rights are are baked in and

1231
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:51,760
they travel

1232
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:52,720
with this software and yet they are

1233
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:55,440
being included

1234
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:56,078
in surveillance devices that people are

1235
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:58,240
using

1236
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:59,520
in all way all kinds of ways in their

1237
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:02,959
lives and so

1238
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:06,000
um being able to use gpl enforcement

1239
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:08,160
as a lever to to help us

1240
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,119
replace those devices with ones that we

1241
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:12,078
can

1242
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:13,119
we we can rely on is is important and so

1243
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:16,000
that's one of the things that

1244
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:17,119
uh that we focus on what keeps me going

1245
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,960
every day in this work

1246
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:20,240
is quite frankly the fact that linux

1247
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:23,520
changed my life

1248
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:25,759
i downloaded linux in 1992 and installed

1249
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:28,480
it on the laptop that i just bought

1250
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:29,119
and discovered software freedom and

1251
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:32,480
linux

1252
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:34,640
is the most important

1253
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:35,920
free software project ever written from

1254
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:39,040
my point of view

1255
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:41,200
and it breaks my heart to see the next

1256
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:42,960
generation of linux users

1257
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:44,720
not able to do what i was able to do

1258
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:45,760
because when i downloaded linux it was

1259
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:47,680
under the gpl

1260
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:49,520
and fully compliant i got a bunch of

1261
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:51,598
floppies i got all the source code i was

1262
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:53,599
allowed to modify and improve it

1263
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:55,520
most people who get linux today can't do

1264
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:57,520
that because quite frankly

1265
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:58,800
most devices running linux today are

1266
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:00,560
violating the gpl

1267
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:03,200
and you don't have the source code and

1268
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:04,880
the ability to modify and reinstall it

1269
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:06,560
and that's why we work on this because

1270
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:08,160
we believe linux is important

1271
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:10,400
for the future of software freedom and

1272
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:12,000
for all software users everywhere

1273
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:13,440
we have a lot of exciting announcements

1274
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,359
coming soon and

1275
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:16,560
um and we'll keep you posted yeah oh

1276
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:17,680
sorry no we haven't

1277
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:20,400
we're both trying to switch up we're

1278
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:22,160
fighting now on slides tomorrow we're

1279
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:24,400
gonna have a lot of conversations about

1280
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:25,520
copyleft and how it impacts us and our

1281
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:27,760
sustainability

1282
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:30,240
um it's uh you can register at

1283
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:32,000
copyleft.conf it's here in brussels so

1284
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:34,000
um yeah please i want to join you just

1285
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,560
go back for a moment to this point to

1286
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,319
say

1287
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:37,599
that we're we're looking this year about

1288
00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:40,000
how to marry these two

1289
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:41,440
approaches we we believe that gpl

1290
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,960
enforcement is essential for

1291
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:44,319
enforcement for linux is essential to

1292
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:45,440
software freedom we believe funding

1293
00:42:44,319 --> 00:42:46,640
software development is

1294
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:48,160
essential and we're going to look at

1295
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:50,480
some projects of how to marry the two

1296
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:50,480
together

1297
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:56,400
we have a podcast faith.us

1298
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:00,319
and thank you so much for listening to

1299
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:01,839
us and for supporting conservancy and

1300
00:43:00,319 --> 00:43:05,520
our work and for all of the work and

1301
00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:05,520
software freedom that you individually

1302
00:43:10,839 --> 00:43:13,839
do

1303
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:17,599
so so i want to remind everyone what

1304
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:19,760
karen said at the beginning if you watch

1305
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:22,480
lots of old fosdem videos you you will

1306
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:24,319
wonder why the speaker in jansen

1307
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:26,160
that never answers the question that was

1308
00:43:24,319 --> 00:43:27,599
asked you're going to ask a question we

1309
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:28,319
probably won't be able to hear it up

1310
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:30,400
here

1311
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:33,839
give it a try but if we answer the wrong

1312
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:33,839
thing don't please understand

1313
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:42,319
and you can ask us anything about

1314
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:45,280
conservancy about enforcement

1315
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:45,279
about outreachy

1316
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:55,839
i scared everybody off by saying we

1317
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:55,839
wouldn't be able to hear them

1318
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:06,799
hi i had a big quick question about you

1319
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:07,279
mentioned using propriety software like

1320
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:09,920
apps

1321
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:10,319
on phones and things like that something

1322
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:11,839
that

1323
00:44:10,319 --> 00:44:14,160
friends and colleagues have mentioned to

1324
00:44:11,839 --> 00:44:15,040
me recently is sort of taking a more

1325
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:18,560
active approach

1326
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:19,359
to um sort of protesting having to use

1327
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:23,839
them

1328
00:44:19,359 --> 00:44:23,839
by deliberately feeding bad information

1329
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:30,880
feeding bad information what's your

1330
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:30,880
moral take on that

1331
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:34,319
i mean i i would never encourage anyone

1332
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:36,800
to

1333
00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:38,000
violate something that they agreed to so

1334
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:39,760
if you've agreed to terms of condition

1335
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,839
that say you won't do that you

1336
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:43,599
should not violate it but one thing i do

1337
00:44:41,839 --> 00:44:45,119
encourage you is to check the terms and

1338
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:47,520
conditions of what you're agreeing to

1339
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:49,359
to find out if that's in there i noticed

1340
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:51,680
that a lot of people it's just become so

1341
00:44:49,359 --> 00:44:54,640
common to click yes all the time the

1342
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:56,799
millions of pages of legal mumbo-jumbo

1343
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:59,118
that everybody's had to agree to

1344
00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:00,480
is very disheartening so read those

1345
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:01,920
agreements at least and see if you're

1346
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:03,359
see if it speaks to that issue if it

1347
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:04,000
does not speak to that issue i think

1348
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:06,880
it's absolutely

1349
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:08,800
fine to feed incorrect data into system

1350
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:11,440
that allows you to do it

1351
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:11,920
also always exercise your offers for

1352
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:14,319
source

1353
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:15,839
if you get a product that says there is

1354
00:45:14,319 --> 00:45:17,599
gpl code in here or

1355
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:20,480
your this has open source and it has

1356
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:23,119
rights always ask for the source code

1357
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:24,240
always ask and if you can check that it

1358
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:26,720
what they sent you is

1359
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:26,720
is right

1360
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:32,319
so there's questions over here okay yep

1361
00:45:30,839 --> 00:45:35,520
um

1362
00:45:32,319 --> 00:45:38,880
two questions first question um if

1363
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:41,280
um if for example there is a uh voting

1364
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:43,280
or referendum app in us in a town in

1365
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:43,839
germany already out and it's closed

1366
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:47,280
source

1367
00:45:43,839 --> 00:45:50,078
um what could uh could could the

1368
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:50,720
uh s soft software freedom conservancy

1369
00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:54,000
kind of

1370
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:56,240
help in any way um to um

1371
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,599
get that uh get get the weaknesses

1372
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:59,839
exposed and the

1373
00:45:57,599 --> 00:46:02,560
uh the app replaced by open source

1374
00:45:59,839 --> 00:46:05,359
software or free software actually

1375
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:07,040
if not what would be an alternate a

1376
00:46:05,359 --> 00:46:10,799
european alternative

1377
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:12,640
to help there that's the first question

1378
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:14,640
what do we do the question was what do

1379
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:15,520
we do for times when there's

1380
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:16,960
implementation

1381
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:18,880
of proprietary software where there

1382
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:22,079
really should be free software like in

1383
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:23,680
voting um apps as their voting software

1384
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:25,599
as there has been recently what can

1385
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:28,879
software freedom conservancy do

1386
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:30,640
to help with the situation yeah um so

1387
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:32,400
we we try to do a number of things

1388
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:35,118
public education is one of those

1389
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:35,680
uh the major things that we try to do i

1390
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:38,240
am

1391
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:40,319
so frustrated because i thought when i

1392
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:42,479
started in this field

1393
00:46:40,319 --> 00:46:44,000
longer ago than i would like care to say

1394
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:46,960
i thought it was just a matter

1395
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,599
of waking people up to this problem i

1396
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:50,079
thought

1397
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:50,800
so naively that i would just say look at

1398
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:52,960
the fact

1399
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:54,560
look at this look at the situation and

1400
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:55,280
that as soon as we would have one

1401
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:58,319
failure

1402
00:46:55,280 --> 00:47:00,720
everyone would realize oh actually if we

1403
00:46:58,319 --> 00:47:02,720
had access to our source code over time

1404
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:04,480
we'll have the able to make the fixes

1405
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:05,520
that we need and we'll be so much better

1406
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:07,839
off that we shouldn't

1407
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:09,520
entrust single corporations blah blah

1408
00:47:07,839 --> 00:47:11,520
blah blah blah blah

1409
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:13,359
and i i think i think another to your

1410
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:16,480
point another important thing to

1411
00:47:13,359 --> 00:47:18,000
look to is uh is how to get things done

1412
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:19,440
with particularly like with voting where

1413
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,160
you're interacting with the government

1414
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:22,960
uh by

1415
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:24,000
doing it without using the software so

1416
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:26,079
an example that we use

1417
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:27,440
we file our paperwork with the united

1418
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:29,440
states on paper

1419
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:30,480
which is more work for us but we choose

1420
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:32,000
to do that work rather than

1421
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:32,480
electronically file because there's no

1422
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,559
way

1423
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:35,920
to electronically file in the us without

1424
00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:39,119
proprietary software

1425
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:40,960
so as a individual standing up and

1426
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:42,559
saying complaining to the voting

1427
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:44,079
authorities in your country that

1428
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:45,359
i don't want to use this proprietary

1429
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:46,240
software app to vote you should give me

1430
00:47:45,359 --> 00:47:47,598
an alternative

1431
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:49,118
and collective action is really

1432
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:50,640
important yeah and the only way you'll

1433
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:51,680
get people to change in an individual

1434
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:53,279
way is when you

1435
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:55,040
get personally involved in their

1436
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:56,480
community you get you get as involved in

1437
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:57,040
the community as you can and you build

1438
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:58,640
trust

1439
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:00,240
and we have to be honest that a lot of

1440
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:00,640
our solutions are not as are you know or

1441
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:02,879
not

1442
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:04,400
at the point as proprietary software and

1443
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:06,800
so you know

1444
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:07,680
i i find that for example going into

1445
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:09,680
schools

1446
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:12,000
you know you have to have suggestions

1447
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:14,000
for things to do differently

1448
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,280
uh so you would go on the record to uh

1449
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,520
recommend the uh

1450
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:18,640
the citizens of tubing and to vote not

1451
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:21,680
by app but by

1452
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:24,000
by paper go for it

1453
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:25,279
okay uh second question there's a this

1454
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,200
is a complex problem

1455
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:29,920
because it's distributed if it's up

1456
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:31,359
close and personal like a pacemaker or

1457
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:33,839
defibrillator

1458
00:48:31,359 --> 00:48:35,200
um there are no kneeling benches here

1459
00:48:33,839 --> 00:48:37,200
this is not the catholic um

1460
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:38,799
university but um how could you help

1461
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:42,720
with that um

1462
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:46,880
uh trying to get a um a defibrillator

1463
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:49,759
um built uh by just bypassing the entire

1464
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:50,800
um the entire software stack and doing

1465
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:53,599
it in hardware

1466
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:55,200
okay this is a loaded question um and so

1467
00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:56,960
we'll move on to another question

1468
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:59,118
this the medical device space is fraught

1469
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:01,200
with difficulties and there are a number

1470
00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:03,359
of initiatives to now

1471
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:04,399
that are now working on medical devices

1472
00:49:03,359 --> 00:49:06,558
with with

1473
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:07,920
free and open source software which is a

1474
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:09,760
a great move

1475
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:11,680
yeah and i think taking the smaller

1476
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:12,480
steps like a lot of times you can't jump

1477
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:14,879
right to the

1478
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:16,720
most complicated and you know inside

1479
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:19,119
body embedded medical device

1480
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:20,879
there are people on more peripheral

1481
00:49:19,119 --> 00:49:22,319
medical devices where the regulations

1482
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:23,760
are a little more lacks

1483
00:49:22,319 --> 00:49:26,079
there's a community of free software

1484
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:28,640
developers who work on cpap

1485
00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:29,920
machine firmware for example so those

1486
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:31,279
are places where you can look to get

1487
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:33,440
involved with those communities and

1488
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:34,640
in my observing of those communities a

1489
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:36,480
lot of them are not

1490
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:38,720
very well versed in the traditional

1491
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:40,160
issues like free software licensing that

1492
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:42,319
community i just mentioned had a

1493
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:44,480
huge complicated licensing argument

1494
00:49:42,319 --> 00:49:46,079
recently and i was really hoping someone

1495
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:47,680
who had more knowledge about that would

1496
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:49,280
get involved to help them

1497
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:50,720
through those issues there's lots of

1498
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:51,839
places where people are beginning to

1499
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:53,279
write free software

1500
00:49:51,839 --> 00:49:55,279
that didn't traditionally write it and

1501
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:56,640
they don't know the history and how

1502
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:58,240
things work in our community there's

1503
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:59,839
lots of opportunities to join

1504
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:01,520
those communities and help even in the

1505
00:49:59,839 --> 00:50:03,440
open aps community where it is

1506
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:04,960
the the diabetes community where it's

1507
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:06,480
very regulated there's a lot of

1508
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:07,839
opportunity the only problem is that the

1509
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:10,160
medical device companies

1510
00:50:07,839 --> 00:50:11,599
are are wisening up because they see

1511
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:12,240
that people are getting a better result

1512
00:50:11,599 --> 00:50:14,240
with their

1513
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:15,759
own technology and their own software

1514
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:18,000
and so they're introducing some of the

1515
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:20,400
features that cause that to begin with

1516
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:21,200
okay where's the next this is the last

1517
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:24,400
question

1518
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:26,640
thanks hey i've just been to a workshop

1519
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:29,280
yesterday and it was about the open

1520
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:29,839
source observatory from the european

1521
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:31,680
commission

1522
00:50:29,839 --> 00:50:33,520
i don't know if you have heard of it

1523
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:36,879
they are looking for feedbacks

1524
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:38,400
about how to build guidelines for open

1525
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:40,240
source communities

1526
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:41,680
in the public sector and i believe that

1527
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:44,479
you guys have a lot of

1528
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:45,279
nice ideas that they should listen to

1529
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:48,800
have you linked

1530
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:49,119
to them um i heard some of that but not

1531
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:50,960
who

1532
00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:52,640
ran the workshop we'd be glad to talk to

1533
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:53,119
you after to get linked up with whoever

1534
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:54,480
it is

1535
00:50:53,119 --> 00:50:56,880
but we didn't hear you because of the

1536
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:58,160
audio so yes we couldn't hear exactly

1537
00:50:56,880 --> 00:51:00,160
what you said but there are a number of

1538
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:02,720
initiatives to create policies

1539
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:04,399
uh and we're happy to participate in any

1540
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:06,000
and all of them it's tough because

1541
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:07,440
there are so many and it's hard to know

1542
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,920
which ones will result

1543
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:11,520
in um you know in the policies that

1544
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:13,040
actually move forward but

1545
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:14,800
we have to we have to participate in

1546
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:15,119
every this is where you all come in

1547
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:17,280
where

1548
00:51:15,119 --> 00:51:18,319
we we can't we're a tiny organization at

1549
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:20,400
conservancy

1550
00:51:18,319 --> 00:51:21,920

1552
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:24,800
fiscal sponsorship we do

1553
00:51:23,359 --> 00:51:26,640
we're trying to do contract patch where

1554
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:28,000
we help people renegotiate their

1555
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:30,078
employment agreements with some

1556
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:31,440
collective power you know where we do

1557
00:51:30,079 --> 00:51:33,839
gpl enforcement

1558
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:35,119
so we need volunteers we need people to

1559
00:51:33,839 --> 00:51:37,119
get involved and we need to do so in a

1560
00:51:35,119 --> 00:51:38,800
coordinated way

1561
00:51:37,119 --> 00:51:40,800
i just point your attention on that

1562
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:41,440
