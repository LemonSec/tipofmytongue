1
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:08,080
good afternoon everyone

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:09,840
i'm here to tell you about a personal

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,920
project that i built over the past few

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,879
months which is essentially

5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:16,480
my own smart classes now most of this

6
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,080
talk will be based from the point of

7
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,560
view from a software developer because

8
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,198
that's

9
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,720
in general what i am but what i also

10
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:23,359
want to show you is that i was capable

11
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,599
of

12
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:26,560
building this using simple hardware

13
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:30,000
that's available

14
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:31,038
right off the shelf well first off i

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,040
just want a very

16
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:34,079
very quick uh introduction as to what

17
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:36,719
smart glasses are

18
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,079
now the most well-known ones are the

19
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,399
google glass

20
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:42,320
these are essentially just glasses which

21
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:44,879
essentially act as a small

22
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,399
display right here which can show you a

23
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:47,519
heads-up display which

24
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:50,399
might give you something that looks a

25
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,960
little bit like this a very quick show

26
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:53,520
of hands

27
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:56,160
who here has ever tried uh smart glasses

28
00:00:53,520 --> 00:01:00,480
something like a google glass

29
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:02,480
just a couple of hands yeah right um

30
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,839
uh that for me the first time when i got

31
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,518
into uh

32
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,360
smart glasses was when i was working for

33
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,840
a small startup company in holland

34
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:11,040
called

35
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:14,479
gem vision they offer a solution

36
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:16,240
where remote workers are able to uh

37
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:17,520
showcase what they're seeing to people

38
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,199
at the headquarters and then from the

39
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,000
headquarters they're capable of

40
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,439
uh communicating with uh with the remote

41
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,360
worker and give them instructions on

42
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:27,279
what to do

43
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,880
and something is crashing of course i'm

44
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:32,000
sorry let me just

45
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:34,960
very quickly see if i can get this to

46
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,240
work again yeah there we go um so

47
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,880
essentially when you're wearing smart

48
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,360
glasses

49
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:41,520
it looks a little bit like this you can

50
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,360
just look around and you have a small

51
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,798
headshot display here in the upper right

52
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,399
or below uh

53
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:47,840
now the first thing that you may think

54
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:50,159
is that this is something that will get

55
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,840
annoying really quick and that the

56
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,200
display itself will be in the way all

57
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,040
the time but the fact of the matter is

58
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,640
is that it's just a little bit outside

59
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,560
of your peripheral vision

60
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,079
so for me it's very easy to just look

61
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,799
past the screen and then whenever i want

62
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:02,479
to look up

63
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:03,920
any information i just in this case you

64
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:06,240
have to look down

65
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,119
and get the information that i need so

66
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,799
what they

67
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:14,480
were working on at gm vision is uh

68
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:17,280
well uh out there um

69
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,280
it's informa uh

70
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,879
all right i'm just gonna try to do this

71
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,840
as quickly as possible or just up

72
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:24,480
back and forth um so it's again vision

73
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,640
when people

74
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,879
were were wearing the glasses their

75
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:31,440
cameras were being streamed to an

76
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:32,239
another web application using webrtc and

77
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,840
so then via

78
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:35,360
microphone someone at the headquarters

79
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,160
could give them instructions on what to

80
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,840
do

81
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:41,280
or they could draw in the feed itself so

82
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,319
for example to give them instructions

83
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,519
like in this case

84
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:47,920
look at this television over here

85
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:50,640
the smart glasses that they were using

86
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:53,200
were called the fusix m300s

87
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,399
which runs on android and uh personally

88
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,000
i didn't do any work on the smart

89
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,200
glasses themselves i only worked on the

90
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,879
web application

91
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,720
but i really wanted to give this a try

92
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:02,000
because in my opinion i think smart

93
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,640
glasses are going to be a thing of the

94
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,640
future

95
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:07,760
not in this form but once they get a

96
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:10,000
little bit more like normal glasses

97
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:11,760
people will want to use them and because

98
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,200
these glasses were working on android i

99
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,200
was hoping that i could build something

100
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:18,000
using uh cordova

101
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,440
now unfortunately i wasn't allowed to uh

102
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,360
the smart glasses that they had over

103
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:24,159
there were reserved for their clients

104
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,760
so they uh really just didn't want me

105
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:27,519
prototyping or playing around with them

106
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,879
because in case they would break

107
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:30,239
well that would basically mean that it

108
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:31,679
would cost a lot of money for the

109
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,280
company and for a startup that's the

110
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,440
last thing you would want

111
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,799
and i would admit this kind of bumped me

112
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,400
out a bit because i just really wanted

113
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,159
to play around with this but

114
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,720
if i wanted to have my own smart glasses

115
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:44,399
i would have to pay at least 1 000 euros

116
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,560
which for me is just a little bit too

117
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,760
much to pay for um

118
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,599
well for something that i just want to

119
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,599
prototype with

120
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:53,439
but then last year i suddenly started

121
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:55,760
thinking i was wondering

122
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:57,439
could i build something like this myself

123
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,319
so i essentially just decided you know

124
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:00,480
what screw it

125
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:01,920
i am going to do it myself and for this

126
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:04,959
i essentially needed three

127
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:06,559
particular pieces of hardware now the

128
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:09,519
recipe that i have for it the first one

129
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:11,680
is you want to feel fine now the

130
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:12,640
viewfinder is the heads-up display that

131
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,120
i'm wearing here

132
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,959
right now it's nothing what it

133
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,399
essentially is is nothing more than a

134
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:20,959
second display

135
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:21,839
you can hook it up to anything like a

136
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,600
computer

137
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:25,599
or a camera or a mobile and it will

138
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,680
essentially act as a second display

139
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,360
either mirroring the output or if i

140
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,600
connect it up to my laptop

141
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,280
it will uh basically act as a second

142
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:36,000
screen

143
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,280
um the initial the initial approach i

144
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,479
wanted to take was

145
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:41,280
um to show to basically build some web

146
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:43,280
applications

147
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,320
and then stream it from my mobile to the

148
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,719
glasses but

149
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:48,479
the issue i had here was that it wasn't

150
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,479
really ideal because

151
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:51,758
that the screen would have to be on at

152
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:54,479
all times

153
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:56,639
and and i also wouldn't be able to touch

154
00:04:54,479 --> 00:05:00,000
it if i would want to put it away

155
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:02,000
so i realized that i needed another

156
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,120
component

157
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,039
and for that i wanted to step over

158
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,400
to a raspberry pi now i assume most

159
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:10,159
people here have played around with a

160
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:14,159
raspberry pi or heard of it

161
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:16,639
with your fans yeah expect this much

162
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,840
so yeah raspberry pi is just a really

163
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:19,520
cheap computer

164
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:21,198
running on raspbian which is a sort of a

165
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,880
linux-like environment

166
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,400
and at the moment i just have attached

167
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:28,159
to my glasses right here

168
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:29,758
on my left it's incredibly small

169
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,120
like almost the size of a credit card

170
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:32,479
size these days and they're just really

171
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,320
powerful that they also have bluetooth

172
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:36,320
and wifi blah blah blah

173
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:39,280
and finally to get the whole thing up

174
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:41,440
and running i needed nothing more

175
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:43,520
than a simple power bank because the

176
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:46,560
raspberry pi itself can run

177
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:50,159
via a mini usb connector

178
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:52,320
and when you

179
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,000
and it runs a very low power so when i

180
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,560
have it uh hooked up to a power bank

181
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,479
it's

182
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:59,520
i've used it at the very least for at

183
00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:01,280
least an hour or so

184
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,880
and when you put all of those together

185
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,840
you essentially i was able to get my own

186
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:08,560
smart glasses running

187
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:10,000
but uh but then i ran into one

188
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,919
particular big problem and that is that

189
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,960
the viewfinder doesn't have any input uh

190
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:15,039
it's

191
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,159
it's cheap at the moment because uh it

192
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:18,960
doesn't add that much

193
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,720
uh functionality so it doesn't have any

194
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,080
input most other smart glasses like the

195
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,919
viewfinder have a touchpad or something

196
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,758
that you can use to interact

197
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:28,318
uh with the apps but the viewfinder

198
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:28,880
doesn't so for that i started building

199
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:32,000
on a

200
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:34,639
personal platform which i've called ruby

201
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,319
now what is ruby first off i would say a

202
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:37,759
bit of a narcissistic name for a project

203
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:39,039
but it's something i came up with in the

204
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:40,800
middle of the night

205
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:43,199
uh but what it's actually meant to be is

206
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,120
a platform for uh wearables for

207
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,880
glasses like these in which the focus

208
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,680
remains on prototyping because i really

209
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,360
don't think

210
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,599
that by myself i'll be able to build

211
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,199
something which is really ready for

212
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:55,120
production

213
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:56,960
and given that i'm a web developer it's

214
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:59,039
also something that i really wanted to

215
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:02,080
work entirely with web technology so

216
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:03,919
like with html and javascript

217
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,280
the first part of the robot platform is

218
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:07,120
just a display app

219
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,719
which is running right here it's nothing

220
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:12,080
more than a simple

221
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:13,120
single page application written in

222
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:16,318
view.js

223
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:19,520
it has a couple of apps written in it

224
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:22,560
like like a camera and google maps

225
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:24,159
when the raspberry pi boots uh

226
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,720
it essentially just opens chrome in

227
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,560
kiosk mode and in full screen mode

228
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,319
so that all what i'll be able to see

229
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,960
here is the display

230
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:34,160
is to view the display app and every app

231
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,318
that i've built so far

232
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:38,160
is essentially just a page in view dot

233
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:39,759
here so if i want to open the camera app

234
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,840
it just goes to the camera

235
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:44,240
page and the view router handles the

236
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:47,679
rest

237
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,240
but then the next uh problem approach

238
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,560
which was

239
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,240
essentially input like how should i be

240
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,160
able to actually be able to communicate

241
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,599
with the raspberry pi here and go to the

242
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:58,800
camera page

243
00:07:55,599 --> 00:08:01,599
or the google maps and

244
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,240
for that i just came up i tried a couple

245
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:03,680
of things

246
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,639
first i just tried to do it via the

247
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,639
gamepad api

248
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:14,719
oh did it fall down here

249
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:16,639
testing one two three all right cool i

250
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,560
really haven't noticed

251
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:20,319
uh what i've written was uh what i've

252
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,479
created is a simple remote web

253
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:25,599
application which i can

254
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:26,000
open from my mobile which essentially

255
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:28,719
just works

256
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,319
as a remote control and what it

257
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:32,320
basically just does is it

258
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:33,839
keeps sending messages back and forth

259
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:36,159
via socket io which is a

260
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:37,599
easy library to send real-time messages

261
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:40,080
back and forth

262
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:41,039
and honestly the best way uh to showcase

263
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,880
just how this works

264
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:44,800
i've prepared a little demo to show how

265
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,399
the camera works

266
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:48,319
uh now the viewfinder also doesn't come

267
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:51,519
with the camera itself so what i've

268
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,959
done here is i've bought a usb endoscope

269
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:54,000
which is just a small camera which is

270
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:57,760
essentially meant to get

271
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,120
to easy to hard hard to reach places

272
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,399
and using nothing more than simple

273
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:03,200
rubber bands i've attached it to the

274
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:03,200
viewfinder itself

275
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:08,480
and then just to show how it works here

276
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,320
in the upper right it's just the robot

277
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,560
platform that you would normally have

278
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,360
and then here is the mobile app and i

279
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:16,079
can just press

280
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,760
camera and then it opens an application

281
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,399
which

282
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,680
uses the usb camera to get it which

283
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:24,160
would normally be the endoscope but it's

284
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:27,599
now using the webcam from my uh

285
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:29,600
laptop and when i press take photo here

286
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,120
it just sends a message to the display

287
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,240
that hey i want to take a picture from

288
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,399
uh

289
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:36,320
i want to take a picture and then it

290
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:37,920
just creates your base64 string which it

291
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:40,080
sends back to the uh

292
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,360
mobile and then i can just press save

293
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:44,800
images

294
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,800
to store it locally on my device

295
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:49,519
uh some other apps that i've built with

296
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,880
it are

297
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:52,560
the first one is for me actually the

298
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,680
most important one which is just a

299
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,160
simple browser

300
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:57,599
and in general i use so i can just open

301
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:00,160
any page here

302
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,839
most of the time i use this uh to hear

303
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:03,519
the presentation notes for my talk

304
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:05,440
itself

305
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:07,040
on a side note this has also been sort

306
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,480
of my holy grail

307
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,800
when it comes to the smart glasses

308
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,560
because uh i often give talks and i just

309
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,160
want to be able to see my notes

310
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,920
and i want to have them projected right

311
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,199
here i'm using it at the moment and

312
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,959
this is something that i've been playing

313
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,519
around with for about two to three years

314
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:22,640
now

315
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:25,760
and the first prototype well they needed

316
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:28,240
there is improvement now

317
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,760
uh some other apps that i've written is

318
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,279
youtube so i can watch any type of

319
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,519
youtube video here which is excellent

320
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:35,279
when you're walking the dog

321
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:36,720
but also when i want to get from point a

322
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:39,040
to point b i've built

323
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,320
google maps using the google maps api

324
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:43,360
and the image api to

325
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,839
display the map here and this one may be

326
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:48,160
a little bit freaky but

327
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:51,200
um personally i'm really terrible with

328
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:52,719
faces and names so using face api i'm

329
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,880
actually able to do some sort of

330
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,480
facial recognition so that whenever i

331
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,040
look at someone and it's unable to

332
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,519
actually

333
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,800
recognize the person then it gets added

334
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:02,800
to the uh

335
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,319
list here and then i can just tap on

336
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,640
them and and then i can

337
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,920
insert their name so this way the next

338
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,920
time when i walk up to someone i know

339
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,880
that oh oh it's anton or uh hey hey it's

340
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,599
irene

341
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:15,040
so and for me that could be a great help

342
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:18,320
for the record i haven't tried this in

343
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,319
an actual environment yet

344
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:23,920
what i've shown you so far mostly is

345
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,199
something that i mostly just hacked

346
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:27,199
together using

347
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,480
angular and view personally i just

348
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,680
wasn't really happy with the whole

349
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,200
concept because

350
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:33,680
every time when i wanted to add a new

351
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,440
app i would have to add a page to the

352
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:37,519
remote control which was written in

353
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,279
angular and then something in view

354
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:41,360
how they communicated back and forth was

355
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:43,600
just a little bit of a mess

356
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,800
so i just started to rewrite the whole

357
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,760
thing

358
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:49,279
um in which the focus was to create

359
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,720
something which is usually a low barrier

360
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:51,279
approach to wearables and with that i

361
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,120
mean

362
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:55,040
just to offer a platform to developers

363
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,639
which would give them an idea on how

364
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:59,599
oh and how they can just build simple

365
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:01,279
apps uh for a smart glasses

366
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,720
it's something that could technically

367
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:04,240
might be ready for production but i

368
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,600
would say the biggest issue here is that

369
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,320
the form factor would also need to be

370
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,279
improved and i

371
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,480
have absolutely no experience with that

372
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:12,320
the biggest thing is

373
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,480
is that i want the whole project to be

374
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,480
web-based and framework agnostic

375
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:18,079
essentially meaning that i wanted

376
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,560
developers to be able to build their

377
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:22,160
very own apps using whatever tools there

378
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,680
they personally want to use so that you

379
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,319
essentially could build an app using

380
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:27,599
either view

381
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,160
or angular jquery or vanilla javascript

382
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,360
type it

383
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:33,120
whatever you want and uh how the

384
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:35,839
and i just wanted to streamline then how

385
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:38,639
the remote would work via the mobile

386
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:39,600
and to demonstrate this i'll uh i would

387
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:41,920
like to walk you guys

388
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:44,320
uh through a simple example on how i can

389
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:46,479
now build a ruby app in the new platform

390
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,440
uh the example itself is that i want to

391
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,519
be able to

392
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:51,200
show a simple uh to-do list here with

393
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:52,160
the items that i still need to do i want

394
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:55,360
to be able to

395
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:58,160
add new items or remove them

396
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,639
now to start building these type of apps

397
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,399
first

398
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:02,399
there's here's an app directory that has

399
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:05,040
uh all the different

400
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:06,000
apps that are available on the platform

401
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,839
and the

402
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,480
name that you give to the directory sort

403
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:13,440
of use as an internal identifier

404
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:15,360
you have to add a configuration file uh

405
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,880
containing an iron icon and a name now

406
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:19,040
an iron icon is just

407
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:20,240
a reference to an id in the iron icons

408
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:22,800
library which is

409
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:25,600
sort of familiar to font awesome this is

410
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:28,000
mostly just a temporary solution

411
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:30,160
and i really want to use your developers

412
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:33,120
users to be able to use their own

413
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:34,560
icons and whatever name you give them is

414
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:38,160
how they will show up on the

415
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:41,119
app page next you'll want to

416
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:42,800
add just a simple index.html file which

417
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,800
is what will be served

418
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,839
which the display will show if the user

419
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,519
clicks an app

420
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:49,360
so in this particular case i've now just

421
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:51,680
created a very simple page

422
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,720
with a red background and the next time

423
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:55,359
when the user clicks

424
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,639
on the to-do list this is what they'll

425
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,560
see right here

426
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:59,839
so the to-do app would have been opened

427
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,439
at this point

428
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:03,680
now next what we want to do is actually

429
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,519
add some functionality that we can

430
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,959
so that we can actually communicate here

431
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:09,120
via the

432
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:10,399
remote controls and for that i've

433
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,480
written a simple

434
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:14,880
helper class in which you can just pass

435
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:18,240
along a list of

436
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:20,240
inputs form inputs

437
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,440
which in addition example what i first

438
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:23,360
want to do is i want to give people the

439
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:25,360
opportunity to add an item

440
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,399
so you can just give so i'm giving it

441
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:29,199
two items

442
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:29,519
a text input and a button and so when

443
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:31,920
this

444
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:33,199
area is sent from the display to the

445
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,959
remote controls

446
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:37,680
then on the remote controls you'll see

447
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:37,680
something like this

448
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:41,439
now and here also for the button i've

449
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:42,880
also indicated that

450
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:45,680
if the user would click the button on

451
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:48,720
their mobile then on the display app

452
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:49,599
this function will be called so if the

453
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,519
user has

454
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,279
filled something in and they press add

455
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:54,720
item then the app here will get an event

456
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:57,279
for that and then you can just add the

457
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:59,760
item itself to a list

458
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:01,199
so this here will ensure that the to-do

459
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,800
items will appear right here on the

460
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:05,359
viewfinder

461
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:07,120
now what you want to do next also is uh

462
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:09,680
to allow the user to be able to remove

463
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:12,320
any to-do items after they finish them

464
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:13,599
and to and essentially it's practically

465
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:16,000
doing the same thing as i did before

466
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:18,639
with the add item so

467
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,639
if you uh

468
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:26,880
yeah sorry for that

469
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:31,758
um and the um

470
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:35,440
so when there are any items in the to-do

471
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:38,399
list

472
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:40,079
then i'll just i'll add a divider along

473
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:42,959
with the title uh

474
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:44,079
saying remove items and then for each

475
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:45,599
item that i have

476
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:47,040
i'll add a button with the name of the

477
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,079
text with the id that if you press the

478
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:50,560
button it will then

479
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:52,079
remove it from the to-do list again so

480
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,758
in this particular example

481
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:56,319
i'm now sending the following

482
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:59,120
information to the display itself

483
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:00,959
so above first again the two items which

484
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:03,519
allow you to add something

485
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:05,518
but after that i also add a button for

486
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:08,399
each list on the

487
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:08,880
uh an item for i will add a button from

488
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:11,440
each

489
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,800
item that is currently in the to-do list

490
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:14,079
and so then on the remote control you

491
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,399
will get something that looks

492
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:19,040
like this so the user can easily just

493
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:21,440
press the button to indicate that hey

494
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:22,959
i've done this particular task and

495
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,519
removing items is again nothing more

496
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:26,638
than just

497
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:29,279
updating the array and sending a new

498
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:29,839
updated list to the remote control and

499
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,680
for me

500
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:33,120
the most thing that i'm happy about here

501
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,880
is that this particular

502
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,399
example i was able to put together in

503
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,920
about 20 minutes

504
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:39,680
and that in the end has always been for

505
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:41,360
me the main priority uh

506
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:43,279
for this project that i just want to be

507
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:46,320
able to create simple

508
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:49,519
uh tools uh to try out my own things

509
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:51,120
uh with uh with smart glasses

510
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:52,959
and that's essentially in the end also

511
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,600
what this whole entire project has been

512
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:56,479
about

513
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,440
um uh personally it's also just been a

514
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:00,240
really

515
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:02,240
fun way to just step outside my usual

516
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,920
flow of html and javascript and just

517
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,039
try out some new stuff so that's one of

518
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,559
the things that i'm just really happy

519
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:09,280
about and it just

520
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:11,599
and what i'm just mostly amazed about is

521
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:13,760
um

522
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:15,039
that i'm capable of doing this with just

523
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:18,480
a simple hardware

524
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:21,039
that's available right off the shelf uh

525
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,160
well to round off uh thank you for them

526
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:24,640
for uh

527
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:26,799
giving me this platform to speak i also

528
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:28,240
want to do a very quick shout out

529
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:31,200
uh to my parents who are currently

530
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:33,750
watching live hi mom hi dad

531
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:42,539
and with that thank you very

532
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:42,539
[Applause]

533
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,840
are you much

534
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,480
hi what is the total cost of the project

535
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,919
like how much did you spend on the old

536
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:59,520
hardware

537
00:17:55,919 --> 00:18:03,039
um let's see the few so the question is

538
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:05,440
how much the hardware is right yeah

539
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:07,600
the fuel fine is about 100 euros and

540
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:10,320
then the raspberry pi is around 20

541
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,320
30 euros or

542
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:18,400
for speech so uh

543
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:21,600
there is a google board for raspberry pi

544
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:23,919
which you can use for speech recognition

545
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,959
and you can integrate it like and just

546
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:29,840
make google glass

547
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:29,840
like from scratch what's it called

548
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,520
i'm going to look it up thanks

549
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:43,840
did you think to use some kind of

550
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,840
3d printed

551
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:50,000
casing because the project is cool but

552
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,639
it looks a little bit kind of a mess it

553
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,360
does so

554
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,840
no i completely agree so did you try

555
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,000
because

556
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:57,678
you can select you can order a

557
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,640
custom-made

558
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:01,360
just yeah so the question is whether i'm

559
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,960
i've actually

560
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:04,879
tried out something anything with a 3d

561
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:06,960
printed case all i can say at the moment

562
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:08,799
it's been in the back of my mind

563
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,240
i have some friends who have printers

564
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:10,799
and i do want to sit with them at some

565
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,160
point

566
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:14,559
and see if we can actually create

567
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,840
something better looking than this but

568
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:17,360
yeah then you also need to have the

569
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,639
battery and everything implemented so i

570
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,559
think that's going to be the challenge

571
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:22,799
there

572
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:24,000
just a quick remark if trevor also is

573
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:25,440
watching uh

574
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,880
there are people from across the world

575
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:29,520
who are interested in the project and

576
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:31,919
who do have 3d printing skill and design

577
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:34,240
to indeed combine the case and

578
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:36,400
everything so

579
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,520
thank you thanks for the presentation uh

580
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,960
just a quick one when do you think the

581
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,360
hardware is going to be able to catch up

582
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,720
with

583
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:45,360
the um software

584
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:47,200
question when will the hardware reduce

585
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:49,600
in size enough that it will just be

586
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,840
in someone's glasses they will be

587
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:53,039
available at

588
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:54,240
opticians so the question is when the

589
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:56,400
hardware will be available

590
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:58,000
uh for uh for the glass itself and yeah

591
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,840
and then i'm just afraid that i'm just

592
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,120
not much of a hardware person and i'm

593
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:03,039
really not following that enough at the

594
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:04,559
moment to give a proper answer

595
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:05,919
i know that there is at the very least

596
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:07,120
there are glasses out there called the

597
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:09,520
fusix blade which

598
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:11,600
looks remarkably like normal glasses and

599
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,960
projects them

600
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:15,520
and projects the text actually on the

601
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:17,280
glasses itself but

602
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:19,440
those are also like really expensive at

603
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:21,678
the moment so

604
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,799
quick remark when the next person thinks

605
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:26,400
of the question

606
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:29,679
uh for this you have for example the

607
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:31,679
face by north uh and it's

608
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:33,280
about 600 dollars more or less and they

609
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:35,360
look roughly like your glasses

610
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:36,480
the branch are a bit thicker but not so

611
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:38,719
much

612
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:40,400
they do have a small display i think the

613
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:42,559
interaction is very limited

614
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:44,240
but this you can buy not at a normal

615
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:45,840
optician they have like two shops in the

616
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,520
u.s one in toronto or

617
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:50,000
north america one in toronto one in

618
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,720
brooklyn but they are going to ship a

619
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,760
version 2

620
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:55,919
anywhere in the world will they be

621
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:57,200
on ribbon's platform it's still to be

622
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:58,799
discussed

623
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,320
and this is the kind of hardware

624
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:03,520
basically the geekiest you look

625
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:04,399
the more powerful internal features but

626
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:08,080
then the more

627
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:10,559
normal the look the less

628
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:13,120
features or like depth sensing or

629
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:16,158
anything you can get

630
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:18,080
off yes uh

631
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:19,679
since you're still thinking i just saw

632
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:21,918
that which is

633
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:23,760
as clownish as it gets it's the better

634
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:24,400
appeal that i nearly stepped on you to

635
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:27,039
keep the mic

636
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,600
so please when you leave the room i see

637
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:30,320
like a

638
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:32,158
coffee cans and everything please do

639
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:33,760
pick it up it's a volunteer based event

640
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:35,440
if you don't pick it up then

641
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,960
we don't actually come to the uld next

642
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,760
time because we're not welcome anymore

643
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,840
so

644
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:42,080
please to pick up whatever it doesn't

645
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:45,280
have to be yours this is not my banana

646
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:48,480
i'm going to throw it somewhere

647
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:51,520
so next yeah thank you

648
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:53,280
hey have you experienced with using a

649
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:56,320
small camera as a

650
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:59,760
eye tracker for a interface instead of

651
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:00,480
buttons or voice um not in particular

652
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:03,520
yeah and

653
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:06,000
are there any keep variants uh

654
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:07,039
well i don't have anything specific in

655
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,799
mind but but

656
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:12,559
as you have attached a small outward

657
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:14,158
facing camera perhaps there could be an

658
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:16,080
even smaller one facing your

659
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:18,080
own iris and perhaps do that some kind

660
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:20,720
of tracking for

661
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:21,520
a look up to the right for okay and left

662
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,919
something like that

663
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,559
i like the idea of basically using an

664
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:26,080
eye tracker

665
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:28,000
to control the user interface but

666
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,960
already the endoscope that i'm using at

667
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,480
the moment i

668
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:33,120
already bought it off a very sketchy

669
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:35,200
website and uh

670
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:36,320
it has very low quality so i don't think

671
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,760
it would even be able to

672
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:40,639
recognize you but i do really like the

673
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:42,480
idea something to keep in mind

674
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:44,080
so we have time for a couple more

675
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:47,840
questions

676
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:47,840
with an ideas suggestion yeah

677
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:54,959
i believe towards the end of his life

678
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:57,600
so yeah just to comment that you could

679
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:58,559
also use muscular muscular features of

680
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,399
your face

681
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:02,399
to do some control it sounds really

682
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:04,640
interesting

683
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,520
there is a project also at mit at the

684
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:08,480
media lab on

685
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:08,879
using i think the i don't know what

686
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,039
those

687
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:13,120
muscles are cool but you you have just a

688
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:15,200
whisper you don't actually say anything

689
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:16,399
and and in terms of the richness of

690
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,720
interaction

691
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:20,240
it is quite good uh in term of input it

692
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:23,840
works really well and i think it's open

693
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:23,840
source but i'm not sure

694
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:32,799
couple more still ideas suggestions

695
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:37,840
questions doubts no doubts

696
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:37,840
my feedback is i don't mind feedback

697
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:48,240
have you thought of using computer

698
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:50,159
vision for recognizing

699
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:54,000
hand gestures using the small camera

700
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:54,000
that's already built into the device

701
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:58,159
using uh hand gestures uh as a form of

702
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:01,200
control

703
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:04,480
uh you have the camera already

704
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:05,200
on your device so you can try to do

705
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:08,320
something with

706
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:11,679
opencv to um recognize

707
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:14,720
the recognize certain hand gestures

708
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:15,200
and using those hand gestures to control

709
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,440
the

710
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:19,039
device right so the ideas essentially

711
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,559
show that uh that with the camera that i

712
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:22,000
can put in here it's able to track my

713
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:23,279
hand here and then i could like swipe

714
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,360
back and forth

715
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:26,799
uh is that correct yeah that's actually

716
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:28,639
also a really cool idea i'm

717
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:30,480
i'm really glad that you guys are giving

718
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:33,840
me the ideas

719
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,840
so thanks for that

720
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:47,840
if you've got bluetooth

721
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,678
if if you've got bluetooth on the

722
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:55,200
raspberry pi you could use a

723
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:56,000
a wireless mouse to move the pointer and

724
00:24:55,200 --> 00:25:00,320
have an on-screen

725
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:03,200
keyboard on the on the web interface

726
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:04,080
um so yeah using the bluetooth api uh as

727
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,919
a

728
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:07,039
as a tracker uh that's also one of the

729
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:07,440
things that i've been playing around

730
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:10,320
with

731
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:11,679
mostly just using the gamepad api but

732
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,158
the biggest issue where i ran across

733
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:13,600
there

734
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:15,440
is essentially that i would then have to

735
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,719
create a whole interface here

736
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,760
and when i started out with the project

737
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,799
there was just a little bit too much

738
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,480
work like i would have to create a

739
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:22,158
versatile keyboard and everything

740
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:24,000
but it is one of the things that i am

741
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:26,960
interested in trying out uh

742
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,000
in the future um if you can point the

743
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:31,279
camera

744
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:33,760
into your eye you can also use uh uh

745
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:34,480
pupil movement tracker eye movement

746
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,919
tracker

747
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:38,400
and i think that's one of the ideas that

748
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:42,000
where that was suggested earlier yeah

749
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:56,880
yeah then yeah it's also quite

750
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:56,880
you so much
