1
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:08,639
so

2
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:10,719
welcome to palindrome day in all three

3
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:12,320
major systems the first time in over 900

4
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:13,440
years it'll take a few more than 100 for

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,440
the next one

6
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,480
not that anything other than iso dates

7
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,480
matters but

8
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,680
like we have it in all me three major

9
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,240
ones

10
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,720
um same as last year same as the one

11
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,119
before

12
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:26,880
same as for quite some time now we are

13
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:28,320
the world's largest conference and you

14
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,198
are part of this

15
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,679
we have a ton of events we have endless

16
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:33,440
uh

17
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:35,360
so i need to read it out here we have

18
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:39,360
893 events

19
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:42,719
450 hours of content 836 speakers

20
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:45,360
uh 67 deaf rooms 72 tracks

21
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:47,200
63 stands all of those numbers went up

22
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,399
which is good

23
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,120
um we saw quite a few less mac addresses

24
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,559
this year

25
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,800
for the simple reason that we got better

26
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:56,320
at filtering out the stupid which

27
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,718
people were doing

28
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:01,760
and also people played less so we had

29
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:03,440
roughly 11k mac addresses on the network

30
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,798
um we strengthened the network

31
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,640
protections even a little bit more

32
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:09,840
because we kind of needed to but

33
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:12,720
that works so

34
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,159
we almost doubled the amount of swag

35
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,200
which we had

36
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,880
still things were gone on for noon of

37
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,560
the first day basically

38
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,320
some things reached even into the

39
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,720
afternoon but we need to scale

40
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,399
this up even more we are doing this

41
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,759
slowly because we don't want to

42
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,159
get into a situation where we have to

43
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:32,479
throw away tons of t-shirts and such

44
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:35,280
but yeah we obviously need more um this

45
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:35,840
year the record is the 3xl t-shirt which

46
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,200
