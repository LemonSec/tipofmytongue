specialty but we do other things too

16
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:41,920

17
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:44,879
what are the progressive who knows what

18
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,879
are progressive web apps

19
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,520
a bit more than that but yeah good good

20
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,320
point okay and who is

21
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,199
actually developing progressive web apps

22
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,680
okay

23
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:57,360
quite a few people okay interesting so

24
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,960
yeah so so there are actually many

25
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:03,359
definitions of progressive web apps i

26
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:06,560
i chose just a random one um

27
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:08,320
it's a set of technologies and they

28
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:11,280
it's not it's a bit blurred the lines

29
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:14,479
are not completely clear

30
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:16,000
this is just an addition to a web option

31
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:17,840
i can we can say it's a it's a

32
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,400
progressive enhancement

33
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,920
uh yeah so the stuff the typical stuff

34
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,560
that we when we think about progressive

35
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,240
web apps

36
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,720
are for example that they are available

37
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:29,839
offline they load fast

38
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:32,720
they use https always they

39
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,520
they are responsive i will talk about

40
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,920

80
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,400
my phone right

81
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,560

82
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,840
my phone

83
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,080
yeah so first thing i will talk about

84
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,440
this later ah well first thing what will

85
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,400
happen well

86
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:13,040
i can just i can just visit the link

87
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:15,040
right i hope i don't have any

88
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:17,040
further certain rocks i can just visit

89
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:20,720
my link and that's how it would look

90
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:22,720
so it's a website basically it's loading

91
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,480
uh it's loading the entire phone

92
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:27,920
schedule that's why it takes a bit

93
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:29,440
um yeah

94
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,518
and that's how it how it looks i can i

95
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:33,840
can click on a keynote

96
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:35,280
i can click on it we'll come back to

97
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,680
this later this thing that i just

98
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,680
appeared

99
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:43,760
stay tuned there are a couple of things

100
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,440
one killer feature actually here that i

101
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:47,518
consider a killer feature is the

102
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:50,159
is the fact that you notice that there

103
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:52,959
is a lot of things happening at fosdem

104
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:53,679
uh and for me the only way to actually

105
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:56,400
enjoy actually

106
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:58,159
the second false demo 2013 i think

107
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,959
that's 2012. so the second was them i

108
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:03,040
arrived i discovered mobile apps

109
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,400
and this actually allowed me to before

110
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,760
coming here to take a look on the

111
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,400
program and actually decide what i want

112
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,079
to see

113
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,640
so for me the killer feature here in

114
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:12,640
this app is the fact that you can

115
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:14,720
you can bookmark things right so you can

116
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,679
click on a link and i can bookmark it so

117
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,279
for example

118
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,720
like i wanted to bookmark the last one

119
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:20,719
so i bookmarked it

120
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,479
and then i can i can take a look at my

121
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,600
bookmarks during the day and i can only

122
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:25,120
choose from the talks i already

123
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,960
pre-selected right so i have some time

124
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,400
to actually read the description because

125
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,479
each of those stocks i can read the full

126
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,919
description let's close this

127
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:33,520
i can read the full description i can i

128
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:35,039
can get a bit more informed

129
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,799
by the way there are also links at the

130
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,320
bottom you can also submit feedback from

131
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,960
this app it's not directly from this app

132
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,360
but yeah

133
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,400
i invite you to feed the same feedback

134
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,440
also through this

135
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,799
through to the app so yeah so that's

136
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:50,160
that's it for the short demo

137
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:53,680
uh we'll come back to this later uh

138
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:56,160
so uh so coming back to my app

139
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,440
oh yeah let me just finish because it's

140
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,800
actually a progressive website so the

141
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,479
thing is that is that is actually

142
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,039
interesting is that

143
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:05,039
i can use i can visit the same site on

144
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:07,280
the on the on the desktop right and i

145
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:09,120
have a i have this this is the same app

146
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,719
i have i have a different interface

147
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,240
because the the device is so different

148
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,919
that we just we decided to

149
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,280
to change completely interface for the

150
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:18,479
for the desktop

151
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:20,960
but uh but yeah this is the same app

152
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:21,599
uh it's it's basically a website as i

153
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,440
was saying

154
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,960
before right the progressive apps are

155
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:28,000
basically websites

156
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:30,080
right as in the definition okay uh

157
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,320
let's see how our way with the time okay

158
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:36,800
great uh

159
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:39,680
so uh so yeah a bit of stats okay so

160
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,720
so yesterday i had about 600 visits uh

161
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,039
it's the same as

162
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,919
awesome it's it's like 30 more than the

163
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:45,120
last year but

164
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:47,198
this is not the best metric so i

165
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,960
actually have 165 users who added more

166
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:50,880
than five bookmarks i consider them

167
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,159
active users i can i can track it

168
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:55,120
somehow i will tell you

169
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:56,479
later about this actually you can be

170
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,199
completely

171
00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:00,479
anonymous with this app or you can

172
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,639
decide to log in

173
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:04,560
and and then or well i obviously

174
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:06,160
wouldn't wouldn't track you but yeah i

175
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,600
this this way actually i can also

176
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,120
anonymously see how many how many

177
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,680
bookmarks people add

178
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,479
so i can see this and the second later

179
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,319
usage is that

180
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:16,318
actually in december i also adapted it

181
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:18,639
to another conference so

182
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:20,560
very very quickly very easily basically

183
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:24,080
this is one function that converts the

184
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:26,160
the schedule to a common um to a common

185
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,919
format and this way i can use it for a

186
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,360
different conference and i change the

187
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:30,400
interface a bit with the configuration

188
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,560
file

189
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,560
so that's actually for flowcon which is

190
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,960
for process geeks for

191
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:39,280
for software process gigs agile this

192
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:41,120
kind of stuff but but cool cool people

193
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,479
also also geeks not not like those

194
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:46,319
corporates

195
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:48,000
you know uh yeah hierarchical

196
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:50,479
managers and stuff no no those people

197
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,759
are very nice i recommend in paris

198
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:56,479
uh okay uh so enough about the

199
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:57,039
my app so i want to talk about just the

200
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:58,880
three

201
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:00,639
things about progressive web apps you i

202
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,520
wouldn't give you a full full overview

203
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:03,360
of progressive

204
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,799
it's much broader subject we just have

205
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,440
20 minutes

206
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,400
so uh so i just focus on those three

207
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,560
things

208
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:12,719
i invite you to talk about the others

209
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,400
obviously what is missing here

210
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,240
uh well i one thing i want to talk about

211
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,638
that i removed in the end uh it was

212
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,800
about

213
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:20,479
about persistent storage so you can

214
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,720
actually you can actually

215
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:24,318
store stuff persistent consistently on

216
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,440
the device so basically it works like a

217
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:27,199
mobile app

218
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,880
so there's no need to register there's

219
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:30,639
no need to create an account or anything

220
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:32,800
i just i can just run my app

221
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:34,080
and store my data there right it's it's

222
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,319
actually possible

223
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,599
it's it's very it's it works across

224
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:39,680
platforms as well

225
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:41,360
so i can actually never contact any i

226
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,960
mean i can just download my app and just

227
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,520
use it never connect to the network

228
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:47,120
again

229
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:49,359
and another thing that is missing here

230
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,680
is push notifications um we all hate

231
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,520
them

232
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,879
uh sometimes they are useful actually

233
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,080
for a conference could be for example

234
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:55,680
useful if there's a

235
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:57,440
an emergency or there's something that

236
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,479
could be actually useful to do i haven't

237
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:01,599
haven't implemented them

238
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:03,680
in the app yet but i probably do it uh

239
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:04,639
okay so let's talk about the those three

240
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,599
those three things

241
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:09,440
so the offline first um so the app

242
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:13,120
actually is offline first uh

243
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:14,639
so well maybe a bit of technology okay

244
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:17,680
so so let's let's talk about

245
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:20,479
uh about service workers for a bit

246
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:22,000
so actually service workers are are just

247
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:23,919
are a proxy

248
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,120
basically a proxy between your app and

249
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:27,599
the network

250
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,639
that allows you to to store the data

251
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:30,319
right on the

252
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:32,479
in the proxy so never conduct the

253
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:34,560
network again for example

254
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:36,320
offline first is just one of the of the

255
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:37,119
options actually you can have all the

256
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,839
mixes

257
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,640
so actually that's what i did is in this

258
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:43,360
app so

259
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:44,159
uh i'm actually pre-caching all the

260
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,800
resources

261
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:47,920
or the static stuff or we call it shell

262
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,920
i i pre-cache

263
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:51,839
all the html css and images and

264
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,560
everything the first time you visit site

265
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:54,480
and then

266
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,000
it shouldn't be requested again unless

267
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,720
it's updated i will talk about this

268
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,360
update

269
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,080
in a second so this is actually i call

270
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:04,080
it i

271
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:06,720
i consider it static right

272
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:08,959
then there is another very interesting

273
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:12,000
resource that is that is not so static

274
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:14,560
which is actually a schedule

275
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
which is changing a lot uh more than uh

276
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,839
than uh

277
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,240
then i would hope so i mean i i need to

278
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:22,800
probably change up the app a little bit

279
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:25,040
uh but for this uh for this uh resource

280
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,319
i use a special strategy because in the

281
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,319
service worker you can have different

282
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,080
strategies right there so there's a good

283
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,880
good results about this at the end i i

284
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,440
send a link

285
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,320
i added a link so actually what happens

286
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,160
here

287
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,680
if you follow the the numbers right so

288
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,839
the first i have my browser

289
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,359
my page will request the service worker

290
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:42,720
for a schedule

291
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,000
and then schedule and then the service

292
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,800
worker will check if the schedule is

293
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,560
already in cache

294
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,800
and if it's already in cache number

295
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:51,199
three it will respond

296
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,719
at the same time it will send a request

297
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,680
to the network to check if there is a

298
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,920
new version

299
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:57,599
so this way we you can have your your

300
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,199
schedule immediately visible i don't

301
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:02,480
have to wait for a network if i'm

302
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:04,320
on a gps or something or 3g

303
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:06,800
but in the background the schedule will

304
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,640
actually update and if it updates

305
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,000
that's actually this is also pretty cool

306
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:12,399
uh what we can do

307
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,079
what i can do is i can catch the signal

308
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:16,399
this this oh exactly this is

309
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:18,000
because it's changing all the time so i

310
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:19,600
can show you a quick demo

311
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,519
so actually this message that you see

312
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,640
here the new schedules available is

313
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:24,320
actually this so

314
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:27,040
in the background i actually send a

315
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,880
request the the schedule itself is about

316
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,959
it's couple of megabytes so it's pretty

317
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,399
big json file and also pretty expensive

318
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:35,920
to parse

319
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:39,839
uh so um so that's why i

320
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:40,479
um yeah so so so i make this request in

321
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:43,760
the background

322
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:45,600
um the user can actually i can i can

323
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,480
either force the user to refresh but

324
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,720
that could be a bit

325
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,240
abrupt maybe i will do it later or i can

326
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,360
i reckon i should show a message to ask

327
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,399
the user do you want to refresh the

328
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,079
schedule now or not

329
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:55,600
yeah so i can click refresh it's a bit

330
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:56,880
slow to be honest i need to i need to

331
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:59,360
put it in another

332
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:01,760
tread probably so now the schedule

333
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:04,240
should be updated

334
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:07,360
uh the schedule itself right the talks

335
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:10,560
itself descriptions videos links etc

336
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:13,839
uh and the third thing and

337
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:15,359
and the first types of resources uh i

338
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:18,800
would like to consider

339
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:20,240
discuss here are the are the resources

340
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,760
that are actually real time

341
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,680
so this is another killer feature i

342
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,800
didn't tell you about so so i'm not

343
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,959
caching them at all

344
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,399
so there is a little thingy i noticed

345
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:29,119
that it's not completely clear what it

346
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:32,079
is that's why

347
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,880
ux ui is very important but actually ah

348
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:35,279
what

349
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:37,279
okay let's continue like this so uxi is

350
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:39,519
actually this little thingy this little

351
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:40,880
symbol means that the room is full

352
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:42,800
actually

353
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,000
yeah that means i i want yeah well we

354
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,160
can also check this room but

355
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,079
this this thing is actually coming from

356
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,719
fosdem there's a fosdem api that shows

357
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:51,439
you the room's

358
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,839
room is full or empty the the little

359
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:55,360
thing

360
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:57,760
yeah it tells you that the room is full

361
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:59,279
right it should be something some i try

362
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:01,200
to save space here that's why it should

363
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:02,720
be some some information about this

364
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,160
but this is another cool thing and this

365
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,760
is actually real time so if i lose

366
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:09,600
connection this will stop

367
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:11,519
updating basically or disappear exactly

368
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,200
okay so this is about offline the second

369
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:13,680
offline first cool thing about offline

370
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:17,200
first

371
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:19,199
i wanted to show you is actually the

372
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:22,959
fact that i can

373
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:24,560
i can search so i i never considered

374
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:26,160
this but actually

375
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:28,719
you know actually i didn't i didn't show

376
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:30,959
you this but i should actually

377
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,480
i should actually go offline right well

378
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:34,399
you're talking about offline third

379
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,839
so so yeah sorry i forgot to do it so

380
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:38,160
basically i'm offline right so i can

381
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:39,760
search for progressive web apps and the

382
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:42,639
search works because it's fully

383
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:44,800
i have all the index on the on the local

384
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:46,959
device right oops

385
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:49,760
so i can so i can search locally without

386
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:52,638
any access to network

387
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:53,760
you can search for javascript so this is

388
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:57,680
pretty cool actually what i

389
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:59,760
how the way i did it is actually

390
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:01,599
pretty simple i just i just search in

391
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:03,360
the in a json file i do some simple

392
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,320
ranking so the title is more important

393
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,519
than the other things

394
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,440
but that's very simple you can actually

395
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:09,519
you can have full search engines in

396
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:12,480
javascript on the client side

397
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:13,360
okay enough about uh front-end about the

398
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,480
offline first

399
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,880
now something about installation so so

400
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,399
what

401
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:20,079
so the how the how the progressive app

402
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:21,200
actually installs this is pretty magical

403
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:22,959
actually the first time you visit a

404
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:25,920
website

405
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:27,599
the the the site in the installs itself

406
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:30,240
and the user has nothing to do with it

407
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,200
actually then there's something that we

408
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,519
more consider

409
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,800
as a as an installation it will be we

410
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:36,320
call it add to home screen

411
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,000
so actually there's uh i wouldn't show

412
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,880
you this because it's not so so simple

413
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,120
to show but there

414
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,720
there could be a little banner here that

415
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:45,279
i'm implementing

416
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:47,199
that will ask you uh to add to add

417
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:49,680
something to the home screen

418
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:50,800
uh it basically works on every platform

419
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,399
so it works on

420
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,920
uh well i will show you where it works

421
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:55,360
actually this is it so

422
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,120
on chrome it works everywhere even on

423
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,839
desktop so you can add an app

424
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,560
to the desktop on linux as well uh on

425
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,240
firefox it

426
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,839
works only on android and on safari it

427
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:06,160
was it works on ios

428
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:08,399
um and actually the biggest group of my

429
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:10,480
app users actually use ios you

430
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:11,920
use iphones this is pretty interesting

431
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,560
because i suppose the android app is

432
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,680
good enough

433
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:16,719
so everybody is sticking with the

434
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:18,560
android app the the native one

435
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,399
but ios users seem to seem to like my

436
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:24,959
app that's cool

437
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:30,160
uh it's a little demo very quickly

438
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:33,680
so yeah so basically

439
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:35,439
yeah i have i have wet hands sorry so

440
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,719
so yeah so the home screen basically

441
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:39,120
will add something like this to my

442
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:43,040
screen if i if i click it right and then

443
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:43,040
it will start behaving like a normal app

444
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:48,079
so um so yeah it's actually i'm actually

445
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,519
fully offline right so so it's actually

446
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:51,120
passing the schedule because it's pretty

447
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:54,160
big i should probably optimize it a bit

448
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,800
so the app fully works right uh i can

449
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,959
add my

450
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:59,120
uh my bookmarks even and they will stay

451
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:59,760
online offline in my device and they

452
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,920
will they'll say that

453
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:03,760
they will synchronize the way i do it i

454
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,079
use a proprietary software sorry for

455
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,160
that

456
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:07,839
i use firebase i i could actually

457
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:09,600
implement it with with another one with

458
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:10,639
paste but i haven't had time yet to do

459
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,399
it

460
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:14,000
so yeah so so this is how it's how it

461
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:14,959
looks so it looks pretty native right it

462
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,560
looks pretty like

463
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:20,638
like a native app uh yeah

464
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:22,800
you know it stays it stays as an up i

465
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:25,120
can i can switch to it

466
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:27,439
etc okay how much time we have four

467
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,639
minutes so the last yeah sorry yes

468
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,079
ten minutes left oh great because yeah

469
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:30,720
there's also five minutes for questions

470
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:33,040
yeah cool

471
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,160
i will try to leave some some some room

472
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,519
for questions because i'm very

473
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,719
interested so if you have some questions

474
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:37,759
feedback about the app i'm really

475
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:41,360
interested

476
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:43,680
uh okay and what is also cool well what

477
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:45,120
is also important is actually we need to

478
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:47,439
we need to update those those

479
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:49,360
progressive some sometimes

480
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,040
so here is actually another yeah sorry

481
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,320
it's not very visible so so it says new

482
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:54,079
version is available

483
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,519
and i can click refresh so basically

484
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:57,040
what happens with the with the service

485
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:58,560
worker is that if the service worker

486
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,920
detects a new version

487
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:02,239
it downloads itself but it doesn't

488
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:04,319
activate itself it will activate itself

489
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:06,240
next time i visit the site

490
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:07,360
so what i can do i can detect this

491
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,279
information there's new version

492
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:11,360
available and show a message to the user

493
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:13,120
oh there's a new version refresh all

494
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:15,759
right if you want to refresh immediately

495
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,160
so actually this is pretty cool i i saw

496
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:18,959
some

497
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:19,680
some discussion yesterday on the on the

498
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:21,518
fosdem

499
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:23,279
main english that there could be some

500
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:24,320
issue with the native one of the native

501
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:27,360
mobile apps because

502
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:29,279
um because something has that the room

503
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,639
names don't match exactly to what's

504
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:33,600
encoded in the app

505
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:34,079
and it's difficult to update a mobile

506
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,440
app

507
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:39,199
the native app a day before conference

508
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,880
because even if you do it even if you

509
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:41,920
release a new version users will not

510
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:44,800
download it

511
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:46,160
and here i can i can make a you know new

512
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,599
change and you would immediately see

513
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,719
this five minutes later with the

514
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,320
continuous integration it will

515
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,000
automatically pop up

516
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,440
so actually it behaves like a web app

517
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,680
like like um

518
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,959
like a website yeah so there is no

519
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,638
problem of versioning there is no

520
00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:00,239
problem of this is a big selling point

521
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:02,079
of progressive web apps

522
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:04,240
so they are always up to date always

523
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:06,639
fresh yeah

524
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:08,160
uh so this is yeah so for example that's

525
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,079
why this is one of the use cases for

526
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:12,000
progressive web apps from enough

527
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:13,599
conference apps so the stuff that

528
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,520
changes quickly that you need to maybe

529
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:17,119
adapt very quickly or

530
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,720
or that you use only for a few days and

531
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:20,000
then forget right so i don't need to

532
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:22,160
install anything

533
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,520
uh native in my on my phone i just i

534
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:26,400
just install a little

535
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:27,918
web app or even not install if i prefer

536
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,799
if i can prefer i can add it to my home

537
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:31,360
screen if i prefer

538
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:32,000
i can i can just use it as a website

539
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:36,320
this is pretty

540
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:38,559
cool uh yes and the next subject off

541
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:40,799
yeah sorry the orders didn't work so

542
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:42,399
yeah actually my little nokia is here

543
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:44,320
i will try to switch it on i it's

544
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,000
actually the battery is actually dead

545
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,360
so oh yeah it's starting up so actually

546
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,480
this is the evolution of the of the

547
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,000
design of the

548
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:52,480
of the interface i wouldn't show you the

549
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,720
intermediate step so actually the the

550
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,720
serner app is a descendant of an old app

551
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,400
for nokia 900 that i discovered couple

552
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,919
of years i still have the nokia

553
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,360
i still sometimes use it so actually and

554
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:02,080
the first progressive error that i

555
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,918
developed

556
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:05,600
was actually based on this interface was

557
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:08,160
very similar to this one

558
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:10,080
and then i i collaborated with the

559
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,679
designer

560
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:14,480
and i really suggest you to do it

561
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:16,160
because especially for mobile devices

562
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,720
the user experience is very important we

563
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:20,640
have a very

564
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:22,640
limited screen space right we have uh

565
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,840
well there are normal people out there i

566
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,440
mean i know fosdem is a

567
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:27,520
bit special so yeah you would accept

568
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,200
interface like this but

569
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,799
but normal like what those colors mean

570
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,880
what does it do

571
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:34,320
but yeah definitely normal users prefer

572
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:38,400
much more prefer something

573
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:38,399
something more something more beautiful

574
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:44,000
yes i definitely recommend you that look

575
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,120
into the design and actually that's what

576
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,120
differentiates your

577
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,479
like can i say product your projects

578
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:50,479
right so often

579
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:52,320
i mean often we forget about this aspect

580
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:55,600
it's really important

581
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:56,320
uh one thing one important mention i

582
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:59,520
wanted to

583
00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:01,918
to make is that um if you know about

584
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:03,360
a bit about the well about the front end

585
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:04,880
right so um

586
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:07,199
there are there are design systems there

587
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:09,440
is this idea to

588
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,559
to for example follow google guidelines

589
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,240
that are that are

590
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:14,000
google created material design and apple

591
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,200
for example has human enterprise

592
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,600
guidelines and there's

593
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:19,120
another thing from from microsoft so the

594
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,760
question is if i develop a progressive

595
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:22,080
web

596
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:23,280
what should i do right the progressive

597
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:25,760
error can work anywhere

598
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:27,200
we'll work on safari on our iphone we'll

599
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:30,000
work on my android

600
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:31,039
work on the desktop what do i do which

601
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,600
interface which

602
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:35,520
standards do i adapt and that's it

603
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:37,039
that's a very good question actually yes

604
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,080
you could implement different interfaces

605
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:39,600
for different devices

606
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,520
but that's a mess that's that's like a

607
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,639
direction going to the native apps right

608
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,000
this is the same direction that

609
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,360
developing separate app for each

610
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,400
platform

611
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:50,559
well if you want really good experience

612
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,720
uh then then yes perhaps you you could

613
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:54,960
do it but what i really recommend you

614
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:57,360
uh to do is actually develop your own

615
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,559
style develop your own identity visual

616
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,639
identity

617
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:02,000
and try to follow it so actually the

618
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,600
more you diverge

619
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,200
from the standard material design or

620
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,639
something the better it will look

621
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,200
because it will be yours right it will

622
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,360
be

623
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:11,520
yours or your company right obviously we

624
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:14,479
live in the in a commercial context too

625
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:16,158
so so actually good idea for me is try

626
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,120
to create to diverge to create something

627
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:19,120
different

628
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:21,678
not try to replicate exactly the

629
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:24,799
standard interface guidelines from from

630
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:26,159
from anyone uh so

631
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:28,639
that's like i think it's an interesting

632
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:29,679
advice uh to try to yeah to make it

633
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:32,799
different because the more

634
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:34,159
it's similar but because the it will

635
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:35,440
look like material design but it's

636
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:37,760
slightly different it's called

637
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:38,720
uncanny valley right it's it looks

638
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,320
slightly different

639
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,919
so it feels wrong so it's better to make

640
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:44,720
it completely different and then

641
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:46,240
then it feels right so i didn't

642
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:48,080
completely achieve it i'm actually

643
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:51,840
basing my design on material design but

644
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:54,399
but pretty much modified uh yeah

645
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:55,520
so okay so just to finish okay we are

646
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,960
running out of time so

647
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,720
our progressive apps is ready to okay

648
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:01,200
take over the words

649
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:03,120
the answer is it depends there are some

650
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:05,679
use cases that are they are much better

651
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:08,719
in i think conference is a good example

652
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:10,080
uh i think progressive apps give us more

653
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,679
power as a front-end developer if you're

654
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:14,158
a front-end developer give us more

655
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:15,200
it's just a continuation of the of the

656
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:17,280
of the more uh

657
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:19,520
features to the front end and i see them

658
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:21,360
also as a descendant of stuff like um

659
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,158
like firefox os i was a big fan of this

660
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:25,439
one

661
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:26,640
uh and you know the the idea to to make

662
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:29,200
to write apps

663
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,320
in web technologies so i i find it

664
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,720
interesting

665
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:34,559
in relation to free open source i think

666
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,280
you know progressive apps could be a

667
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:38,559
step

668
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:42,399
to break the the android versus

669
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:44,240
ios duopoly because if at some point

670
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,520
all your apps all your important apps

671
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,880
are are web apps

672
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:48,799
then you don't you don't care which

673
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:51,200
device you use right it's like

674
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:52,879
for me for linux it's i can i can many

675
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,240
users i can just propose linux because

676
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:56,000
most of the stuff

677
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,440
they use on the web right the most of

678
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,440
the apps they use on the web

679
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:00,720
so i think if we can get more

680
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:03,120
progressive web apps

681
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,080
then then perhaps it will be easier to

682
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:06,639
switch between

683
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:08,240
android ios and maybe some some free

684
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:10,640
open source system

685
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:12,640
uh that that that will emerge right

686
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:14,400
there will be no

687
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:16,000
friction friction will be lower right to

688
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,679
switch because if i lose all my apps if

689
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,440
i switch the operating system it sucks

690
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:21,360
so obviously there are use cases for

691
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,960
native apps so so i'm not telling you to

692
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:24,840
only use progressive apps but

693
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:27,280
it's developing it's an interesting

694
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:28,639
technology

695
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:31,280
okay that's what i wanted to say thank

696
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,280
you very much

697
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:36,399
so so if you have any questions or

698
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,960
feedback

699
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:39,760
yeah please shoot now or later if you

700
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:42,799
have time

701
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:42,799
do you have some questions

702
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:48,960
hi there are a couple of difference

703
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:52,480
between a native

704
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:54,000
application and pwa such as speed and

705
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:57,120
removing cash how to solve

706
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,320
it you mean yeah

707
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:01,039
there will be i mean if you want to

708
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:02,639
write an an ar vr app for example they

709
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:03,360
even started for this right but if you

710
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,280
if you try to

711
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:06,399
do something that is that requires

712
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:08,639
native power

713
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:10,559
or write a game i would stick to the

714
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:12,320
native apps unfortunately right

715
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:13,760
so far but you know the web is

716
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:15,280
progressing like we just saw you can

717
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,320
what you can do with javascript right

718
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,520
you can you can write games in

719
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:19,520
javascript too so

720
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:21,360
basically it's just uh it's just a web

721
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:24,960
app yeah so

722
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:25,918
well they're they're ready they're

723
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:28,640
getting ready

724
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:29,840
yeah but yeah they will not i think you

725
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,400
know this is a wrong distinction

726
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,959
actually i have

727
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,520
i have a text here saying why

728
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,120
progressive

729
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:36,720
versus native is the wrong question to

730
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:38,559
ask let's not

731
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:40,400
i wouldn't ask this question i think

732
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:43,440
let's use the best tool for the

733
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:45,279
task cheers and

734
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,480
do you use web sockets behind

735
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:48,840
notifications or

736
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:51,600
just like querying all the time the

737
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:52,320
server no no the the notifications

738
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,959
actually is

739
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:56,480
um is a mechanism built into the service

740
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,400
worker so

741
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:59,760
so the service worker knows that the new

742
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,440
version is available

743
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:03,600
and it will send something in my in my

744
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:05,760
so it's all happening in the front end

745
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,879
okay but make it http request to check

746
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:10,960
if the innovation is available

747
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:14,559
so we query all the time uh

748
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:14,960
wait uh is it a websocket client behind

749
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:17,520
or just

750
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,000
no it's not web socket but if you if you

751
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:20,960
ask about

752
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,240
the the the schedule yes actually it's

753
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,600
pulling it's pulling every

754
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:25,279
every minute but actually it's not

755
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:27,120
downloading the whole thing

756
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:28,480
because it's checking the the e-tag you

757
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:31,120
know the the last modifier

758
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:32,400
okay okay yeah yeah so it's checking the

759
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:34,080
header right i

760
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,679
i send the checksum oh it's modified

761
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:38,240
okay i don't know the whole thing

762
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:39,760
so it's not i think it will be better if

763
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:41,679
you use websocket client

764
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:43,039
just subscribe for changes and server

765
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:44,720
will notify you about

766
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:46,400
each you are right i was thinking about

767
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:48,159
something even even better right i

768
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,679
actually using firebase as i said if you

769
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:50,799
know this technology right so i can put

770
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:51,520
the whole schedule in firebase and

771
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:53,039
firebase well

772
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:54,879
it's a real-time database so push me the

773
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:56,400
update okay but i wanted to increase the

774
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:58,080
dependency on google so that's why i

775
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,760
keep it minimal only to

776
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:01,439
firebase is actually used for for a

777
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,799
bookmarks to actually synchronize them

778
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,480
between devices because if i

779
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:06,320
i can actually log in in this app i

780
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,840
didn't show you that i can log in and

781
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:09,360
then i can have my bookmarks between all

782
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,559
the devices the same like i will show it

783
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:13,120
very quickly

784
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:14,158
it's okay it doesn't answer a question

785
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:16,799
yeah

786
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:16,799
try my best

787
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:28,240
yes so there are very good resources

788
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,279
about this i didn't include them in the

789
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:31,679
in the talk

790
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:32,880
but yeah uh it's approaching so actually

791
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:35,440
you have notifications you have

792
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:37,840
geolocation you have camera

793
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:39,440
uh you cannot you cannot ask bluetooth

794
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:42,158
as far as i know for example from the

795
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:43,279
web yet right so obviously there will be

796
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:45,200
things that you couldn't do

797
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:47,440
and uh it's it's like a website

798
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:49,520
basically all right but as usual it

799
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:52,159
keeps surprising me how much you can do

800
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:54,158
and it's each next year right but it's

801
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:56,480
really evolving like last two years ago

802
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:57,200
there wasn't at the home screen on ios

803
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:00,159
uh

804
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:02,080
in 2019 or 2018 made it was added you

805
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:05,279
know it's it's evolving very quickly

806
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:05,279
so yeah yeah

807
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:13,199
yeah so just very very quickly i can

808
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:16,320
actually log in right

809
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:18,240
i cannot do my oh it's not here

810
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:19,439
yeah so i can actually log into this app

811
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:21,279
and then synchronize

812
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:22,720
bookmarks between devices okay i think

813
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:24,960
we run into this

814
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:26,080
are there any specific frameworks that

815
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:28,480
make it easy to

816
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:30,158
write progressive web apps yeah good

817
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,919
question i use workbox

818
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:33,279
that's the that's the library very

819
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:36,400
popular one

820
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:40,480
uh sorry yeah sorry it's so me

821
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:40,480
in terms of technology i use vue.js here

822
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:43,678
but yeah the library that actually

823
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,640
enables progressive apps is called

824
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:46,960
workbox

825
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,960
sorry

826
00:26:49,279 --> 00:27:00,480
okay thank you thank you thank you
