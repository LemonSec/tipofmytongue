thank you for attending this meeting i'm

00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:13,599
from the open technology assembly which

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:15,679
is a non-profit organization

5
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:17,920

here

7
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:23,278
so the topic of this talk will be the

8
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:27,519
open source support program

9
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:27,519
that we will be announcing today

10
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:34,640
so the mission is as you can read

11
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:36,800
is to support open source software

12
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,760
and any kind of open source solution

13
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,519
project

14
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:44,640
doesn't have to be software only can

15
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:47,680
also be hardware

16
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:50,640
before we go in details uh on

17
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:51,680
what we will do and how we will do it uh

18
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,320
how we would like

19
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:56,000
you to do it let's talk a bit about the

20
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,399
open source

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,719
uh and the open technology assembly

22
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:04,400
non-profit organization which we are

23
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:05,360
where that we came from we came from the

24
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,640
belgian unix

25
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:10,960
users group and this was founded in the

26
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,439
last century in 87

27
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:15,520
so very long time ago as you can see on

28
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:17,119
my grade here

29
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:20,000
go a long time already in that

30
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:23,920
organization um i think one of the

31
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,159
most uh points that we realized in

32
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,360
in belgium at least is that you started

33
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,840
the internet

34
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,680
that was uh together with the university

35
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:35,119
of leuven

36
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:38,640
and then further on it went into

37
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:40,320
a net it was a profit organization for

38
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,240
commercial organization afterwards it

39
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,839
was a bit solved

40
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,720
and from that we got a lot of money

41
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:49,040
effect by doing that

42
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:51,439
but belgium unix uses group did more

43
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:54,640
than internet only we also promoted

44
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:57,758
the unixes in the last century

45
00:01:54,640 --> 00:02:01,200
xlx says sunos

46
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:03,840
solaris afterwards hpax ultrix all the

47
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,759
unixes that were around and were all

48
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,959
different flavors and we

49
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:10,160
held meetings conferences to meet people

50
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:15,520
to organize

51
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:15,520
a lot of talks about it and one of the

52
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,280
steps that we did afterwards was the

53
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,120
fact

54
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,640
to promote open source software

55
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,680
something was created

56
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:28,000
called linux it was in 91

57
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,360
and we jumped on the dragon very early

58
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
to organize

59
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,519
linux meetings and to promote that

60
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,599
effect and also promoting the open

61
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:37,840
source

62
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:39,119
you can see it in this diagram this is a

63
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,280
bit the history of the

64
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,200
belgian units group and the open

65
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:46,239
technology assembly

66
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:49,839
as you can see founded in 87

67
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:51,360
and from 92 to 2003 we did a lot of

68
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,680
linux

69
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,959
sikh meetings uh special interest group

70
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,040
meetings

71
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:59,280
and that was typically on a saturday

72
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:01,040
morning a couple of hours that we did a

73
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,040
lot of

74
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,319
talk about topics which were very brand

75
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,879
new

76
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:08,079
sent mail all these kind of topics that

77
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:09,679
are very hot in the

78
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,760
beginning of the 90s that we have

79
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:14,239
speaking it's very long time ago already

80
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,239
but okay

81
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:19,120
and another thing was because as you

82
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,159
know internet now

83
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,200
you have a very big pipeline to download

84
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:24,959
everything what you like

85
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,879
in a few seconds there we are speaking

86
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:28,640
but back in the beginning of the 90s

87
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:31,280
that was not the case

88
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,760
and the internet was just starting up

89
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,680
and

90
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,959
i still remember that i used the

91
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:38,159
internet within an

92
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:40,319
x25 modem does somebody still know the

93
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:43,359
protocol x25

94
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:47,040
okay still one very good

95
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:49,519
so as you see internet evolved a lot

96
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,280
but at that time yeah the the pipelines

97
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:54,640
were not there and we delivered the fact

98
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:56,080
the linux system on cd-roms it was a big

99
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:58,238
hit effect because it was

100
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:00,000
very loved by the people and by the

101
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:01,840
members of the belgian united studios

102
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,040
group and afterwards the open technology

103
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,879
assembly

104
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:08,400
that's passed away in 98 i think that

105
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:09,920
was the last time that we

106
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,519
created to see the rounds because at

107
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:14,720
that time the internet

108
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:17,840
got more and more uh used and

109
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:21,519
also the download was uh it was

110
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:23,679
less needed effect in 96

111
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:26,160
also we renamed the belgian unix users

112
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:28,800
group to the open technology assembly

113
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,240
and because we were more and more going

114
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,320
towards the open source

115
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,080
and to promote open source projects and

116
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,759
stuff like that and also the meetings

117
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,479
and the conferences that we did at that

118
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,800
time

119
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:41,280
where and we thought the open technology

120
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:44,479
assembly is a good name

121
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:47,520
but i will learn but of course

122
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:48,639
in the 20 well afterwards like say that

123
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:52,240
uh

124
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:54,800
beginning the 2000s 2010

125
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,479
there was less interest in conferences

126
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,360
around linux because yeah the internet

127
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:59,520
was

128
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,039
yeah everything was there you could just

129
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:05,120
download find everything

130
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:07,919
so we did not do any conferences anymore

131
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:10,240
and that was all just last year that we

132
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:12,560
decided yeah we have still

133
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,919
money left from the old times from the

134
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:17,039
internet effect

135
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:18,479
that we started up i said let's do

136
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:22,000
something with it

137
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:23,599
and find open source projects and so

138
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,120
and that is the goal of this stark

139
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,880
effect

140
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,280
so now you know the history a bit where

141
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:31,440
we came from

142
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,799
that's uh one of the pictures that i

143
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:36,080
just took about the

144
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:38,639
sea drones that we created was

145
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:40,880
i think the best seed drum there were

146
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,759
two seed drums that were very uh lovely

147
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,479
that's one that

148
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,440
contained the the uh museum of the red

149
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:47,680
louver

150
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,440
that was a kind of contest that i did

151
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,479
with the guys from the louvre itself

152
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,880
that said okay

153
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:53,520
if you can copy it on the cd it's it's

154
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,680
okay

155
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:57,680
and we did it i took a lot of time for

156
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:00,160
it and i wrote a kind of lint

157
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:02,000
program to to find all the interlinks

158
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,440
that were working on the c drum

159
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,120
so you could just browse to see the

160
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:07,039
round through the complete louvre

161
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,479
and that was one of the cd-roms effect

162
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:11,280
was a fun project

163
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:13,680
and another one was the linux 95 which

164
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:17,039
came out before windows 95 by the way

165
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,639
that's yes okay that's that's big

166
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:21,360
history but

167
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:22,400
still have the sea drops so what's next

168
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,560
and because you're now

169
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,159
here for the next topic effect it's the

170
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:30,240
open source

171
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:33,520
support program okay what is the goal

172
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,560
the goal is as you can read on the left

173
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:37,599
side

174
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:40,880
is that we would like to sponsor

175
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:43,919
people and projects around open source

176
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:48,560
can be hardware can be software can be

177
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:50,719
even conferences or lectures like that

178
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,400
and even pay for hosting that's also a

179
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,840
possibility if you say we have a project

180
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,560
but i don't have the money to host

181
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:57,599
something

182
00:06:54,560 --> 00:07:01,039
okay we can provide you with a

183
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:02,719
cost for that if you want to do some

184
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:04,400
hardware prototyping that's also a

185
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:07,680
possibility

186
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:08,000
um and what we already did since last

187
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,759
year

188
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:14,000
is the sponsor conferences

189
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:16,080
fosdem is not sponsored by us but

190
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,240
tomorrow there is a conference in ghent

191
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,840
the country conference management camp

192
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,479
we are one of the sponsors

193
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,520
and we did last year also some other

194
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:26,639
little conferences

195
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:28,080
around linux and open source in general

196
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:29,840
in fact

197
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,440
so it should be community based that's

198
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:33,919
clear it's it's not

199
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:35,199
we don't will not suppose any anything

200
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:37,280
about closed software

201
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:38,800
uh it should be open source and if you

202
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:41,198
create something

203
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:43,199
fine we would love to sponsor you about

204
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:44,400
it but it would be even nicer that for

205
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:46,720
example next year

206
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,520
you gave a lightening talk about it here

207
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,639
why not

208
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:53,039
so that we can at least see okay

209
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:55,280
somewhat we did something useful with it

210
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:57,120
and then we are very glad to uh to be

211
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:59,119
part of that

212
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,240
so everything that we gave away now

213
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,960
should return

214
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,759
to the community so that's uh one of the

215
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:06,878
fundamental

216
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:10,479
ideas important

217
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:13,520
we will never pay for people we will not

218
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:15,520
pay labor hours we will not

219
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,719
pay you for any following any training

220
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:19,840
of course

221
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:23,440
of education and commercial programs are

222
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,440
out of the question okay

223
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:30,799
that's the fundamental ideas

224
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:35,519
and this is the most important url

225
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:38,399
for your submitting your proposals

226
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:39,200
the we have a special website that will

227
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,839
be

228
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,399
uh published right now it is published

229
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:46,000
against

230
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:48,240
me so if you have a proposal

231
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,760
this is the place to be you can submit

232
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,680
it

233
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:53,360
and this is the process and there there

234
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,079
are two things that we would like to

235
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:57,440
find

236
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,880
we would like to find members members to

237
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:01,440
to be a jury

238
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:02,640
to uh to guide people who submit

239
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,279
something

240
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,760
to say okay this is okay this is not

241
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,480
okay

242
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:09,680
you should go in that direction and then

243
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,920
it should be an open

244
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:14,239
community it's such this if you submit

245
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:17,279
something a proposal

246
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,880
it should be open and in the clear

247
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:20,959
why it is accepted why is it not

248
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:23,519
accepted for example what is missing

249
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:25,199
and stuff like that so you need two two

250
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:26,880
full people we need projects of course

251
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:30,560
we need also people

252
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:33,120
who act together with us as a jury

253
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:34,959
that's also interesting i would say but

254
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,320
the process is the same you should just

255
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:39,119
submit a proposal

256
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:41,440
an issue at hitchhike and somebody from

257
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:44,560
the other members will own the issue

258
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:46,720
and then it is an open discussion and

259
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,239
well at the board meetings probably we

260
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,760
will decide

261
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,440
how we will do the funding and stuff

262
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:53,680
like that so we're

263
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,920
just starting up so don't expect that we

264
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:58,640
can give you all the answers today

265
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,040
that we are working on it and one of the

266
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,720
things

267
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:05,760
is i will show you the website

268
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:09,519
should be online

269
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:11,839
let's refresh it and here is the website

270
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:13,440
it was just released by young or

271
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:15,600
president

272
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,200
and you can just see here if you scroll

273
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,360
by what the

274
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:22,399
bit of the history is there where we

275
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:25,519
came from dc drums history is there

276
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:26,079
um well it's just the initial start of

277
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:29,200
the

278
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:32,319
the website uh more to follow of course

279
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:36,640
but the most important thing is of is

280
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:39,839
the fending the hota let's see

281
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:41,839
here is the proposals if you have

282
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:46,079
something you can submit it over there

283
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:47,839
and from there we can start i think

284
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:50,399
in general i've discussed everything

285
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:52,480
what's required for this talk

286
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:54,480
uh still have some time left for

287
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:58,839
questions if there are any questions

288
00:10:54,480 --> 00:11:00,800
please come forward i will try to answer

289
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:04,480
it

290
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,479
any question in the back is the one

291
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,800
thanks great initiative on the website

292
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:14,880
it says

293
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,399
only for belgian not-for-profit

294
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:18,240
organizations

295
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:19,680
also the funding of hosting i mean that

296
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:23,440
might limit the

297
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:26,640
scope a bit yeah initially

298
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:31,360
we were thinking about sponsoring effect

299
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:32,640
the belgian community um but we're still

300
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,480
not hundred percent sure if it's

301
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:36,319
direction we'll we will be going

302
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,839
if there is enough interest or not

303
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,640
enough interest let's say that in

304
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:40,720
belgium

305
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:42,640
for projects we can take it outside

306
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:46,160
belgium of course

307
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:47,040
but it is a bit embellishment

308
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,120
organization

309
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:51,040
that's true and we would like to see a

310
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,639
lot of belgian projects

311
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:54,639
but yeah everything is open for

312
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:56,639
discussion of course if you have an idea

313
00:11:54,639 --> 00:12:01,040
you can submit it

314
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:01,040
okay any other questions

315
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:08,079
no i would say

316
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:10,240
if you have something you can always ask

317
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:13,040
the questions

318
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,440
towards us as an issue or it's in the

319
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:16,880
mail

320
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,279
afterwards okay i have still time left

321
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:21,120
so

322
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:21,120
if there's no still one question

323
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:25,839
probably

324
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:38,719
uh hi um i think it's a very

325
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:39,360
nice initiative i just was wondering i

326
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,959
couldn't

327
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:46,079
get all the the list um

328
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:49,920
are you planning on sponsoring um

329
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:53,439
educational events or initiatives

330
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:57,040
like the

331
00:12:53,440 --> 00:13:00,320
how is it called the the monthly code

332
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:01,599
initiative or the 100 hours of code or

333
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:04,880
something like that

334
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:08,000
that i think it's sponsored by the

335
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:11,200
european union or

336
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:14,240
some things of this for young people

337
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:15,519
well what we said in the previous slide

338
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:18,560
was that we would not

339
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:21,680
sponsor education as such for

340
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:24,719
your personal reasons uh we can support

341
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:28,160
