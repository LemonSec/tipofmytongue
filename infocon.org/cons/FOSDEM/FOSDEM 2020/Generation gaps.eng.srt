1
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:12,400
hello guys

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,280
please find a seat and then we can start

3
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,480
with the next

4
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:18,320
talk the last one for the history so the

5
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:21,359
end of history of this

6
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:24,880
for stem will be presented by

7
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:28,960
liam proven he is working with zuzer

8
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:31,359
and he's working with unix since 1988 so

9
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:34,160
he knows quite some history

10
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:35,280
and he's a technical writer so please

11
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:38,640
enjoy

12
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:41,040
generation gaps with liam proven

13
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,040
have fun

14
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:49,760
wow thank you very much

15
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:51,199
um so hello good afternoon thank you for

16
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:55,440
coming to my talk

17
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:58,480
um my plan today is to commit heresy

18
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:01,039
i want to murder some deeply loved ideas

19
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:04,080
especially some beloved of the open

20
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:06,560
source community and the unix community

21
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,320
if you're not okay with that then good

22
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,520
because you might actually you know find

23
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:13,039
it interesting

24
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:15,439
um i'm going to talk about stuff that

25
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,159
you probably already know but i will

26
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:18,639
talk about

27
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:19,840
things that you maybe don't know that

28
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,320
you know

29
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,600
there are things that we don't talk

30
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,399
about in the history

31
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:28,000
and the development of open source unix

32
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,880
software in general

33
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,360
um i'm here to tell you that these

34
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,479
things

35
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:37,439
are although true not

36
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:38,799
good things that they are toxic things

37
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:41,919
harmful things

38
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:44,320
things that are holding us back you

39
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,560
might find it all a bit difficult and

40
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:50,079
you might find it ridiculous

41
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:53,680
so i'm going to start quite slowly

42
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:55,758
you you know the cartoon before i had to

43
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:59,119
go and get a job i worked in biology

44
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:00,640
and everybody misunderstands evolution

45
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:03,360
they think that it's a progress of

46
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:05,520
getting more complicated and getting

47
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,280
better and more sophisticated and that

48
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:10,560
is not at all how

49
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,920
evolution works evolution is random and

50
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,200
chaotic and

51
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:17,920
sometimes stuff gets weird

52
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:21,760
um so computers have been around for

53
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:24,879
about 75 years now

54
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:26,879
and in that 75 years a lot of people

55
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:30,160
have spent a lot of time

56
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:33,599
arguing about generations of computers

57
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:35,359
um well i have a slightly different take

58
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:36,879
on that

59
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,560
the general belief is that each

60
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:40,079
generation of computers is better than

61
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:43,360
the generation before

62
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:47,519
that it's obviously faster that it's got

63
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:50,879
more storage it can do more

64
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:52,879
actually that's not true many times in

65
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:55,518
the history and development of computing

66
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:58,159
the new generation has been worse than

67
00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:00,640
the generation that went before

68
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:01,200
we have not always been adding new

69
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,279
features

70
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,359
adding new capabilities actually the big

71
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,120
generation transitions have been when we

72
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,040
take them away

73
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,959
when we make new computers that are

74
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,560
inferior to the computers that went

75
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:14,159
before

76
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,519
i touched on some of this a couple of

77
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,480
years ago in a talk that some of you

78
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:18,159
might have seen

79
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,399
um so i'm going to give you some

80
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:23,040
examples um

81
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:25,200
here is one of the first programmable

82
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:27,599
digital computers that's eniac it

83
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,560
was an american computer partly funded

84
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:31,920
by the

85
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:33,360
department of defense as so much was um

86
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,359
these things were huge

87
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,640
and they were very expensive because

88
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:40,080
they were hand built

89
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:42,879
out of individual valves and so on um

90
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,239
they had just one type of storage and

91
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:46,239
not very much of it just

92
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:48,400
a few dozen words in the very first

93
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:50,799
cases bytes were invented later

94
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,840
um they could only hold one program at a

95
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:54,080
time which were written

96
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,040
by hand in machine code on a piece of

97
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,879
paper and then

98
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:59,040
entered into the computer one bit at a

99
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:01,359
time so

100
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:03,280
easy to manage they got a little bit

101
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,480
bigger they got a bit more sophisticated

102
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,040
and they got more memory

103
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,798
and some very slow offline storage

104
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:12,079
things like punch tape

105
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:12,720
paper tape uh punched cards this made

106
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,599
programs

107
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,880
and data quicker to load but the

108
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:19,039
computer was still

109
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:21,199
something where the workload was managed

110
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:23,040
not by anything on the computer but by

111
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:24,639
people it was a people problem to get

112
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,759
somebody in get their software on the

113
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,520
computer run it

114
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:28,960
results printed and out as quickly as

115
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,400
possible

116
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,400
and everything was hand written in

117
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:35,599
machine code so every time you got a new

118
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:38,638
computer you had to rewrite everything

119
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:41,680
then roughly at the end of the

120
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:45,600
50s came a huge distinction

121
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:47,600
this is an ibm 701 and standing next to

122
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:50,960
it is future president ronald reagan

123
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:54,160
um the image is from ibm um

124
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:55,198
the thing about the early mainframe

125
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,960
computers

126
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:58,720
that distinguished them from the

127
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:01,120
computers that went before was not that

128
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,720
they had more storage although they did

129
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,400
it was that they had two types of

130
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,440
storage

131
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:10,400
one type was stored at first on

132
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:12,560
little tiny magnetized rings directly

133
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:16,320
mapped into the processor's address bus

134
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:17,759
now we call that ram the other type of

135
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:20,880
storage

136
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:24,160
was much bigger and much slower and

137
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:26,800
much more expensive this

138
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,560
is i believe the university college

139
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,720
london i'm not certain that is a five

140
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:33,199
megabyte hard disk being delivered

141
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,479
um if you have to ask how much it cost

142
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:38,320
you couldn't afford it

143
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:41,680
um the difference here

144
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:44,159
was two types of storage this is what

145
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:46,720
was called secondary storage

146
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,479
so some of the storage is in the

147
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,160
processor's memory bus

148
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:52,320
some of the process much more some of

149
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:55,600
the storage much more of it

150
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:57,840
is on a device like that and it's

151
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,960
accessed not by the memory bus but by a

152
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,560
controller

153
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,318
the processor has to go and say to the

154
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,479
controller right i need this block

155
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:05,680
and it the controller goes and fetches

156
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:07,520
it off the

157
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,360
huge hard disk with mechanical parts

158
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,799
moving and puts it into a block of

159
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,240
memory and you can work on it and then

160
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,199
you can write it back

161
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,919
this two-level distinction primary

162
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:17,759
storage

163
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:19,680
and secondary storage is very very

164
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:20,000
important and we don't talk about it

165
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,360
much

166
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:27,759
anymore and

167
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,759
the problem is that

168
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:31,919
it's so implicit virtually every

169
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,719
computer

170
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:36,560
in about the last 60 65 years has had

171
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,720
this split we all know it's there we've

172
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,960
taken it as red we take it as a given

173
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:42,639
that you have memory and you have discs

174
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,638
and you move stuff between them

175
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:46,080
this is absolutely built into the

176
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:49,840
structure of virtually

177
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,840
all software in the world today

178
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,720
it enabled a whole new generation of

179
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,880
technology it enabled things like

180
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,560
compilers where you have one program

181
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,800
that reads another program

182
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:03,039
does something to it to produce a third

183
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:07,680
program that you can run

184
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:09,520
that created cobol and fortran and

185
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,120
made a market for computers very much

186
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:13,280
bigger this

187
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,880
the stretch pioneering machine a

188
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,799
complete commercial failure

189
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:19,039
first super scalar computer the first

190
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:21,440
computer with eight bit bytes

191
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:22,880
the first computer with pipelining

192
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,880
remarkable machine

193
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:28,560
they sold about six of them for roughly

194
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,560
half the cost of building it

195
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:33,039
but again once you've got compilers

196
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:35,840
you've got high-level languages you

197
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:38,240
rewrite everything all over again

198
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,440
then the next leap was not really a

199
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,840
technical leap

200
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,360
the next leap was a commercial leap it

201
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:47,520
was a marketing leap

202
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:50,240
again ibm invention at the time

203
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,960
early 60s ibm sold multiple ranges of

204
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,879
computers

205
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:55,280
they sold things like the 701 and the

206
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:56,879
1401 and the 60 30.

207
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,559
all totally different different number

208
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:00,000
of bits per word

209
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,199
different operating systems different

210
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,560
programming languages totally

211
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:05,919
incompatible

212
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:09,199
ibm had a very clever idea in the 60s

213
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:12,000
and they invented the ibm system 360.

214
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:13,120
this is the smallest model of ibm system

215
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,520
360.

216
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:17,440
this is basically a single user personal

217
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,400
computer that can just barely struggle

218
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,919
through one programming

219
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:24,159
language at a time the

220
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:25,680
idea of system 360 was they could sell a

221
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,840
whole range of different computers and

222
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,440
they could all run the same software

223
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,119
not the same operating system they

224
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,840
offered lots of different operating

225
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:35,200
systems for

226
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:38,079
the s 360. it was a huge success

227
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,279
it made them a great deal of money they

228
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:42,080
continued to add

229
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:44,159
and enhance the system 360 for years it

230
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:46,640
became the system 370

231
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:48,959
and now it's called z series and the

232
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,560
direct descendant of this computer

233
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:52,959
if you bought an air ticket like me to

234
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,640
come to fosdem your ticket was booked

235
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:56,399
through the descendant of that computer

236
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:58,560
running compatible software

237
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:00,000
if you paid for it with a credit card

238
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,680
your money went through a bank account

239
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,160
that was controlled by the offspring of

240
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:07,359
one of these

241
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:10,480
again it's like evolution

242
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:12,160
we complex multicellular mammals

243
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,920
evolved from simpler organisms which

244
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,760
ultimately evolved from bacteria

245
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,439
the bacteria are still there underneath

246
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:19,200
there's more of them than us there are

247
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,399
more species of them than us there is

248
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,760
more of them by mass

249
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:24,000
there's more of them by individuals it

250
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:26,720
doesn't go away nothing goes away

251
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,959
but what's interesting about these is

252
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:32,640
they contributed very little

253
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:34,479
to the next generation of computers

254
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:36,880
because the next generation of computers

255
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:39,440
suddenly started to get smaller

256
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:42,240
and cheaper because of transistors

257
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:44,959
because of integrated circuits

258
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,560
this the first machine units was written

259
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,119
on this is a pdp-7 it might have been

260
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:51,599
even the

261
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:54,480
the same one in the slide earlier

262
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:56,880
this only cost 72 000 pounds sorry

263
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,880
dollars

264
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:02,160
a department could afford to buy one of

265
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:04,320
these they were shared at most by just a

266
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:06,319
few people as opposed to a mainframe

267
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:09,760
which occupied a floor of a building and

268
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:14,000
was shared by an entire company

269
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:17,680
this was in virtually every way

270
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:20,560
worse than a mainframe they were

271
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:21,359
smaller they were stupider they were

272
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,518
slower

273
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,040
they had less memory they had fewer

274
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:27,440
instructions

275
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,319
mainframes had wonderful fancy smart

276
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:31,279
terminals

277
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,839
where the software on the terminal could

278
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:33,760
collect

279
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:36,160
information from the user filling in a

280
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:37,920
form and validate it and package it up

281
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,600
and send it over network to the

282
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,680
mainframe these

283
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:44,240
had a printer with a keyboard on the end

284
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:47,120
of a serial line

285
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:49,200
mainframes had fantastic fast clever

286
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,680
storage controllers which could search

287
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:53,200
and sort and index all their own data

288
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,959
and the mainframe could just send it an

289
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,880
instruction that said find me

290
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:58,000
all the people whose surname matches

291
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:01,360
brown

292
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,279
and it just happened they used

293
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,560
a technology called query language for

294
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:04,880
this there's one you've probably heard

295
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,359
of

296
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:09,120
sql sql structured query language

297
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,720
originally from ibm

298
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,320
didn't get anything like that on these

299
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:15,839
they had to manage their own disks

300
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,839
manage their own blocks

301
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:20,560
but they caught on they sold really well

302
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,680
just a year later this was a smaller

303
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:24,399
model

304
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,599
only eighteen thousand dollars hundred

305
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:29,040
and fifty thousand

306
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:31,600
today approximately they

307
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,399
got cheap enough that now the computer

308
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,600
could sit

309
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:38,959
and wait for humans to input information

310
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:42,160
this meant interactive software this

311
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:44,640
meant all kinds of cool stuff like

312
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:46,319
text editors from the mainframe you

313
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,760
edited your text and punched it into a

314
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,800
card and no computer needed to be

315
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:51,120
involved

316
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,479
these smaller cheaper but worse

317
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:56,639
computers

318
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:57,760
enabled a huge burst of creativity

319
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:59,839
now i'm going to do something a little

320
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,720
bit better i would really like everybody

321
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:03,200
to go and watch

322
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,160
this presentation the future of

323
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,560
programming

324
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:08,079
and as you can see from the slide dbx

325
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:11,599
conference july the 9th

326
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:14,439
1973 dbx's dropbox

327
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,839
um he wasn't really presenting it in

328
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:18,800
1973

329
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:19,760
he presented it 40 years later but he

330
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,680
dressed in a

331
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:24,639
70s outfit complete with a pocket

332
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:27,839
protector and he presented from

333
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:31,120
acetate slides put on an ohp

334
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:32,880
it's a wonderful period piece because he

335
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,639
talks about

336
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:36,399
what the next 40 years of software would

337
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:39,839
develop

338
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:39,839
and none of it happened

339
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:45,839
you would be amazed at what was invented

340
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:49,839
on these kind of computers

341
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:51,839
at the time on big clunky mini computers

342
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:53,600
they invented you've probably seen the

343
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:54,880
doug engelbart famous mother of all

344
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,240
demos

345
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:58,480
if you haven't you should really see

346
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:01,519
that video conferencing

347
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:03,920
live video streams multimedia

348
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:05,519
shared interactive workspaces in the

349
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:08,719
sixties

350
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:12,000
invented on many computers

351
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:16,320
there was a huge variety of them dead

352
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,519
for example the pdp-7 was an 18-bit mini

353
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:20,000
computer

354
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:21,680
but the pdp-11 which was the next

355
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,800
machine they ported unix to

356
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:25,839
was a 16-bit mini computer deck also

357
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:29,920
offered 12-bit

358
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:31,680
and 36-bit machines at the same time

359
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:33,599
and they all ran multiple different

360
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:36,719
operating systems as well

361
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:38,000
so this kind of stuff means that

362
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,600
there were lots of obsolete operating

363
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,920
systems you've probably never heard of

364
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,199
so

365
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:46,399
for example um the dec

366
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:49,439
pdp 8 ran an operating system called

367
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:51,120
os 8. it very cleverly managed to encode

368
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:54,959
file names into i think

369
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:57,199
four words and the result was

370
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:58,719
that the file name had a six character

371
00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:00,639
name followed by a dot followed by a

372
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,959
three character extension

373
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:04,959
i bet everybody here has computer files

374
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:07,599
called jpg

375
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:09,439
when it actually stands for jpeg jpeg i

376
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:12,880
bet you've all dealt with files called

377
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:15,440
htm instead of html why

378
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:16,320
because of os 8 running on an rs are

379
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:19,519
running on a deck

380
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:23,120
rt sorry running on the deck pdp8

381
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:26,000
the pdp8 also influenced a later machine

382
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:28,639
from deck called a p2p 11 which ran a

383
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,480
different operating system called rt11

384
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:33,120
it expanded the file names very slightly

385
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:35,920
to 8.3

386
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,560
it also invented commands like copy and

387
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:40,160
era

388
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:41,920
and dell and so on dir

389
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:44,240
this stuff is all pervasive in your

390
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:46,560
computers now the 32-bit successor to

391
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:49,839
the pdp-11 was the vax

392
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:51,359
programs on avax are called exe sound

393
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:53,279
vaguely familiar

394
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:55,279
these are all long gone they're all long

395
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:59,839
dead but their influence is still deeply

396
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:59,839
rooted in everything we run today

397
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,160
one thing that did come out of those

398
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:06,800
machines was

399
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:07,600
the idea flowed back up the price chain

400
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,079
to

401
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,920
interactivity ibm found it really

402
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:14,000
difficult to do interactivity in their

403
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,959
big mainframe operating systems

404
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,600
in the end they come up with a

405
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:18,399
workaround they wrote operating systems

406
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:21,519
that could run

407
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:24,000
under other operating systems so each

408
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:24,720
user of the big multitasking mainframe

409
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,639
had

410
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,839
their own single user operating system

411
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:29,680
talking to their terminal

412
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:31,360
all multitasking on a totally different

413
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:33,599
unrelated operating system

414
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:35,120
it's a hypervisor it's one of the very

415
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,560
few things to make it from mainframes

416
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:39,839
into many computers and into

417
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:41,518
computers today because many computers

418
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:42,720
got swept away by the descendants of

419
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:46,000
this

420
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:48,560
this was a five thousand dollar terminal

421
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,320
with two kilobytes of ram but it could

422
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,599
actually run its own software

423
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,680
the company that built it gave a

424
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,079
commission to a small california company

425
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:57,279
called

426
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:58,880
intel to design them a single chip intel

427
00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:00,639
failed they couldn't deliver on time so

428
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,920
this machine had its

429
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:04,399
processor built out of discrete

430
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:06,800
components but intel did finish that

431
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:08,399
chip and it became the intel 4004 which

432
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,800
was upgraded to the 808

433
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:11,920
which became the 8080 which became the

434
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,680
808

435
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:16,000
which is you know the ancestor of what

436
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:19,199
i'm presenting from

437
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:21,199
so two big shifts around the turning

438
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:23,120
point from the 60s to the 70s the

439
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:25,040
computer revolution you all know about

440
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:29,040
that there's another one

441
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:32,399
that you might not have met

442
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:33,759
so the first micro computers

443
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:35,920
this was the one that started the

444
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:36,880
microsoft business empire this is amits

445
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:38,959
altair

446
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:41,360
it ran microsoft basic their first ever

447
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:41,359
program

448
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:47,120
it's composed of separate cards

449
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,240
you could buy it as a kit or you could

450
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,519
buy it ready made

451
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,040
but there's a separate card for the

452
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:53,040
processor a separate card for the memory

453
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:55,120
a separate card for the disk controller

454
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:56,639
and although you could flick switches on

455
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:59,440
the front and operate it in binary it

456
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:01,360
was much easier to plug a terminal in

457
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:03,279
then you could see listings on the

458
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:07,120
screen and edit them

459
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:09,599
but in virtually every way worse

460
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:11,438
than a mini computer it was smaller it

461
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:13,438
was cheaper it had less storage it was

462
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:14,880
slower

463
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:16,559
you have one to yourself there's no

464
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,400
multitasking it doesn't need it there's

465
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:21,439
no multi-user support

466
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:23,679
you own it why have multi-user support

467
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:24,559
so all this technology from the mini

468
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:27,679
computer era

469
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:28,639
thrown away not adapted not modified not

470
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,919
respected

471
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,520
if you heard the earlier talk they've

472
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:32,320
lost all the tapes of the early versions

473
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,760
of unix

474
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:35,360
nobody thought it was important thrown

475
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:38,160
away

476
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:40,719
they kept a couple of things this ran

477
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:43,919
cpm in later versions which had

478
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:47,039
os 8 like 8.3 file names and things

479
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:50,000
but not dil related to it totally

480
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:50,000
rewritten ground up

481
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:54,000
then computers got even smaller and even

482
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:55,760
cheaper and you could give them to kids

483
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,679
as toys

484
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:59,039
that's a sinclair spectrum in there

485
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:01,760
that's one of the original rubber key

486
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:02,879
ones but i at about age 13 put it into a

487
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:05,840
much nicer keyboard

488
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,840
and i've still got it

489
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:10,240
first home computer in the uk that you

490
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:12,799
could afford to buy just about for under

491
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:14,400
100 pounds as a kit

492
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:16,160
i played with things like a commodore

493
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:19,760
pet

494
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:21,280
my uncle bought a zx81 but i was like 12

495
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:22,799
and it didn't do graphics it didn't do

496
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:25,440
color it didn't do sound it was

497
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:27,039
boring but my spectrum had all of those

498
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,440
things it was great i loved it i still

499
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:31,440
play with them occasionally

500
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:34,080
if you know any biology this was the

501
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:37,440
time of the cambrian explosion

502
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:39,120
of computers there were hundreds of

503
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,480
different makes and models

504
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:42,719
a couple of guys involved in the

505
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:44,400
sinclair zx81 went off and set up

506
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,240
jupiter and made the jupiter ace the

507
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,280
only home computer to use fourth instead

508
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:50,000
of basic

509
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:52,000
there were six 502 machines z80 machines

510
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:55,760
six 809 machines

511
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:57,200
vast variety no two two-level storage in

512
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,640
these either

513
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,320
you could dump stuff to tape and that

514
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:02,640
was it

515
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:03,678
people were so fanatically loyal to

516
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:06,720
these machines they

517
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:08,559
loved them they engaged in

518
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:11,840
advocacy that makes linux distro

519
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:11,840
advocacy look very tame

520
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:15,199
and then another generation of computers

521
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,879
came along apple

522
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,480
more or less made the home computer

523
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:21,600
market in the states with a

524
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:24,960
1 000 computer the apple ii they

525
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:27,918
tried to make a 16-bit successor but

526
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:30,080
it cut into the margins so they

527
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:33,440
disrupted the market with the

528
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:35,120
apple lisa 10 000 machine and then they

529
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:37,200
replaced that with the mac a two and a

530
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:39,520
half thousand dollar machine

531
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,799
soon everybody copied it lots of new

532
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:44,080
companies launching

533
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:45,600
68 000 powered machines with graphical

534
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:48,000
operating systems

535
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:49,760
one weird little company in britain

536
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,080
called acorn

537
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:53,679
tried a 16-bit successor which is almost

538
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,559
totally forgotten it's called the acorn

539
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:57,440
communicator

540
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:58,000
it didn't do very well so they junked it

541
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,960
and they

542
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:03,679
came up with an insane plan to write

543
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:05,760
their own operating system for their own

544
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:08,080
microprocessor which they designed from

545
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:09,600
scratch

546
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:11,360
the project completely failed and

547
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,080
crashed and burned so a couple of guys

548
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,918
did a

549
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:15,360
frantic skunk works replacement which

550
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:20,559
became this

551
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:21,360
um colorful isn't it um this changed the

552
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:23,918
whole world

553
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:25,360
um they sold again millions of these

554
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:27,760
things

555
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:29,439
nothing came across from the 8-bits they

556
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,559
were not powerful enough to emulate the

557
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:34,799
old computers

558
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:37,280
so all of those millions of hours of r d

559
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:38,879
were totally thrown away they weren't

560
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:40,480
good enough they couldn't

561
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:42,400
run an emulator fast enough to run the

562
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:44,000
old software so they just didn't bother

563
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,679
they can't read the previous machines

564
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,520
disks they can't run the previous

565
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:50,159
machine software nothing

566
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:51,520
nothing works start the whole thing from

567
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:55,840
scratch

568
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:58,000
again you keeping count i'm not

569
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,000
so

570
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:04,880
i said that there was a parallel line of

571
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:06,320
development that started in the 70s

572
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:08,640
it's one that doesn't get talked about

573
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:09,760
much now and i only found out about it

574
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,600
in

575
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:13,039
research for a project which led to this

576
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:17,600
talk in my previous talk

577
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:19,280
um the mini computer makers

578
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:21,840
shrank their machines and made them

579
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:23,840
smaller and cheaper until they went from

580
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:25,039
a row of filing cabinets to one filing

581
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:27,120
cabinet to

582
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:28,640
a huge great box that was the size of a

583
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:31,199
desk to something

584
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:32,799
like a very fat tower pc that sat next

585
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:35,520
to your desk

586
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:37,280
and they invented the single user mini

587
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:40,559
computer

588
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:42,000
or workstation um one of the first was

589
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:46,639
the sun one

590
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,640
which fairly typical machine of its time

591
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,960
the aim in the early days of the

592
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:55,039
workstation market was a 3m

593
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:56,960
machine a million bytes of ram

594
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:59,360
a million instructions per second and a

595
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:02,880
million pixels on screen

596
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:04,559
laughably low spec now big deal then um

597
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:07,919
this is one of the famous influential

598
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:09,440
ones of course this is a xerox alto

599
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:10,960
that's the small talk programming

600
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:13,200
environment it ran

601
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:15,280
apple went and saw a demo of this and

602
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:17,600
totally failed to get the point

603
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:18,320
so they went home and took a machine

604
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:21,439
that ran

605
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:25,120
xenix the prototype apple lisa and they

606
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:28,159
adapted it with a sort of frantic

607
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:30,719
lash together graphical operating system

608
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:32,799
it's what kick-started the microcomputer

609
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:36,000
16-bit micro-evolution

610
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:38,400
this was actually the first popular

611
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,480
object-oriented programming language

612
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:42,640
this software was all live and dynamic

613
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:45,039
and written in the language itself

614
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:47,919
you could edit the code and change

615
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:49,520
windows surroundings frames on the fly

616
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:51,679
there's no compilers here there's no

617
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:55,120
static binaries it's one huge mass of

618
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:55,120
live code that you can look at and edit

619
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,039
what happened is mini computers merged

620
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:03,120
with

621
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:06,400
one terminal and became a very expensive

622
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:09,199
but powerful standalone machine they

623
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:11,280
cost as much as a small house so they

624
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,480
didn't make much market penetration they

625
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:15,039
really only sold

626
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:18,159
to research institutions universities

627
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:18,158
and a few wealthy companies

628
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,720
this is the descendant of another famous

629
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:25,840
workstation

630
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:28,240
this is a symbolics lisp machine

631
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:29,600
this is a later generation list machine

632
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,120
if you look at the window frame in the

633
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:33,039
menu bar you can see it's running on

634
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:35,360
macros but this is not an emulator

635
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:37,039
this is a list machine on a new bus card

636
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:39,039
fitted inside a mac its memory is

637
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:42,480
totally separate to the max memory

638
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:44,960
um another amazing operating system

639
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:46,720
um symbolics was a hugely important

640
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:48,960
company in its time symbolics had the

641
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:51,679
first ever.com domain on the internet

642
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:53,679
they were that big

643
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:55,039
again the entire environment written in

644
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:56,880
a single language

645
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:58,158
from the apps right down to the

646
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:02,159
bootloader

647
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:05,919
lisp famously hard to understand but

648
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:07,919
famously powerful and capable um

649
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:09,440
the list machines are indirectly

650
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:12,960
responsible for both

651
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:15,840
emacs and the gnu project so you can

652
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,840
arguably blame them

653
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:20,479
but most of the mini computer

654
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:22,720
manufacturers persisted with their old

655
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:24,799
operating systems this is a dec

656
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:27,120
vacstation 4000

657
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:28,400
um it's running vax vms with deck

658
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:30,080
windows on top

659
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:32,080
um i've got a couple of these one of

660
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:34,080
them is somewhere in

661
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:35,600
red hat's office in farnborough and if

662
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,879
anybody's connected with red hat i'd

663
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:39,678
really like to find that i'd quite like

664
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,679
to have it back please

665
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:46,799
dec did machines with their own vax

666
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:48,640
processors they also did machines with

667
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:49,918
mips processors and later on they

668
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:52,159
invented their own

669
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:54,159
risk chip alpha the first 64-bit risk

670
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:55,200
chip all completely incompatible with

671
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:56,480
each other

672
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,320
two of them running totally different

673
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:59,520
operating systems from unrelated unix

674
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:02,240
families

675
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:04,480
absolutely normal cross-compatibility

676
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:07,679
was not a thing nobody thought about it

677
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:09,120
so you know at the same time as micros

678
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:11,520
were getting

679
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:12,879
colorful graphics and fancy stereo sound

680
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,000
and

681
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:16,240
rich windowing environments the

682
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,440
workstations were having all that stuff

683
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:20,559
but they also had

684
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:22,000
built-in email built-in internet access

685
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:24,320
all these kind of wonderful facilities

686
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:28,159
in the 80s before the internet

687
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:30,240
let's go before the web

688
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:31,600
computers just sort of quietly faded

689
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:34,880
away

690
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:37,439
but these are the offspring so now

691
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:39,120
coming up to the end of the 80s the

692
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:41,520
start of the 90s

693
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:42,559
there's still about a half a dozen main

694
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:46,559
families of

695
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:48,480
incompatible computer which

696
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:50,799
make up most of the market for both home

697
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:53,840
computers and business computers

698
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:56,799
um another revolution

699
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:58,158
is coming another generation switch is

700
00:25:56,799 --> 00:26:00,799
coming

701
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:01,760
32-bit processors were becoming

702
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:03,440
affordable

703
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:05,360
they were cheap enough to start to put

704
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,960
into home computers

705
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:11,439
they were cheap enough to start to put

706
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:13,919
into ordinary desktop business computers

707
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:15,440
and that's when something happened that

708
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:17,279
had never happened before in the history

709
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:20,080
of computing

710
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:22,400
something very weird it led to the birth

711
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:25,439
of a new god

712
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:29,200
and in my opinion it's a dark

713
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:31,840
and malignant trickster god

714
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:33,440
it looked like a helpful friend it

715
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:38,639
wasn't

716
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:41,120
this is called backwards compatibility

717
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:44,000
the 32-bit chips didn't seem like a very

718
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:48,080
big deal for all the people making

719
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:50,960
gui powered pc comp computers

720
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:52,639
commodore atari apple their computers

721
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:56,080
just got a little bit faster

722
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:58,559
got a bit more memory great but the

723
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:59,600
very primitive little operating systems

724
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:02,639
that

725
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:06,480
today look tiny and svelt

726
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:09,600
and elegant they look they weren't

727
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:13,760
they still provoke huge nostalgia

728
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:15,039
in a certain type of middle-aged geek um

729
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:18,080
they couldn't be adapted to the new

730
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:21,760
capabilities of the newer chips

731
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:24,639
but the intel ones were a bit different

732
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:27,440
the intel 32-bit chip the first one the

733
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:29,919
386 came out in 1987 but it was fully

734
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:31,120
32-bit needed 32-bit memory on a 32-bit

735
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:33,279
motherboard and it was just too

736
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:36,879
expensive for most people

737
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:37,279
it was the later 386 sx with a 16-bit

738
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,120
bus

739
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:40,880
and 16-bit memory that made them cheap

740
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:42,559
and affordable

741
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:44,799
do you recognize this operating system

742
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:46,720
incidentally this is a very early beta

743
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:48,320
of what became windows 95

744
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:50,640
you can see that they really didn't

745
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:52,320
quite have the taskbar

746
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:54,480
idea and so on worked out in the

747
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:56,879
beginning um

748
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:57,679
the 386 had a secret feature feature

749
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:00,159
that is now

750
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:01,200
almost forgotten it is no longer present

751
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:05,360
in 64-bit

752
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:05,919
x86 chips a 386 can not only pretend to

753
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:10,719
be

754
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:12,880
the old early 816-bit 8088 processor

755
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:14,399
it can pretend to be several of them at

756
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:16,559
once

757
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:17,840
this was an absolute killer feature this

758
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:21,120
meant that once

759
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:24,320
microsoft adopted windows to three it

760
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:28,000
adapted windows to 386 chips

761
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:30,240
the new windows 3 could run dos apps

762
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,399
in a window multitask them and actually

763
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:34,559
run them better than on dos

764
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:36,320
you could copy and paste you could run

765
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:38,720
several of them side by side

766
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:41,360
you could run a spreadsheet because

767
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:43,120
we're talking about pcs

768
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:44,799
save the figures load them into a

769
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:47,520
graphing program and do a nice

770
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:49,279
chart because most spreadsheets couldn't

771
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:52,320
do that on the era of dos

772
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:54,399
um this was a huge change

773
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:58,000
and it made them a lot of money and it

774
00:28:54,399 --> 00:29:01,600
meant that as 32-bit caught on

775
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:04,799
it allowed the pc to catch up

776
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:06,080
with all of the proprietary graphical

777
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:09,760
machines

778
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:11,279
it got all those things that only the 68

779
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:13,440
000 owners had before

780
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:14,799
they got multitasking they got a nice

781
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:18,080
graphical interface

782
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:21,840
they got color and sound and video

783
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:21,840
and all this kind of cool stuff

784
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:30,799
so this was a new era but

785
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:30,799
it was very hard to adapt

786
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:35,039
ibm microsoft and apple struggled

787
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:38,080
massively around this time

788
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:41,520
ibm had a project called os2

789
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:46,000
some of you might have seen that um

790
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:47,840
os2 was very clever it was a

791
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,600
focused ground-up rewrite and

792
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:51,918
replacement for dos

793
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:53,678
but ibm targeted the 286 chip which

794
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:57,440
couldn't do the multitasking

795
00:29:53,679 --> 00:30:00,320
of dos apps feature it doomed the os

796
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:02,080
apple apple did an awful lot of flailing

797
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:05,200
around about this time

798
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:06,799
um i'll get back to that but microsoft

799
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:09,200
did something very interesting they took

800
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:11,039
a long-term view

801
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:13,600
they ran two side-by-side operating

802
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:17,360
system projects

803
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:20,158
one project took the fairly

804
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:23,279
shabby 16-bit gui that they had from the

805
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:24,640
80s and enhanced it

806
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:26,799
the other project was much more

807
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:29,760
interesting they started with the

808
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:31,679
cpu independent version of os2 which was

809
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:33,600
called os 2 version 3.

810
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:36,159
it ran on intel's attempt to make a

811
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:40,719
wrist chip which was code named the n10

812
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:42,960
so this project was code named os2nt um

813
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:43,760
it was barely a sketch of an operating

814
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,679
system at the time

815
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:47,760
so they went to digital and they poached

816
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:50,720
digital's programming lead

817
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:51,919
and his team dave cutler they gave them

818
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:55,360
os2 3 and said

819
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:59,600
finish it make it work um well os2

820
00:30:55,360 --> 00:31:02,158
n10 became os2nt which became windows nt

821
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:02,840
and you may not use it but you all know

822
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:06,399
it

823
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:10,799
um it looks like windows

824
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:14,080
it's nothing like windows underneath nt

825
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:16,320
it looks very much like digital vms

826
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:17,360
because it's written mostly by the same

827
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:19,600
team

828
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:20,959
the data storage structures the way it

829
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:23,120
handles interrupts and

830
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:24,159
ioqs and everything are all borrowed

831
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:27,279
very directly

832
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:30,640
from vms

833
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:34,080
it looks like a descendant of the

834
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:38,240
80s desktop pc but actually

835
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:40,960
it's really a descendant of a 1970s mini

836
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,960
computer os

837
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:44,158
apple well apple flailed around bless

838
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:48,000
them they really tried

839
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:49,760
um they tried to work with ibm

840
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,200
on a totally new object-oriented

841
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:54,158
operating system

842
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:56,159
it failed they tried to rewrite their

843
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:58,159
proprietary operating system to deliver

844
00:31:56,159 --> 00:32:01,760
true multitasking and so on

845
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:02,960
it failed they did a port of linux

846
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:06,158
running on top of the

847
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:09,679
micro kernel to their power pc max

848
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:12,159
it failed pretty much um they did a

849
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:13,120
radical pocket computer with the acorn

850
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:16,080
processor in it

851
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:17,678
within a lisp-based operating system it

852
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:20,480
did make it to market

853
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:22,000
failed um so in the end they gave up and

854
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,399
they bought a workstation company and

855
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,480
this

856
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:26,399
is what resulted they bought next of

857
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:28,159
course and

858
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:30,000
they went to unix like all the other

859
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:32,320
workstation makers

860
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,000
but the next programmers when apple

861
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:35,439
bought them put in a virtual machine and

862
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,519
in the virtual machine they ran an

863
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:39,120
entire copy of the old apple operating

864
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:41,840
system

865
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:43,439
to give backwards compatibility the new

866
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:44,639
god you've got to have it if you don't

867
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:47,679
have it

868
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:49,840
your computer's not worth having

869
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:49,840
so

870
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:57,840
the year 2000

871
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:02,158
variety the diversity of the 20th

872
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:04,799
century

873
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:05,760
has gone it's dead even microsoft's

874
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:09,519
weird hybrid

875
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:14,158
16-stroke 32-bit line is dead

876
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:18,240
it's left two types of computer

877
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:21,039
both are written in c

878
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:22,480
both are based on a very mini computer

879
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:25,279
like core design with

880
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:27,279
little walled off memory partitions with

881
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:30,320
compiled applications running in them

882
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:33,679
calling operating system facilities by a

883
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:33,678
rigorously defined api

884
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:37,840
often with visible c like properties

885
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:40,720
even if you're using a different

886
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:40,720
compiled language

887
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:48,240
the two families are of course unix and

888
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:50,000
windows nt and basically everything else

889
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:52,640
is gone

890
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,399
now i i rather like this this is from a

891
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:56,080
great little article about one of my

892
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:56,799
favorite obscure operating systems

893
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:59,039
oberon

894
00:33:56,799 --> 00:34:01,039
um a family tree of graphical operating

895
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:02,000
systems so doug engelbart the mother of

896
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:06,080
all demos

897
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:07,600
inspired the guys at xerox and xerox had

898
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:12,239
a visitor from the

899
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:15,759
uh eth in zurich professor niklaus fiert

900
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:17,279
the inventor of pascal he saw the

901
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:19,280
small talk system and he went wow this

902
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:20,639
is cool but they didn't have the budget

903
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:22,560
for such high-end kit

904
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:25,119
so he went back to zurich and he wrote

905
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,759
his own operating system in modular two

906
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:27,280
which he

907
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:28,960
really ought to have called pascal to if

908
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:32,240
he had better marketing skills

909
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:32,839
um and he called it the lilith and then

910
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:35,118
he did

911
00:34:32,839 --> 00:34:37,359
another successor operating system

912
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:39,520
called oberon

913
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:41,279
meanwhile the xerox park project

914
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:42,879
completely failed to be usefully

915
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:44,879
commercialized never sold but it

916
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:46,799
inspired the lisa which inspired the mac

917
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:49,918
which inspired mac os 10

918
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:53,599
and all graphical unixes

919
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:56,879
and it also inspired windows nt um

920
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:58,640
so here we are today we have

921
00:34:56,879 --> 00:35:00,078
two operating system families one is

922
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:02,160
descended from

923
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:03,920
a deck operating system from the 70s

924
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:05,359
which is descended from a deck operating

925
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:08,160
system in the 60s

926
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:09,279
and the other is inspired by a

927
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:11,279
third-party

928
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:16,079
deck mini computer operating system from

929
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:19,599
the 60s how's that for diversity

930
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:21,200
what happened well in the 50s mainframes

931
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:22,640
advanced they got better and better and

932
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:24,720
better

933
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:27,440
every time a new generation of

934
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:30,000
mainframes came they added facilities

935
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:31,760
they invented some clever stuff but they

936
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,119
didn't move on

937
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:35,280
because there comes a point when your

938
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:37,680
project is so big and

939
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:40,800
you can't usefully enhance it it does

940
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:42,799
everything you can think of and it works

941
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:44,079
meanwhile over in the micro side of

942
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:45,839
things and the mini computer side of

943
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:47,680
things we kept on getting generations of

944
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:49,359
computers with less storage and less

945
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:50,319
hardware facilities than the previous

946
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:52,640
generation

947
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:55,200
but cheaper and because they were

948
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:56,839
cheaper they sold lots of them

949
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:58,640
and that meant everything had to be

950
00:35:56,839 --> 00:36:01,279
rewritten

951
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:02,480
every 10 or 15 years for the entire

952
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:05,680
history of computing

953
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:08,400
we have thrown the entire thing away and

954
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:13,440
rewritten it from scratch

955
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:15,440
until about 1993 to 1994

956
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:16,560
1993 the release of the first version of

957
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:19,599
windows called

958
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:21,279
nt windows nt called 3.1 for licensing

959
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:24,400
reasons

960
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:27,440
and 1994 linux

961
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:30,400
version 1.0 um why

962
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:31,440
linux well this is sco open server six

963
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,880
this was

964
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:35,040
mainly sold as a server there's a clue

965
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:36,880
in the name the full function version

966
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:40,079
was one thousand four hundred dollars

967
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:42,960
for a single user license

968
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:45,040
ain't nobody can afford that on x86

969
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:46,400
boxes so we just rewrote the whole thing

970
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:47,920
but all of the developments that

971
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:49,839
happened on the workstations all the

972
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:53,520
developments that had happened in unix r

973
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:55,520
d oberon also inspired the unix guys to

974
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:57,520
create the successity unix which i think

975
00:36:55,520 --> 00:37:00,240
should be called unix 2 but was actually

976
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:02,160
called plan 9 from bell labs

977
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:03,359
it's window manager is directly inspired

978
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:05,118
by oberon

979
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:08,160
its editor is directly inspired by

980
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:10,160
oberon it's unix with true built-in

981
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:11,520
kubernetes in the kernel basically

982
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:13,200
processors can be mobile

983
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:14,800
processors can move across the network

984
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:17,680
to any compatible machine

985
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:19,680
subject to privileges and so on went

986
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:22,240
nowhere

987
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:23,759
what happened well what we had was good

988
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:26,000
enough

989
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:28,079
in the 90s instead of throwing away all

990
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:30,000
the 80s stuff and starting again

991
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:31,440
instead of moving forward we moved

992
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:34,880
backwards

993
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:36,800
we went back 25 years we took

994
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:39,440
sophisticated operating systems from

995
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:41,119
1970s mini computers

996
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:42,800
and we updated them and adapted them to

997
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:46,880
modern hardware

998
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:48,720
and that's where we've stayed since then

999
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:50,880
we've taken some of the nice 80s stuff

1000
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:54,720
we've got nice colorful gooeys on top

1001
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:57,920
we've added touch control to those guise

1002
00:37:54,720 --> 00:38:01,118
this is a unix computer with

1003
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:03,040
two-level store in my pocket

1004
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:04,160
i bet everybody here has got a computer

1005
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:06,480
in their pocket some of you have

1006
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:09,598
probably got several

1007
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:11,200
but it was good enough we didn't throw

1008
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:18,240
everything away we didn't burn it down

1009
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:21,279
we just kept going

1010
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:25,118
so now you have two choices

1011
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:25,680
you can go with 40 years of accumulated

1012
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:30,800
baggage

1013
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:34,000
from the ibm pc there's windows 1

1014
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:36,160
or you can choose unix and have 50 years

1015
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:39,760
of accumulated baggage yay

1016
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:41,598
that is gnome one incidentally um

1017
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:43,200
that's your choice why well because it's

1018
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:45,200
good enough we all know it

1019
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:46,399
it works well we've fixed most of the

1020
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:49,839
bugs now

1021
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:51,599
it'll do it does the job there haven't

1022
00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:53,440
been any big technical shake-ups since

1023
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:55,119
those 32-bit pcs

1024
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:56,800
these mini computer operating systems

1025
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:58,720
could handle 8-bit computers 9-bit

1026
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:00,400
computers 12-bit computers 16-bit

1027
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:05,359
computers 18-bit computers

1028
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:07,359
and 38-bit computers 64-bit no problem

1029
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:10,240
as the previous speaker said minix unix

1030
00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:13,040
was running on multi-processor computers

1031
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:14,399
in the 70s multi-core processors no

1032
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:17,920
problem

1033
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:17,920
so that's where we are

1034
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:23,599
i'm sorry this is a cruel example this

1035
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:25,920
is 50 years of baggage

1036
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:26,960
we are well half of us anyway are still

1037
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:28,800
using

1038
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:31,440
basically the first ever interactive

1039
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,440
screen editor

1040
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:37,119
i started using this in 1988 i still

1041
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:39,760
hate it with a passion

1042
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:41,040
but just in case i tried telling emacs

1043
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,680
and i hate that with a passion as well

1044
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:45,839
so you know

1045
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:47,279
um um i use a

1046
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:48,880
i use a graphical thing called oxygen

1047
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:52,400
for my job um

1048
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:56,079
i hate it too but um we haven't really

1049
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:58,800
moved forward

1050
00:39:56,079 --> 00:40:02,000
we now have computers based on 70s

1051
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:05,839
worktation technology

1052
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:08,480
all of the advances since the beginning

1053
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:12,000
of the 1970s and

1054
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:12,880
into the 1980s there was some wonderful

1055
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,880
stuff out there

1056
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:18,000
amazing dynamic programming languages to

1057
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:21,119
construct rich internet capable guise

1058
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,800
lisp small talk they still exist

1059
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:25,359
they're niche programming languages now

1060
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:28,400
operating systems and forget about it

1061
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:30,160
there were new radical unix-based

1062
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:32,079
operating systems like plan nine and its

1063
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:34,000
successor inferno these are both really

1064
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:36,400
worth your time to have a look at

1065
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:39,119
inferno didn't just take the network

1066
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:40,880
transparency of plan nine it gave you

1067
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:42,400
processor transparency as well it

1068
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:43,200
embedded a virtual machine into the

1069
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:45,440
kernel

1070
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:46,560
but not like the jvm which it went up

1071
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:48,400
against this was a

1072
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:49,680
register based virtual machine it's much

1073
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:51,520
easier to optimize

1074
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:53,598
all modern processors are register based

1075
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:56,079
because you can optimize them

1076
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:58,000
the jvm is stack based all the stack

1077
00:40:56,079 --> 00:41:01,040
based computers have gone away

1078
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:02,319
um there were c plus plus operating

1079
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:04,240
systems in the 90s

1080
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:07,279
i personally used to use scion computers

1081
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:08,959
with epoc32 which became symbian which

1082
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:12,480
powered all the early mobile

1083
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:14,800
smartphones gone away um there was bos

1084
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:16,319
the nearly new apple operating system

1085
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:17,280
they'd be totally dead now if they

1086
00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:20,400
bought it

1087
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:22,480
it's gone away buried inside access inc

1088
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:24,160
in japan there's haiku which is lovely

1089
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:27,839
and i like haiku a lot but it is not

1090
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:27,839
small fast and elegant like bs was

1091
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:33,520
software went backwards as the hardware

1092
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:36,480
went forwards

1093
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:39,440
all the major revolutions in computing

1094
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:43,119
that have defined the generations

1095
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:47,119
have been defined when the hardware got

1096
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:49,359
worse not better

1097
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:51,760
every time we have had to adopt a new

1098
00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:54,400
generation of computers

1099
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:56,480
mini computers then 8-bit micros then

1100
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:58,000
all-in-one 8-bit micros then 16-bit

1101
00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:00,400
micros

1102
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:02,160
everything was thrown away and destroyed

1103
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:04,800
and we started again it was

1104
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:06,720
normal it was just what you did but you

1105
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:08,240
started again with new better languages

1106
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:10,560
and new better ideas

1107
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:13,118
and in about mid 90s that crashed to a

1108
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:15,279
halt and we haven't done it since

1109
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:17,680
because the hardware hasn't got worse

1110
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:21,280
since the mid 90s

1111
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:23,440
we are stuck now with multi-gigabyte

1112
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:25,520
operating systems with tens of millions

1113
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:27,359
of lines of code in dozens of languages

1114
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:28,880
that no one human being can understand

1115
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:30,880
anymore

1116
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:32,640
and we can't substantially improve them

1117
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:34,400
anymore because they're so big and so

1118
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:36,720
complicated we just don't really

1119
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:38,560
understand them so now we're developing

1120
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:39,919
things like container technology which i

1121
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:41,680
document for a living

1122
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:43,119
which understands that they'll fail all

1123
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:44,480
the time and detects when they fail and

1124
00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:46,800
restarts them in a quick and efficient

1125
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:46,800
manner

1126
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:52,880
software is culture and our culture has

1127
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:56,560
been stultifying

1128
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:59,680
for 25 years when 25 years ago it

1129
00:42:56,560 --> 00:43:01,520
reached back another 25 years

1130
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:03,919
we need a new generation of worse

1131
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:06,319
computers

1132
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:09,599
we need simpler computers we need to

1133
00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:09,599
take something away

1134
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:17,119
i propose next slide please

1135
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:19,040
oh yeah seminal paper you should

1136
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:21,760
absolutely all read this

1137
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:26,720
c is not a low level language your

1138
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:29,839
computer is not a first pdp 11.

1139
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:29,839
excellent paper um

1140
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:36,640
so we took the radical guise of the 80s

1141
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:38,720
in their marvellous object-oriented

1142
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:40,640
dynamic languages and we reint

1143
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:42,078
re-implemented them with statically

1144
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:44,319
compiled manually memory managed

1145
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:47,200
languages with weak typing

1146
00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:49,920
and um yeah they're shiny and

1147
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:54,319
everybody's got distracted by the shiny

1148
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:58,000
this might might save us

1149
00:43:54,319 --> 00:44:01,200
it's a very big if these are

1150
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:04,880
a pair of intel optane

1151
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:06,960
nvdimms i maintain the

1152
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:08,800
section in the suse enterprise linux

1153
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:10,000
documentation relating to supporting

1154
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:11,920
these devices

1155
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,359
um i got the job because i was the only

1156
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:13,920
person who'd heard of an nvdimm on the

1157
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:16,319
team

1158
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:18,480
um probably shouldn't have disclosed

1159
00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:22,160
that should i um

1160
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:23,200
this is a big shift if it happens it's

1161
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:25,839
not going to be

1162
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:27,919
risk 5 it's not going to be an

1163
00:44:25,839 --> 00:44:28,880
out-of-the-box mill processor it's not

1164
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:30,480
going to be

1165
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:32,319
processors at all it's going to be

1166
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:35,839
storage this

1167
00:44:32,319 --> 00:44:37,839
is kind of like flash memory

1168
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:40,000
it's much much better than flash memory

1169
00:44:37,839 --> 00:44:41,759
it's orders of magnitude faster

1170
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,280
it can be rewritten orders of magnitude

1171
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:48,480
more times

1172
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:48,480
um it's also substantially cheaper than

1173
00:44:48,839 --> 00:44:54,480
ram you can

1174
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:56,799
buy it as a very high speed pcie

1175
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:58,560
ssd but you can also buy it as a dim and

1176
00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:00,720
stick it straight into the dim sockets

1177
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:03,040
on your server motherboard

1178
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:05,200
it's not like an ssd it's not pretending

1179
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:08,240
to be a disk drive it's memory

1180
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:09,839
right in the processor's memory map

1181
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:12,560
except whatever you write there just

1182
00:45:09,839 --> 00:45:14,560
stays there you can pull the plug

1183
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:16,400
when you put the plug back in the

1184
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:17,599
contents of memory are exactly as they

1185
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:20,800
were

1186
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:22,640
now it's true this has a finite lifespan

1187
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:24,240
it's many millions of rewrites in the

1188
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:25,759
current early versions and there are

1189
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:29,040
multiple companies working on

1190
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:30,720
non-volatile memory if you ran one

1191
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:32,160
little loop counting to a million in a

1192
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:32,640
block of this ram it would burn out the

1193
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:34,240
ram

1194
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:35,759
so probably you're going to have some

1195
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:37,759
ordinary ram in there as well but you

1196
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:39,680
can partition the workspace

1197
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:42,000
you can have a computer based on this

1198
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:43,839
you don't need disk drives anymore

1199
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,440
and if you don't need disk drives you

1200
00:45:43,839 --> 00:45:46,880
don't need disk controllers

1201
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:48,720
if you don't need disk controllers you

1202
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:49,359
don't need the whole concept of a file

1203
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:51,040
system

1204
00:45:49,359 --> 00:45:52,640
which is a way of finding blocks of

1205
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:53,839
secondary storage

1206
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:57,598
finding the right one and loading it

1207
00:45:53,839 --> 00:46:00,000
into ram that is now an obsolete concept

1208
00:45:57,599 --> 00:46:02,160
we go back to the 40s with machines with

1209
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:04,240
magnetic non-volatile memory

1210
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:07,759
the whole distinction between primary

1211
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:10,078
and secondary storage can just go away

1212
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:11,440
you don't boot the operating system you

1213
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:13,599
turn off the computer when you turn it

1214
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:15,440
back on it's still there in memory

1215
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:17,440
just picks up where it left off you

1216
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:18,960
don't install an operating system

1217
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:20,880
you boot the thing off the network when

1218
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:22,319
it's new and there's the operating

1219
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:25,200
system in memory and it just stays there

1220
00:46:22,319 --> 00:46:25,200
until you upgrade it

1221
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:29,119
why bother with disk files there's no

1222
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:30,720
files anymore you don't need files

1223
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:32,960
everything's just a block of memory you

1224
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:34,480
just need some system every operating

1225
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:36,240
system there has ever been

1226
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:37,680
has systems for managing and allocating

1227
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:39,040
their memory and deciding what's in

1228
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:40,399
where and keeping track of it this is

1229
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:43,839
not new technology

1230
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:47,760
this is old technology but

1231
00:46:43,839 --> 00:46:48,720
this is simpler this stuff is way

1232
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:50,960
cheaper

1233
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:52,640
than ram at the moment it's more

1234
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:55,280
expensive than flash but i think in a

1235
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:57,118
few years it's going to replace flash

1236
00:46:55,280 --> 00:47:00,880
and then the whole idea of the ssd goes

1237
00:46:57,119 --> 00:47:00,880
away this will be

1238
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:08,078
the rest of my notes thing um

1239
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:10,800
simpler and because it's simpler

1240
00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:12,800
it'll be cheaper and every major

1241
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:15,599
generation of worse computers has been

1242
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:17,200
driven by the fact that they're cheaper

1243
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:19,280
because that's all the manufacturers

1244
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:19,839
really care about is not clever software

1245
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:22,960
it's how

1246
00:47:19,839 --> 00:47:25,759
much profit margin there is

1247
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:26,880
my um iphone is three years old now i

1248
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:30,160
bought it second hand and

1249
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:31,119
uh battery's second battery is nearly

1250
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:32,319
dead now

1251
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:34,000
i'm probably going to replace it with

1252
00:47:32,319 --> 00:47:35,279
another chinese android phone because i

1253
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:37,920
can get a much better one

1254
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:39,599
for 100 pounds cheaper is what drives

1255
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:42,000
everything

1256
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:43,680
i think we don't need better computers

1257
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,200
we don't need more processor cores we

1258
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:46,879
don't need better gpus i mean we're

1259
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:49,040
going to get them anyway

1260
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:50,480
you know what we need we need worse

1261
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:52,720
computers

1262
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:54,319
we need an inferior generation of

1263
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:56,720
simpler machines

1264
00:47:54,319 --> 00:47:58,558
that lack major facilities that we take

1265
00:47:56,720 --> 00:48:00,959
for granted these days

1266
00:47:58,559 --> 00:48:03,839
that make us tear everything down set

1267
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:05,680
fire to it and start again

1268
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:07,440
it sounds ridiculous because you've all

1269
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:08,960
been worshiping the god of backwards

1270
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:12,720
compatibility

1271
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:14,480
for 25 years but actually that's done a

1272
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:16,160
massive amount of harm to the whole

1273
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:19,359
world of computing

1274
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:21,598
it's time to start over it's time to

1275
00:48:19,359 --> 00:48:24,799
burn the whole thing down

1276
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:35,839
and reboot it and that's it thank you

1277
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:35,839
very much

1278
00:48:37,359 --> 00:48:39,759
thank you

1279
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:46,559
thank you yeah proven for this talk i

1280
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:50,240
think it was very fascinating over

1281
00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:51,280
all this history um we have time for one

1282
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:55,279
question so please

1283
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:58,079
keep seated if there is one question

1284
00:48:55,280 --> 00:49:01,040
and wait for it we are just nearly done

1285
00:48:58,079 --> 00:49:01,040
is there a question

1286
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:08,240
if you have a question just wait for me

1287
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:16,078
or i don't see a quest

1288
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:19,359
ah there's one question

1289
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:20,559
there's some contact details if you want

1290
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:22,880
to tell me i'm completely wrong

1291
00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:26,319
afterward hi liam

1292
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:31,839
question given that we have

1293
00:49:26,319 --> 00:49:31,839
40 years or 50 years

1294
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:37,359
where on earth do you think the the

1295
00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:40,480
operating system

1296
00:49:37,359 --> 00:49:43,440
iconoclasm is going to come from

1297
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:44,880
to actually make use rather than

1298
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:47,839
reinventing another wheel

1299
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:49,599
in software with of this new hardware so

1300
00:49:47,839 --> 00:49:52,720
the question was where will this

1301
00:49:49,599 --> 00:49:54,400
operating system iconoclasm come from i

1302
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:56,720
think the open source community is

1303
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:59,760
ideally positioned to do this

1304
00:49:56,720 --> 00:50:02,480
because it's going to be risky which is

1305
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:05,040
something businesses are very averse to

1306
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:07,760
um every important new generation of

1307
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:09,920
computer when it came out was a toy

1308
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:12,559
it wasn't serious it wasn't something

1309
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:14,480
you did big serious work with

1310
00:50:12,559 --> 00:50:16,800
it was a toy that you played around with

1311
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:18,800
and you know what ms-dos was a toy when

1312
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:22,000
it was launched cpm was a toy

1313
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:26,079
linux was a toy and i quote i think it

1314
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:27,839
won't be big and serious like gnu we

1315
00:50:26,079 --> 00:50:30,960
should start playing around

1316
00:50:27,839 --> 00:50:32,960
those of us who don't need to risk our

1317
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:35,520
company budget on it

1318
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:36,960
and start playing around there are open

1319
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:38,720
source versions of small talk and list

1320
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:40,000
which are ideal for this there's oberon

1321
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:41,598
out there it's open source

1322
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:43,440
there's plan nine there's materials to

1323
00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:45,440
draw on

1324
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:46,960
but start again re-implement it play

1325
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:47,839
around come up with toys who has the

1326
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:51,119
most

1327
00:50:47,839 --> 00:50:51,119
cool new toy to program with

1328
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:59,040
next question yeah i think that's a good

1329
00:50:57,119 --> 00:51:00,640
good end for this talk and a good

1330
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:03,599
motivation to do something

1331
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:05,580
so um thank you again for the talk for

1332
00:51:03,599 --> 00:51:14,489
everybody else

1333
00:51:05,580 --> 00:51:14,489
[Applause]

1334
00:51:16,559 --> 00:51:18,640
you
