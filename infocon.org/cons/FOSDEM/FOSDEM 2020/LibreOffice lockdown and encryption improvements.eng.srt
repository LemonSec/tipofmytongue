1
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:12,240
okay

2
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:14,719
shall we start sorry for the small delay

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,480
um i managed to i thought i would give

4
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:19,119
you a demo um what i

5
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,080
was actually about to talk about was on

6
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:22,160
windows

7
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,278
unfortunately i managed to lock myself

8
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,320
out of bitlocker

9
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:28,720
um so that plan exploded so

10
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,560
but this is absolutely on topic because

11
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:33,920
the talks about

12
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:35,680
lockdown encryption security sometimes

13
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,879
it's a bit too secure so you

14
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:42,079
can't access even your legitimate

15
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:42,079
data anymore anyway

16
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:47,919
so one slide about me just um

17
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:50,559
anybody who might not know me um my name

18
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:54,160
is force byrons i work for cib

19
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:54,879
we do consulting around libreoffice we

20
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,279
also do

21
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:58,160
lts versions and lots of other cool

22
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:02,000
things

23
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:04,399
um i'm with the project since many years

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,840
i'm also active in the on the document

25
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,880
foundation

26
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:11,200
board etc and beyond that um

27
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:14,320
i'm out there and advocating for open

28
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:17,680
source and open standards

29
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,479
right so credits um this is mostly not

30
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:22,000
my work

31
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:23,759
um so i'd like to um

32
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,640
highlight the people who did the actual

33
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:30,320
work my colleagues vasily sash

34
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:33,920
and samuel the work itself

35
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:36,639
i will talk about here mostly

36
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,840
as an example that it was a customer

37
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:41,119
project

38
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:44,880
um there was

39
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:44,880
very large um

40
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:51,840
bank that wanted to use liberal office

41
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,759
which is a great thing the problem is

42
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,520
that banking regulations

43
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,439
all over the world are sometimes rather

44
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:00,719
strict and one of the

45
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:03,758
uh challenges that this bank was facing

46
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:03,759
was the fact that

47
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:11,200
they couldn't let the users arbitrarily

48
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:12,160
access documents so they needed to put

49
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:15,280
controls

50
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:16,480
under what people could do with office

51
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,520
documents

52
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:22,959
for example not let them print

53
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:26,319
or copy that or even take screenshots

54
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:28,640
from it so

55
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:31,200
you might know that from from pdf it's

56
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:32,399
it's for pdf it's a it's a suggestion so

57
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,440
readers can

58
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:38,560
obviously ignore that

59
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:41,840
um there's other software where there's

60
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,319
like um rights management system where

61
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,040
there's

62
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:46,000
more for lockdown here and in this

63
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,319
particular case

64
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,160
um there is some uh from uh for from

65
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:52,560
microsoft for microsoft office

66
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,280
there's a solution called um microsoft

67
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,080
rms

68
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:58,239
rights management solution that is

69
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:01,920
pretty effective

70
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:02,800
in locking down what users can do with

71
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,879
the documents and

72
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,959
that's actually there was a requirement

73
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:10,239
one of the entry requirements

74
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:13,120
um for for that customer to even be able

75
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:14,319
uh to employ software on their client

76
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:18,000
machines

77
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:20,079
so um we went and thought about that

78
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,120
and um looked a bit into the the

79
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,840
technology there

80
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:26,000
and figured out it's actually impossible

81
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:29,200
to do that um with libreoffice

82
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:32,560
um so we went ahead um and

83
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:33,518
it's um actually right now so there's

84
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,760
some

85
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:37,920
there's a branch where it's implemented

86
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,599
there's a number of patches

87
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,040
waiting for integration into the

88
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:44,319
upcoming

89
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:47,120
libreoffice 7 0.

90
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:47,839
we didn't quite manage six four for that

91
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,959
because it was

92
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:53,040
rather involved and lots of api

93
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:55,439
changes and code changes there so we

94
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:58,798
don't want to risk that

95
00:03:55,439 --> 00:04:02,879
um right so

96
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:05,040
that's for the the outset um

97
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:06,399
that's essentially what i just told you

98
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,599
um but i didn't want to distract you

99
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:11,360
with the slide

100
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:11,679
um the um the the challenge really there

101
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,200
is

102
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:17,840
um for a desktop computers because

103
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,399
for on a desktop machine users usually

104
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:21,119
have a

105
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:22,719
lot of things they can do they can do

106
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,040
copy paste

107
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,240
they can save under a different name and

108
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,639
then do things

109
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,680
they can perhaps look at the the file

110
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:32,080
system

111
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:34,720
and just take the bits and walk away

112
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:38,320
with them if there's a temporary file

113
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:40,800
um they can take screenshots etc so um

114
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:43,520
there's a level of control necessary and

115
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:46,240
also a level of

116
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:48,560
lockdown up from and lockdown support

117
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:52,320
from the operating system that you need

118
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:54,400
and to the best of my knowledge that is

119
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,360
probably only really working to that

120
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,799
extent

121
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:01,600
on windows um at least for

122
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,800
for client for client side you can do a

123
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:06,320
lot more

124
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:09,680
if you have a virtual

125
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:11,919
machine or a virtual desktop solution

126
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,360
where you the users can't really get at

127
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:14,880
the bits

128
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,800
but you can then probably still do

129
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,320
screenshots but i suppose you can do

130
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,880
that anyway with a

131
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:25,759
i mean just physically take a picture

132
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:29,680
from the screen

133
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:33,039
right so um that's how it looks for

134
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:36,560
um for this microsoft thing

135
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:39,680
um basically um what happens is

136
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,880
there's a document that's encrypted on

137
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:44,000
the server

138
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,479
that gets downloaded by any possible

139
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
means

140
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:51,199
mail attachment shared file system

141
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,520
you name it downloads

142
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:55,280
so normally you can't users can't access

143
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:58,560
that so if they want to access it

144
00:05:55,280 --> 00:06:01,198
they need to authenticate against um

145
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,759
this this little um thing here in the

146
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:04,800
middle

147
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:08,880
um the i don't know if i got a

148
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:13,199
mouse yes i do this this guy here

149
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:16,960
which then talks to the um to the client

150
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:20,000
a little component on on the client um

151
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:24,239
on the desktop machine um

152
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:27,840
and what in the end um

153
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:31,039
the the this little plug in there needs

154
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:32,799
um is a temporary session key um

155
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:34,719
that is not something that the user will

156
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,720
get permanently that's not like

157
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:39,280
public public key cryptography that's

158
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,479
that's some some password that the user

159
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,880
can always use

160
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:44,400
it's a temporary session key and the

161
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,960
problem with the temporary session key

162
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,758
is that

163
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,400
um if the user can get access to that it

164
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:51,199
becomes a

165
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,599
non-temporary session key so you really

166
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,960
want

167
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:58,400
um this um this whole thing to be

168
00:06:54,960 --> 00:07:02,159
um controlled or or

169
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:05,039
um a trustworthy environment where

170
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:06,160
the the key and the data cannot get out

171
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:08,000
so so that's why

172
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,440
um this this ims rights management

173
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,440
system requires

174
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,719
at least the code that interacts with

175
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:16,080
the system and that

176
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:20,000
decrypts and handles the data uh

177
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:20,479
to be signed so that the the client side

178
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,960
can

179
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:24,479
actually assess whether it has been

180
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,799
tampered with

181
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:29,039
um so code has been has to be signed and

182
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:31,120
the extension has to be signed

183
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:33,199
and the user needs to authenticate

184
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:36,080
against this decline site which then

185
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:39,759
talks to the server and then the server

186
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:42,639
says okay when the trust chain is

187
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:44,400
is intact it will hand out a temporary

188
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:46,000
session key and the

189
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,520
session key then travels all the way

190
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,919
back and um

191
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,120
the extension can then using the

192
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:53,520
declined

193
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,800
component that decrypt the document but

194
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,719
then needs to

195
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,000
for for that to work that needs to tell

196
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,319
libreoffice to

197
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,440
disable certain things like for example

198
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:04,160
copy paste

199
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:06,319
or printing or saving under a different

200
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:09,680
name

201
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:10,960
so for that we had to tweak a bit what

202
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,599
libreoffice can do

203
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:15,758
there were already are there are there

204
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:19,680
very few things already that could

205
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:22,560
um be done in terms of lockdown um

206
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:24,319
but it wasn't far from complete so the

207
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,599
the most important part that we had to

208
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:27,919
change was the

209
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:29,440
the way that document and decryption

210
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:33,279
works because that

211
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:35,519
had to happen in this client library

212
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:37,039
and since we wanted to at least in

213
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:40,240
principle have this

214
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:43,760
um technology agnostic and

215
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:46,000
there are ways to do

216
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:47,279
you cannot prevent a screenshot but

217
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,640
there are ways to

218
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:52,839
at least clone that sort of system for

219
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:55,519
something like

220
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:58,800
gpg and

221
00:08:55,519 --> 00:09:01,120
other public key cryptography systems so

222
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,880
we added api for that there's a very

223
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:06,320
small wrapper extension

224
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:08,399
that maps the api

225
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,000
to the through the rms system that you

226
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:12,399
could um use also

227
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,760
that's really small it's more or less

228
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:16,160
passing things through

229
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:18,240
an adapter if you will and you can do

230
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:21,360
that adjust the same for

231
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:25,360
um for other technology for

232
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:28,640
for for mac or win for linux

233
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:31,279
right so so this this api then

234
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,240
um disables or enables depending on the

235
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:36,640
meter data

236
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:40,240
that gets passed on the the features so

237
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:43,760
um that's how it works as a sequence

238
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:46,800
diagram more or less um

239
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:50,160
again um what i what i mentioned

240
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:51,279
um the the important part really is this

241
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:54,560
um

242
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:56,800
the integrity here so that that

243
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,760
um at least the extension needs to be

244
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,800
signed

245
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:04,240
um and the session key doesn't

246
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:07,760
doesn't really never leaves the

247
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:10,800
um this kind of

248
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:12,560
locked down or or or uh signed code so

249
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:15,680
that never really ends up in

250
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:17,518
in libreoffice code for example so that

251
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:20,000
that stays within this this kind of

252
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:20,959
lockdown environment and libreoffice

253
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,720
gets

254
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:27,760
the the decrypted bits out of the api

255
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:29,360
plus meter data what is permitted uh

256
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:33,040
what it can do with that or

257
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:35,920
cannot do

258
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:37,439
so most of that work actually ended up

259
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,719
in libreoffice and there's a bit of a

260
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,920
wrapper on top

261
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:46,000
um potentially um you can do

262
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:49,519
some something similar uh with a glue pg

263
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,480
um the the um the sticking point really

264
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:52,880
is you want to

265
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:54,959
you want to authenticate both the user

266
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:58,000
and you want to authenticate

267
00:10:54,959 --> 00:11:02,079
the the code so so there has to be some

268
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:05,120
uh like um um

269
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:07,439
in in other um for other systems some

270
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:09,279
some sort of measuring from from the

271
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,040
outside that ensures that so it has to

272
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:11,680
be a separate system component that

273
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,519
looks

274
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:15,279
looks at libreoffice and the extension

275
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:19,279
and authenticates or

276
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:22,480
asserts that it's that it's intact

277
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:26,160
um so that is something that

278
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:27,839
potentially um depending on somebody

279
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,920
coming up and thinking that's a good

280
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:32,480
idea and perhaps funding that

281
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:33,279
um there could be something we can do

282
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:37,839
with that

283
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:41,279
um api in place so um

284
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:42,240
towing wise oh yeah that's still some

285
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:45,279
time left

286
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:48,399
so that's the core change um

287
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:52,000
that we did that affects essentially

288
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:53,120
um how libreoffice uh decrypts and

289
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,320
encrypts

290
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:59,360
uh documents that has some some

291
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:04,000
knock-on effects that would

292
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:06,959
also permit um novel

293
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,160
encryption schemes without any chord

294
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:11,760
changes

295
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:15,600
so there's thinking around um

296
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:19,519
um changing or adjusting the way that um

297
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:24,240
odf encryption package encryption works

298
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:27,279
that's right now with clumsy because um

299
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:29,040
odf is a zip archive essentially and the

300
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:31,439
encryption works like every

301
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,399
single item in the sub archive gets

302
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:35,519
encrypted

303
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:36,720
individually which is not a problem if

304
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:40,240
you have

305
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:42,720
i don't know a standard writer

306
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:45,120
document and with with no images if you

307
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:47,200
have a large impress document with

308
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:49,360
hundreds of slides and hundreds of

309
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,800
images then every single image gets

310
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:53,680
encrypted and decrypted

311
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:54,959
which is a drain on your um on on your

312
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:58,638
uh

313
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:59,599
random um on your on your random number

314
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:02,320
generator

315
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:03,760
and your entropy and it's also really

316
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:06,639
bloody slow because the

317
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:08,240
um the encryption setup um usually if

318
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:10,959
you if you use a password

319
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:12,720
that gets some some uh key generation

320
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:15,040
function so it iterates a number of

321
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,000
thousands of times over the key to get a

322
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,719
encryption key

323
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,959
and you need to do that for every single

324
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:24,079
document and it's really really slow

325
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:27,119
um so with that that's that's now

326
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:30,239
plug-in encryption and decryption um

327
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:31,839
method um available in libreoffice well

328
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:34,639
almost um as i said

329
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:37,200
the patches are not merged it's a stack

330
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:40,320
of changes that didn't make

331
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,320
libreoffice 6-4

332
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,079
okay

333
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,560
so yeah i would have loved to show you

334
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:52,239
that

335
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:56,479
live the problem is um as i said

336
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:57,199
i um that um lockdown worked a bit too

337
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:01,120
well

338
00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:04,399
so um that's how it looks in um in word

339
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:07,680
um the there's this little um

340
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:08,880
so that obviously i had permission to

341
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,839
read this document

342
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:12,320
this document i got all the rights here

343
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:14,320
so i

344
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:16,720
i got this little info bar there that

345
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:19,360
tells me what i can do with it

346
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:21,519
and then there's a a toolbar where you

347
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:23,440
can say well i want to save that

348
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:25,760
and i want to give this group of users

349
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:27,440
that kind of permission now

350
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:29,199
which unfortunately i can't show you

351
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:32,240
because it's just a

352
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:35,439
screenshot um and that's how it looks

353
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:37,279
in libreoffice so we we tweaked i mean

354
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:39,519
among other things we also tweaked about

355
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:40,160
the the info bar so the info bar can now

356
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:43,440
do

357
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:44,000
rather nice complex um things like this

358
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:47,519
here so

359
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:51,600
multi-line and formatting there and

360
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:53,680
more than one control um etc

361
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,519
so that's exactly the same document

362
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:58,079
against exactly the same

363
00:14:55,519 --> 00:15:00,000
rms instance and it comes up with

364
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:02,959
exactly the right

365
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,160
permissions um and so it works

366
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:07,599
transparently

367
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:09,839
um in that system and it's

368
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,120
as i said it's a small wrapper extension

369
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:14,000
um that

370
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,560
unfortunately we can't um open source

371
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,320
that

372
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,680
for a number of reasons one of them is

373
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:22,079
actually it needs to be

374
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:26,270
signed and locked down and

375
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:29,040
being taken aside okay um

376
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:32,480
[Music]

377
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:33,680
any questions so far nicholas is it my

378
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,320
purpose that you use

379
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,319
rms

380
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:41,279
i'm sorry that's the acronym for that um

381
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:42,880
that's lots of ambiguity i mean you just

382
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:45,040
don't have so many

383
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:46,160
combinations of three letters but it's

384
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,880
no in this case it's

385
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,880
not on purpose

386
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,680
yeah right but it's a it's a part of

387
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:58,959
windows

388
00:15:55,680 --> 00:16:01,279
it is a it's an optional component but i

389
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:02,800
believe at least under windows 10 you

390
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:05,040
can just say

391
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:08,240
this is a package prerequisite and it

392
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,240
gets gets installed

393
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:23,640
you look like you want to ask a question

394
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:28,069
or make a comment

395
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:28,069
[Laughter]

396
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:34,079
right okay

397
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:51,839
if there's no further question thanks

398
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:51,839
for your attention

399
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:54,160
you
