1
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:09,760
good morning

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:11,840
this talk is a pharaoh is the year is

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:14,559
present in pharaoh that is uh

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:15,280
is not a new language but it still is a

5
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:17,599
minimal

6
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:18,880
pure object oriented reflected language

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,039
that is

8
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,080
quite as small in itself but is very

9
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:24,000
powerful because

10
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,359
on top of it we have created a lot of

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,359
things

12
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,720
this talk was intended to be presented

13
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:32,000
by stefan dukas

14
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:35,440
but i am not a stephan dugas sorry

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,160
he has a problem with the arriving here

16
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,718
with the

17
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,519
the trains in france we are in the

18
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:43,040
middle of a

19
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,520
big really big strike it's not a problem

20
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,559
at all

21
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,440
but sometimes makes the things a little

22
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:50,640
more difficult

23
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:52,079
well i am paulo de sonem i am one of the

24
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,440
engineers working in the pharaoh

25
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,360
consortium

26
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,800
basically i am working also in the

27
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:59,920
development of

28
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:02,559
pharaoh with steph so i want

29
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,840
to present it i i think it will not be

30
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:07,119
the same but i will do

31
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,840
the best that i can well faro what is

32
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:11,280
faro

33
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:13,200
well faro is a

34
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,960
small talk in spirit inspired language

35
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,080
and environment and is

36
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:18,720
not new but this question is always we

37
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,158
have it

38
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:24,560
why to use faro yes faro because for us

39
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:26,000
the most important thing and the thing

40
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:29,360
that we want to share with you

41
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,159
because uh we see that you are also

42
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:33,439
a language enthusiast and you like a lot

43
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,360
the simplicity and the

44
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:37,039
elegancy of the language is that it's

45
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:40,000
elegant and it's a really

46
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,560
small syntax we can write the syntax in

47
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,040
a

48
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,040
in a postcard and it has a simple but

49
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:47,280
powerful object model

50
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,040
this is the whole syntax of arrow sorry

51
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,759
some of the details will not be able to

52
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,119
be seen

53
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:56,159
but this is it this is the full syntax

54
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:59,840
we only have these

55
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:02,960
and with this we have a a pretty

56
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:06,000
nice object model on top of it basically

57
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:08,478
a dynamically type system

58
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,038
where everything is an object everything

59
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,760
is an instance of a class and the class

60
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:14,958
also

61
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:16,879
uh are objects also we have our all

62
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:19,599
methods are public

63
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:20,239
we don't have the idea of private

64
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:22,319
methods

65
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:24,640
they are virtual so they are

66
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:26,238
automatically

67
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:29,040
executable from the subclasses and we

68
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:31,680
can have override without caring at all

69
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,959
all attributes are protected for us and

70
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,760
we are using a

71
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:36,560
single inheritance and with a small

72
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,679
asterisk

73
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,000
there that i will talk later a pharaoh

74
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,480
is

75
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,080
fully writing itself in itself all the

76
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,879
the pharaoh is bootstrapped from the

77
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,519
sources

78
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:48,319
even the the virtual machine is mostly

79
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:51,440
writed

80
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:52,879
in a subset of a of a small talk a

81
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,760
subset of pharaoh

82
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:56,720
and we can modify everything in the in

83
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:00,480
the language

84
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:02,959
itself in the uh runtime even during we

85
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:05,440
are executing it so it's so flexible to

86
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:07,200
to change or improve it or even destroy

87
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:09,680
it

88
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,119
pharaoh also is highly immersive what we

89
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:14,080
want to say with this

90
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,920
that in a photo nothing is a black box

91
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,680
you can check the code of all the metals

92
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,839
modify them and

93
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,440
improve it or do it worse but the

94
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,920
important thing is that we can always

95
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,959
learn

96
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:26,640
from that and get new new ideas

97
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:28,480
it's fully inspectable we can check all

98
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,798
the objects in the in the

99
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,399
image all the objects in the memory and

100
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:33,200
we can change it them and they have a

101
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,560
lot of

102
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,560
reflective api to modify

103
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,840
also you can as you can interact with

104
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,879
all the objects and classes and methods

105
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:46,000
are also objects

106
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:49,120
you can extra take a class and inspect

107
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:52,080
it or modify or send messages to

108
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:55,040
modify it in your in your program and

109
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,959
doing a nice reflective things

110
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,480
as i told you before we only have

111
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:01,599
objects and messages

112
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:04,480
it's a real pure object-oriented

113
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:05,040
world and everything that we have in the

114
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,319
system

115
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:11,200
are based in in objects and we use a lot

116
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:11,839
the polymorphies to to implement the

117
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,399
stuff

118
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,280
for example if we want to implement node

119
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,680
we have

120
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,680
a false node it should return true and

121
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:22,160
through node should return false

122
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,120
we let the receiver decide we will use

123
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:27,440
it doing

124
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:27,440
a polymorphism so

125
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,600
for example when you we will have three

126
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,639
classes one for the whole boolean with

127
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,400
the common behavior

128
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,560
but one for false and one for true

129
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:39,198
because as every object

130
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,880
even true and false are instances of a

131
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:42,479
class the behavior of true and false and

132
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,320
interrespective classes

133
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:46,479
and this is the implementation and this

134
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:48,880
is not just a theoretical thing

135
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:49,599
if you check the in the system if you

136
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,280
inspect the

137
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,720
the methods and check the source code of

138
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:55,840
them and to modify

139
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:59,520
this is implementation so

140
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:02,638
with this uh not much much

141
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:04,240
concept we have a very powerful language

142
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:06,160
and environment that basically

143
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,080
it does not have a lot of the things

144
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,759
that we see in many object-oriented

145
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,120
languages or mainstream object-oriented

146
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:12,960
language

147
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,800
because for example we don't need the

148
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,560
idea of constructor because basically a

149
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,840
constructor for us is sending a message

150
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,960
to a well-known object

151
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:22,400
usually a class or well we need a

152
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,080
nodetype declaration as this other

153
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:27,280
analytica tip

154
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:29,758
oh sorry dynamically tip a language

155
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,638
we don't need interfaces or type

156
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:32,880
factories or

157
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:33,759
or different solutions but because of

158
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,800
the type

159
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:38,880
system we are using the idea of having

160
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,400
different visibilities for us is not

161
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,840
important because basically

162
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,599
we want to give the power to the

163
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,359
developer and if the developer want to

164
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,360
send a message

165
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,120
should be able at the end is the

166
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,240
responsible or not for breaking or

167
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:53,360
making the things

168
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:55,120
work also a nice things that we have in

169
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,600
pharaoh is that as we have

170
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,680
everything as an object we have the idea

171
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,560
of customizing the representation of

172
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,759
subjects

173
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:07,680
and have nice inspectors on top of it

174
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:09,039
basically what we can do on many

175
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,520
on all the objects is that we can

176
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:13,919
execute code directly

177
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,960
interactively and with this see the

178
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:16,880
different results

179
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,318
and for example we can take and

180
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:21,280
reimplement how

181
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:23,360
every object is visualized and it's so

182
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,400
easy of doing this that we can for

183
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,039
example

184
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:28,638
integrate with a powerful visualization

185
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:29,599
framework that we have that is called

186
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:32,000
rosa

187
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,440
and we say okay for this object we will

188
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,919
represent it in this way

189
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,560
or we will have the represented as an

190
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:39,599
array

191
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:43,120
at the end the matrix q is an array of

192
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:46,400
rise but we can implement it in

193
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:49,360
more beautiful things or for example

194
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,400
if you inspect a directory there is an

195
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,720
is implemented

196
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,638
way of presenting it as an explorer of

197
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,360
this directory and for example for if

198
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:58,560
you

199
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:59,199
inspect one file reference that is an

200
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,160
image

201
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:03,759
it just shows the the image in the

202
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,759
inspector

203
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:06,800
this also goes for all the objects that

204
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,120
we have and

205
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,000
objects that are not usually accessible

206
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,400
for example

207
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,039
in this one we are implant we are

208
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,120
inspecting

209
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:16,479
a method from a method dictionary in the

210
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,280
class one of the methods that we'll

211
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:20,639
execute

212
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:22,318
when we are executing

213
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:23,759
it or sending messages to instance of

214
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:25,919
the hand dice handle

215
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:28,400
so they will have this implementation of

216
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:30,639
plus from the compile method we are

217
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,758
inspecting we have many views but one is

218
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:34,800
to see the

219
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:37,039
the ast node and as

220
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,720
this is an hd node someone has took the

221
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:40,240
time and say okay i will do an

222
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,560
extension but every time you are

223
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,599
inspecting the ist node i will provide a

224
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,599
new view

225
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:47,440
that just shows the source code of the

226
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:49,919
method and highlights the

227
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:52,000
the node that you are selecting this

228
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:55,440
gives a lot of powerful to

229
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,960
this is get a lot of power to open the

230
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,960
system and create new

231
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:00,400
new visualization and new tools in an

232
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:03,520
easy way

233
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:07,120
because as we are developers we

234
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:09,198
we think a lot about how to have faster

235
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,759
development process and one thing that i

236
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:14,479
really love on pharah

237
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:15,599
a live programming environment you can

238
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:18,639
basically

239
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:20,960
developing the debugger

240
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:22,960
this is our base device where you can

241
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:24,638
execute go and do debugger stuff but

242
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,198
also you can come here and modify this

243
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:26,879
method

244
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:28,879
and once you modify the method it will

245
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,080
recompile the method and you can restart

246
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:31,840
the execution from there

247
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,439
if you recompile the method of course it

248
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,718
will restart from the beginning of the

249
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:38,320
method it will

250
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:39,680
not do the analysis to see the changes

251
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:43,120
and restart in the middle

252
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:45,359
but it's powerful enough to do a real

253
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:48,160
nice tdd experience because you can

254
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,040
really create the test and let all the

255
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,120
other methods

256
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,079
empty and you start debugging it until

257
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,040
and you provide the

258
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:57,040
the smallest solution possible a nice

259
00:08:55,040 --> 00:09:00,079
other thing that we have

260
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:01,680
is that this debugger is basically as

261
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,760
moldable as everything else in the

262
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:05,439
system so for example

263
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:07,200
one of the users of arrow has

264
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:11,519
implemented

265
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:11,519
using the same debugger a divider that

266
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:16,320
this is a language called vienna if i

267
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,080
don't remember i remember well

268
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,920
and they have implemented an interpreter

269
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,760
in faro but debugging that the

270
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,599
debugging the interpreter is boring and

271
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:25,920
takes a lot of work so they have

272
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,880
created a debugger on top of the

273
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:29,760
debugger to

274
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,480
debug the the language of the

275
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,680
interpreter

276
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:36,320
so this ability to create new new tools

277
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,880
and to inspect objects we can do it not

278
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,839
only

279
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:40,480
for developing the pharaoh itself and

280
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,040
tools

281
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,519
for pharaoh but also we do it or we try

282
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,599
to

283
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:46,959
sell to you and to everyone that live

284
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,959
programming

285
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:51,199
can be something that we can do

286
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:53,439
everywhere and we can do it in web apps

287
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,480
sockets application application using

288
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:58,720
sockets uh

289
00:09:54,480 --> 00:10:02,560
iot applications and anywhere

290
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:05,600
basically our goal as a as a community

291
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:06,640
is basically is generate uh the tools or

292
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,920
generate the

293
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:13,360
the small layers where you can invent

294
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:16,560
your own future or you can provide a

295
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:19,120
new business ideas or new research ideas

296
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:23,279
and produce innovation and produce new

297
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:26,880
nice things of that basically we are

298
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:29,279
aware that or we want you to to make a

299
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,640
successful life of programming in faro

300
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:33,439
and be also fun

301
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,480
of it or both at the same time and the

302
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,800
idea is to

303
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,680
provide a powerful language and

304
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:41,199
environment

305
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:43,599
where we can do innovative things

306
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:45,360
to that one of the things that are more

307
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,519
to me is more

308
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,360
produced more proud is the community of

309
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:52,480
pharaoh we are a really nice

310
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:55,760
community a faro

311
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,720
and all the tools are used by a lot of

312
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:59,920
research groups

313
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:01,600
all over the world a lot of different

314
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:05,120
places from

315
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:08,560
latin america in north america

316
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:10,880
and africa in asia a lot well in europe

317
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:12,880
but all over the world and it's very

318
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:16,399
very nice to see that

319
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:18,640
we have a lot of teachers giving classes

320
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:20,640
uh object-oriented introductory course

321
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:23,279
advanced reflective course and

322
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,920
different usually object-oriented

323
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:27,120
courses

324
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:30,240
in faro all over the world so

325
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:32,880
it's very nice uh also

326
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:34,720
these pro different professors and all

327
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:37,839
the community has produces a lot of

328
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:40,560
open source books that are available to

329
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:42,079
to anybody to download to produce new

330
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:45,359
content to take it destroy

331
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:48,239
it do whatever they want i also

332
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,200
we have a very nice tool that is an open

333
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,440
mooc

334
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:53,279
is not only available for everyone but

335
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:55,120
also is open source you can access the

336
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:56,880
video you can access the presentations

337
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,240
the material whatever you want you can

338
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:01,680
change it you can use it

339
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:04,399
in your lessons or just for fun

340
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,800
uh one nice thing that we have and now

341
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:08,560
is

342
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:11,359
more active usually here used to be a

343
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:13,599
slide talking about the the mailing list

344
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:16,639
but now the mailing list is

345
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:18,480
is so far away because in the the nice

346
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:18,959
things happens in discord there is much

347
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:23,279
more

348
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:26,959
nicer communication where we interact

349
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:29,760
more dynamically and it's very

350
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:31,518
very nice and it's a good place for

351
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:33,600
beginners and also for

352
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:36,480
experts and just to to talk and

353
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:40,320
sometimes only to to hang out

354
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:43,839
also we have a set of different

355
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:46,079
publications that we try to do

356
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:47,600
almost regularly it's difficult because

357
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:51,040
it takes time to do things

358
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:53,519
nice but we try to to continue producing

359
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:57,199
material all the time

360
00:12:53,519 --> 00:13:00,480
basically we are not alone in the world

361
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:01,680
basically this all this is a part of a

362
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:05,040
big community we

363
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:08,399
are we have a lot of companies

364
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:10,240
and universities and research institute

365
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:11,519
that they are using far awesome to

366
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,959
produce

367
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:15,519
pure research some to produce

368
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:17,518
application research

369
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:19,360
but also a lot of companies that they

370
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:22,720
use it for because

371
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:25,040
it's good for the productivity

372
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,959
we have a lot of many success stories

373
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:30,240
but it will take a lot of time

374
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:33,518
and from commercial applications

375
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,920
or to research applications applications

376
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:36,160
uh

377
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:37,360
for mobile mobile for applications on

378
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:39,760
iot or

379
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:41,519
simple web or complex web applications

380
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:43,760
as you

381
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:44,880
want to see um the most important thing

382
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:47,760
for me is

383
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:49,360
that photo it's open it's available you

384
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:52,720
can use it you can hack it you can

385
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:55,040
break it you you can do

386
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,560
whatever you want basically to me it's

387
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:59,839
very addictive

388
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:03,680
but maybe you like it or not

389
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:06,000
well we are we have all our source code

390
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:07,279
in github we you can check all the

391
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
things that we have there the

392
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:11,279
it's always distracted from from the the

393
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,680
call and we have a

394
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:14,880
an ici process that is trying to build

395
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:17,359
all the time

396
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:18,800
far from scratch and see when we when we

397
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:22,480
break it

398
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:26,079
so well this is all my my presentation

399
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:29,360
i hope you you like it and well

400
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:31,519
i'm open to two questions and and if not

401
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:34,000
you can pass through our stand

402
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:37,120
in the k building and we can talk longer

403
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,120
longer and take office

404
00:14:42,279 --> 00:14:44,880
obviously

405
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,320
we have a few minutes for questions and

406
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,439
the next speaker can also come and set

407
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,279
up

408
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,040
yes so one thing i'm wondering about is

409
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:53,519
the bootstrap important problem where

410
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:54,719
for instance when you say okay if i have

411
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:56,880
integers

412
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,560
then every integer is itself an object

413
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:00,959
and if i do addition then i send the

414
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:03,199
message to that object with the other

415
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:04,719
object that you add to it in the

416
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:06,399
information of the message

417
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:08,560
but at some point under the hood you

418
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:10,000
really do want to add those two numbers

419
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:13,359
on your actual computer

420
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,079
well actually yes uh the question was uh

421
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,440
how it

422
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:17,839
solves the problem for example when

423
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,720
adding two different integers at the end

424
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:21,360
someone has to

425
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,160
to execute it in the in the machine and

426
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,959
produce the

427
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:27,120
the sum basically what we have is as

428
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:28,959
many other

429
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,480
languages using virtual machine we have

430
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:32,479
at the end a layer of

431
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:34,079
primitives we tried that this layer of

432
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,560
primitive is the smallest as possible

433
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:38,560
but for example adding two

434
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:40,079
integers or adding two floats we will

435
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:41,920
require to have a primitive

436
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:45,359
the same when we want to send a message

437
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:47,519
for example we try to reduce it

438
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,959
and even in some of the cases if you

439
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:51,040
when we have primitives

440
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:52,000
you can check the code and you see the

441
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:55,199
fallback code

442
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:58,480
because for example for us uh adding two

443
00:15:55,199 --> 00:16:01,680
integers it can be done all in faro is

444
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:03,680
com is many orders of magnitude slow and

445
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,239
lower than doing directly but it can be

446
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,319
done

447
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,360
so you can see in the in the primitive

448
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:10,240
execution

449
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:11,040
invocation the code the small talk code

450
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,440
that can be

451
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:14,319
replaced in that and the idea is it's

452
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,720
also that

453
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,920
with the time starting to see okay this

454
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,399
primitive we want to

455
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:21,920
show at least how it could be done in

456
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:23,199
small talk or which is the equivalent

457
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:33,279
small talk code that

458
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:33,279
should work
