1
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:16,160
sorry about that

2
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,680
okay so let's try it again hello my name

3
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,119
is matthias kushner i work for free

4
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,039
software foundation europe

5
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:22,960
and i'm here today to talk with you

6
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:24,080
about the core values of software

7
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,560
freedom

8
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,680
before we start i would like to get some

9
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,560
feeling

10
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:31,679
about the values here in this room of

11
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,719
you

12
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:38,480
so i would like to ask you the question

13
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:41,120
three first

14
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,718
who here thinks that governments your

15
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:47,680
government's military

16
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:47,680
should not operate in other countries

17
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:54,960
okay thank you then the next question

18
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,239
who here thinks that it should be

19
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,680
mandatory

20
00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:03,440
that you should be vaccinated

21
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:06,720
okay and now the last question

22
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:09,039
which is a religious question and

23
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,320
i was told i shouldn't do that but well

24
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:13,920
i still do it

25
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:15,279
so uh who of you thinks that emacs is

26
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,240
the best editor

27
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,240
or operating system

28
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,039
okay

29
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:27,280
i think there are some tendencies but

30
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:29,279
beside that it was quite diverse from

31
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:32,880
what i saw here

32
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:34,240
so when we talk about the values of a

33
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:38,079
movement it's good to

34
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:41,679
look where this movement is coming from

35
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:44,720
so in the beginning of computing

36
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:46,799
when you got a computer you also got

37
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,158
the source code you could do with the

38
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:49,840
software whatever you wanted to do

39
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:53,439
nobody was there and cared

40
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:55,759
what you do with it then over the time

41
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:56,479
companies realize that they can make a

42
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:00,079
profit

43
00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:03,200
by restricting access to the source code

44
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:06,798
and by restricting who can do what

45
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:08,160
or what not so and this got established

46
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:11,760
more and more

47
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:14,480
till then in the early 1980s

48
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:16,399
this restriction triggered the start of

49
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,920
the glue project

50
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,760
and the creation of the free software

51
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:22,879
foundation and they

52
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:24,959
defined again what software users should

53
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:28,160
be allowed to do

54
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:28,959
and they came up with this definition

55
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,599
here

56
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:33,120
with those points they said that every

57
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:35,040
user of software

58
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,120
should be allowed to use it for any

59
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,879
purpose

60
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,720
that everybody should be allowed to

61
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:42,560
study how it works

62
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,879
and understand what those things are

63
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:47,280
doing around us

64
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:48,319
and that you can share the software

65
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,360
again with others

66
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:52,640
modified or not modified and that you

67
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,720
can always make

68
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:56,799
improvements to the software that you

69
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:59,040
can change it

70
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,920
so they noted that down a little bit

71
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:04,159
like the

72
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:07,200
defining what was the uh the um

73
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:08,560
the normal uh behavior before explaining

74
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,679
that's what they want to do and they

75
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,599
started

76
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,200
to write software and make sure that

77
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:16,319
everybody gets software

78
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:18,720
um under those under those terms

79
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:19,839
now sometime later there were also other

80
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:23,040
organizations

81
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:25,760
they also explained um what software

82
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,079
what what users should be allowed to do

83
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,640
um

84
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:31,360
it's 10 points i can't remember 10

85
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:34,958
points i can remember four points

86
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,959
in the end it's the same thing

87
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:41,519
when you think about it what is this

88
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:44,319
some people call it a car some people

89
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:47,120
say it's a mini others say it's a bmw

90
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:47,760
some people might call it a vehicle or a

91
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,319
computer

92
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,920
on four wheels however they call it it's

93
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:54,480
the same thing

94
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:56,319
it highlights different aspects of it

95
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,439
certain values which are connected are

96
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:00,879
highlighted higher

97
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:03,920
like the brand or what it does or

98
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:03,920
how you would like to

99
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,480
to be seen by others and the same is

100
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:10,238
true for those other terms

101
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,760
which around every software so you can

102
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:14,000
say free software you can say open

103
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:16,079
source library software combine them

104
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,839
in the end it's the same software i'm

105
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,799
talking about here so when i say free

106
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:20,798
software

107
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:22,078
in this talk it's the same as when

108
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:23,120
someone else is saying open source

109
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,400
software or

110
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,800
most other people say open source

111
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,799
software

112
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:32,239
so now

113
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,080
there was this movement and they started

114
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,600
to write software

115
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,120
allowed people to use study share and

116
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,639
improve it

117
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,720
now there were some people coming to

118
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:44,320
this movement and they

119
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:47,440
misunderstood some things so

120
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:48,320
one part was often that people

121
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,960
understood

122
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:52,800
that in this movement we care about that

123
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,320
the software is available for everyone

124
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:57,600
without any cost

125
00:04:54,320 --> 00:05:00,159
so that you can have creative software

126
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:02,160
and they thought that that's one of the

127
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,000
the values which is connected there

128
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,160
everybody should get it without having

129
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,759
to pay for it

130
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,080
so that's also why from time to time we

131
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:13,600
get

132
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:16,000
emails or people ask us oh there's

133
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,840
someone violating the principles of free

134
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,199
software

135
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:23,119
they ask for money when you want to

136
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:26,080
download it so it can't be free software

137
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:27,680
also in app stores they say well if if

138
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,120
you have to pay for this app it cannot

139
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:32,560
be free software i have to

140
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:34,560
check and find another app

141
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,639
the free software movement it's not

142
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,880
about money

143
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:41,199
you can make money with this software

144
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:43,199
you can share it with others

145
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:45,039
you can ask for money for that you can

146
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,880
also share with others

147
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:48,560
not ask for money for it give it away

148
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:51,360
greatest so

149
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:53,199
the money part is nothing which defines

150
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,960
the values of this movement

151
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:57,120
there are many people in here who make

152
00:05:54,960 --> 00:06:00,880
money with it there are others who do it

153
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:03,039
and don't want to have money for it

154
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,039
now

155
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:09,359
other people thought that because some

156
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:12,318
prominent

157
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,199
examples in free software are handled by

158
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:16,800
that that

159
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:19,120
every with free software everybody needs

160
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,800
to be able to participate

161
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,400
and everybody needs to be able to become

162
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,479
part of the group

163
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,960
of people developing something so that

164
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:30,240
you have an open development model

165
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:32,400
and that's something which is sometimes

166
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,840
happening with free software

167
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,198
but you are not forced to do that and

168
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,400
there are many examples where this is

169
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:39,759
not the case

170
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:41,758
so with free software we don't

171
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:44,400
tell people how they should develop the

172
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:46,400
software and with whom they should do it

173
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,679
it's absolutely fine if you sit at home

174
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,758
in your basement

175
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:52,000
you write software you don't listen to

176
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:53,680
anyone don't pick up the phone

177
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,199
when someone wants to talk to you you

178
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,199
don't listen to them

179
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:58,720
and you ship the software sell it to

180
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:00,560
someone else

181
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,720
give them all the rights associated with

182
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,560
it the source code

183
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,919
and yes it's free software and it's

184
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,199
absolutely fine to do that with free

185
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:09,198
software

186
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:11,680
while on the other hand it is also

187
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:14,400
possible that there are 15

188
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:16,080
universities around the world which are

189
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:18,159
developing software all together

190
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:20,080
and students can also participate

191
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,960
professors can participate

192
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:25,359
but the software says it's just for

193
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:27,198
academic purposes

194
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,960
so it's violating one of the other

195
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:31,039
values but it's an open development

196
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:33,359
model

197
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:35,280
also in free software we see that

198
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,000
sometimes those development models they

199
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,719
change

200
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,639
so people something complain someone is

201
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,880
violating the principles of

202
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:44,400
of the software freedom movement they

203
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,800
they published the source code before

204
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,318
and now

205
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,639
we haven't heard from them for six

206
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:48,639
months

207
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:53,919
it's possible that

208
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:55,599
people who develop free software that

209
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:56,240
they from time to time focus on other

210
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:57,759
tasks

211
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,840
and during that time they don't listen

212
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:03,120
to others and they just

213
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:03,840
do uh they make sure they can ship a new

214
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,199
product

215
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,638
and during that time they don't listen

216
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:08,080
to any feedback and they don't want to

217
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:09,680
have anyone else in their group

218
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,359
and afterwards that might change again

219
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,680
or they decide yeah that

220
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,560
maybe they can write better software if

221
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,879
they don't

222
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,240
ask for feedback by others that's all

223
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:18,879
possible with free software free

224
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,199
software

225
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:23,599
is not deciding about the development

226
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:23,599
model

227
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:29,198
now

228
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,400
another thing that happened over the

229
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:34,479
time was

230
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:37,838
that people said that they

231
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:40,399
or wanted to introduce other beliefs

232
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:40,959
other values to free software as well so

233
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:43,360
we saw

234
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:46,239
before it was that you should be able to

235
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:48,399
use study share and improve the software

236
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,600
and then there were others who said like

237
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:52,480
yeah but there's

238
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,680
one other thing we should add there to

239
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:57,519
make sure that this is

240
00:08:53,680 --> 00:09:00,239
something which i which i value so

241
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:01,279
one prominent example of this is that um

242
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,920
there were people

243
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:04,959
who said that free software should not

244
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:08,240
allow

245
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:10,479
military use by the military

246
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,720
because we don't want that the software

247
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:16,399
we are writing

248
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:18,880
that this is used to kill people

249
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:20,959
and this i picked this example because

250
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:24,720
there was a lot of discussion about this

251
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:27,119
in the in the free software movement so

252
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,920
first of all one of the questions which

253
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:31,120
came up

254
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:34,640
was when there are people

255
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:38,560
who want to kill other people

256
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:42,319
will they care about what values we have

257
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:42,319
defined in our software licenses

258
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:47,440
so if someone is violating some other

259
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:49,519
principles of human behavior

260
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,440
will they care about what we write down

261
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:54,640
there that was something which was

262
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:56,959
a question there if that's a useful

263
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:59,199
useful tool to achieve that the other

264
00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:03,040
question which popped up there was

265
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:07,279
what does it mean military use

266
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:09,279
so a pickup truck

267
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:11,120
is it military use if you use free

268
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,839
software in there can you use it when it

269
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,640
says no

270
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:16,800
no military is allowed to use it if you

271
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:18,480
mount a machine gun on it

272
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,880
you will see many conflicts around the

273
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:24,480
world where this is used

274
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:26,959
similar to a tank so

275
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,839
how far will you go there what how how

276
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:30,560
will you

277
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:32,800
how will you define this it's a just a

278
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:34,399
difficult question how far this is going

279
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,880
does it also mean the company which is

280
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:36,560
uh

281
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:38,800
which is producing those cars is not

282
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:40,719
allowed to use the software anymore

283
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,719
and so there are many challenges there

284
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,399
to to think about how

285
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,399
how to do this right if you want to

286
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:47,680
accomplish it that that this is not

287
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:50,079
happening

288
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:52,000
and one other important thing which we

289
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:54,399
realized in this debate was

290
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,920
that depending on where you're coming

291
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:59,519
from

292
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:00,800
you have a different opinion about that

293
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:03,839
so there are countries where the

294
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:07,199
military is mainly focused on

295
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:09,920
firing guns firing tanks and so on

296
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:12,839
there are countries where the military

297
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:16,560
is responsible in case of

298
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:19,680
catastrophes floods fires

299
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:20,319
they uh i mean when you see big burning

300
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,599
uh

301
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:25,279
woods of um forests

302
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,040
there might the military might be

303
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:29,279
responsible for that in some countries

304
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:32,319
the military is partly responsible for

305
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:34,399
for um for emergency first aid

306
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,330
situations so depending on where you're

307
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,800
coming from which

308
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:38,720
[Music]

309
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:41,279
what you experience your opinion will

310
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:44,560
also be different there

311
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:47,920
and there were also other debates

312
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:51,439
one other example here is that

313
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:53,439
people said like the question before

314
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:55,040
that soft the software should just be

315
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:58,240
used by people

316
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,959
who are vaccinated or by companies who

317
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,880
make sure

318
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:06,160
that their employees are vaccinated

319
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:10,079
so someone thought that there is a

320
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:11,910
health problem and maybe we can fix that

321
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:14,079
in inside free software as well

322
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:15,680
[Music]

323
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:17,519
the question which came up with this

324
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:21,279
example is then also mainly

325
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:25,040
how much more power

326
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:26,000
do we allow developers in comparison to

327
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:29,120
users

328
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,959
how much of their value system are they

329
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:34,079
allowed to transfer

330
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:35,279
to the users of the software and that's

331
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:37,680
a tough one

332
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:39,040
because there are way more examples like

333
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,638
this

334
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,480
and there there are examples which are

335
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:44,560
very broad they say you are not allowed

336
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,519
to do evil you are not allowed to harm

337
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:48,560
people

338
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:49,120
and many many more things about labor

339
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:52,479
laws

340
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:56,000
about environmental issues about

341
00:12:52,480 --> 00:13:01,040
animal rights about nuclear power about

342
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:04,560
genetic engineering and many many things

343
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:07,680
so think about how this could be

344
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:08,239
how this could develop in a world where

345
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,239
you have

346
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,760
so many different political beliefs so

347
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:14,880
many different polit

348
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:16,800
religious beliefs so many different

349
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:18,639
cultures where people were growing up

350
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:22,639
different education

351
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:28,320
what can happen there and

352
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:32,079
so one thing to consider here is

353
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:35,600
as free software programmers

354
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:38,000
we often like our licenses and we

355
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:40,639
we also saw that by those licenses we

356
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,199
accomplished a lot in our sphere

357
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:46,320
to enable users to use study share and

358
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:49,279
improve software in the area

359
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:51,040
the question we should ask ourselves is

360
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:52,160
if for other beliefs we have for other

361
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,639
values we have

362
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:56,880
if this is also the right tool if we

363
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:59,360
should use the same hammer we are using

364
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,959
to fix our problem for other problems we

365
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,360
have in our society

366
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:04,160
or if maybe there are other solutions to

367
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,399
this

368
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,760
how we can influence laws how we can

369
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:10,480
change social norms

370
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:11,600
how we can change markets or

371
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,680
architecture in

372
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,440
in some in some areas so that's

373
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:18,800
something we should really

374
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:21,199
consider if software licensing

375
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,959
is the right tool for other beliefs we

376
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:25,760
have

377
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:28,959
in the end till now the free software

378
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:30,880
movement always came to the conclusion

379
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:32,079
it's too tricky to add other things

380
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:36,720
there

381
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:38,319
and over the time growing more and more

382
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,320
it will not become easier because there

383
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,600
are more beliefs in the free software

384
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:45,040
community

385
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:47,120
so after 35 years it becomes difficult

386
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:50,560
to find another

387
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:52,240
joint value we have which brings us back

388
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,920
to

389
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:56,079
the four freedoms i mentioned at the

390
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:58,479
beginning

391
00:14:56,079 --> 00:15:00,239
that they are at the moment the common

392
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,600
base the common values in the free

393
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:05,360
software movement

394
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:09,600
so to explain a bit more again

395
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:12,160
that every person around the world

396
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:14,399
can use the software for anything

397
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:16,639
without asking for permission

398
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:18,880
everybody is allowed to do whatever they

399
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:21,760
want to do with the software

400
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:23,040
and that's a big thing when you think

401
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:25,040
about this because

402
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,560
everybody here in the room even if you

403
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:29,759
are not lawyers

404
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:31,040
when someone asks you can i use this

405
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:35,199
software

406
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:36,959
you can say yes absolutely sure yes

407
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:38,240
if someone asks you can i do this with

408
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:42,079
the software

409
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:44,959
you can say yes i'm absolutely sure

410
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:48,239
so everybody is allowed there to use it

411
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:48,239
for whatever they want to do

412
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,360
that's not a common that wasn't a common

413
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,959
thing before and for a lot of other

414
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:55,440
areas that's not common that everybody

415
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:57,359
is treated equally

416
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,440
and it makes sure that the users of

417
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,160
software they have there's some balance

418
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:03,839
between them

419
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:05,680
and the developers of the software

420
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:07,040
on the other hand there's still the

421
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:10,638
value that

422
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:12,719
you should be allowed to share to study

423
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:14,079
how this works so everybody around the

424
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,480
world is allowed

425
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:18,399
to understand what the software is

426
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,920
actually doing nobody's prevented from

427
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:20,800
that nobody is forbidden to get

428
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:24,639
education

429
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:26,560
how this important technology is working

430
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:27,759
we don't keep stuff secret we enable

431
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:31,040
everyone here to

432
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:33,360
to learn this and

433
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:35,120
we also allow everyone to share the

434
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,199
software with others again

435
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:39,040
so when you fix the problem for yourself

436
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:42,079
you're not limited

437
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:43,839
uh how to help others around you you can

438
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:45,439
ask for money for that but you can also

439
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:46,959
give it to someone else who doesn't have

440
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,399
money so you can help someone

441
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:50,160
who is in the need of also fixing a

442
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:51,120
problem but cannot wouldn't be able to

443
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:53,360
afford it

444
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,160
like you were able to afford it so

445
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,000
that's something

446
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:57,600
which is deep in there in free software

447
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
that you are always allowed

448
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:02,959
to help others and to work together with

449
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:06,400
others in solving problems

450
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:09,520
and you are always able

451
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:12,319
to improve software so

452
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:13,439
every individual every organization

453
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:17,039
every company

454
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:19,280
every government they are not forced

455
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:21,760
to use software like someone else

456
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:24,160
intended them to do

457
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:25,039
following the assumptions someone else

458
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,640
decided for

459
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:28,480
following the rules someone else decided

460
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:31,039
for them they are always able

461
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:32,720
to change the software to fit their own

462
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:35,120
needs

463
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,080
so my argument is that at the moment

464
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:39,439
those four

465
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:42,080
freedoms those define the values we have

466
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:44,320
in the free software movement

467
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,320
and

468
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:52,080
software freedom it's

469
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:54,640
one piece in the puzzle so

470
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,678
we have many problems in our society or

471
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,720
many of you see

472
00:17:55,679 --> 00:18:01,520
several different problems and

473
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:02,240
free software in a lot of those in a lot

474
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:06,559
of those

475
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:10,160
issues is an important part in there

476
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:13,039
but it's not enough so

477
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:15,360
you have all those different things free

478
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:19,200
software is fixing one part of it

479
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:22,559
and is fixing this i think pretty good

480
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:24,640
so we always should think about

481
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:25,678
if we want to enlarge that or if it

482
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,679
should stick

483
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:28,960
also to some of our history to the unix

484
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:31,120
principle have

485
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,559
one thing which solves one problem and

486
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:35,600
find other

487
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:39,280
tools to fix other problems

488
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:40,959
so when we look

489
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:43,520
where we are with software freedom

490
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:47,679
nowadays

491
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:50,960
there is still a long way ahead of us

492
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:51,840
there are many areas in our world many

493
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:54,960
regions

494
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:57,120
many tasks where software freedom is not

495
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,880
a default

496
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:00,479
there's a long way there for us to

497
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:04,160
achieve it that

498
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:07,360
all humankind can benefit from this

499
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:09,360
and if you compare that to other

500
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:12,639
freedoms in our society

501
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:16,000
we are at the very early beginning so

502
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:17,520
think about the freedom of the press

503
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,679
how long were people fighting for the

504
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:21,039
freedom of the press it's hundreds of

505
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:24,320
years now

506
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:26,320
and what is the situation

507
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:27,360
there are people a lot of people think

508
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:30,559
it's a good thing

509
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:32,159
to have that well let's ask about that

510
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:33,600
the general population about software

511
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:36,320
freedom

512
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,959
then there are many countries where you

513
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:39,840
have

514
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,240
software you have freedom of the press

515
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,159
but

516
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,760
it's you are still struggling to

517
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:46,080
exercise it

518
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:47,600
in practice and there are countries

519
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,159
where you had it but then it was removed

520
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,000
again

521
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:51,280
and there are many countries where they

522
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,480
never ever had

523
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:56,000
the freedom of the press so

524
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:58,080
and you have people who are actively

525
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:01,200
working against it and removing it from

526
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:03,120
from people so if you compare

527
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:06,080
this with software freedom i'm pretty

528
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:08,000
sure that the next decades

529
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:10,399
we will have to work on this we will

530
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:13,440
need more people to work on this

531
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,919
like other freedoms where people work

532
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,360
for

533
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:17,679
and which are other important parts in

534
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:19,120
this puzzle so freedom of the press it's

535
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:20,720
also one piece of the puzzle

536
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,399
it doesn't fix all the problems people

537
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:25,120
see it fixes one thing

538
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:26,080
and you need other other pieces in the

539
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:29,840
puzzle too

540
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:32,000
to live the life you envision to live

541
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:32,000
so

542
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:38,879
i think it's important that when we

543
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:40,320
when we work on software freedom that we

544
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:42,159
focus

545
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:44,000
that we get not distracted too much

546
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:45,679
about other issues around us

547
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,200
it's easy nowadays to be distracted

548
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:49,360
about all other things

549
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,640
so there are so many problems everywhere

550
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,799
around us

551
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,919
but again the same as with the freedom

552
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:55,679
of the press

553
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:57,360
like if you stop working for this

554
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:58,799
because you also want to fix this and

555
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:00,240
you want to fix another problem and you

556
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:04,158
want to fix another problem

557
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:06,080
you will never achieve any progress

558
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:08,080
with the core part of what you are

559
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:11,600
working on

560
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:14,879
so we need to focus

561
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:18,480
on those on those values which we have

562
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,480
and to give you an example here

563
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,879
i also have other beliefs beside free

564
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:27,280
software so

565
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:30,480
and one strong belief i have is that

566
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:34,080
i'm active in a wilderness first aid

567
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:34,799
group and we are helping people to

568
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:38,639
understand

569
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:42,000
how how to behave in emergencies

570
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:44,799
and i believe that people should not

571
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,240
civilizedly be injured or die because of

572
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:49,440
the lack of proper training

573
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:51,280
in this area and i join a group

574
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,960
which also values this and which wants

575
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:56,559
to make a progress there

576
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:58,240
and i'm active there also

577
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:59,840
lots of them they don't care about

578
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,360
software freedom

579
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:03,280
they don't agree with me on my other

580
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:06,479
values so

581
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,879
that's sometimes hard um you can imagine

582
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,320
i mean

583
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:10,320
you know this from other areas as well

584
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:12,000
when you are then forced to work a

585
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:13,120
little bit differently because people

586
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,080
don't agree with you

587
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,799
on other beliefs but it's something

588
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:20,399
which

589
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:22,320
i think is important that when you are

590
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:24,880
working in one group that you focus on

591
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:27,200
the goals and the values of this group

592
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:29,039
and in the other groups you focus on

593
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:32,320
those other ones

594
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:33,200
so when we are in the free software

595
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:36,240
movement

596
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:39,200
we just think about how many values

597
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:40,320
do people have to agree with to be part

598
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,320
of the movement

599
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:45,120
and to help us to accomplish it that

600
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:47,520
software freedom is the default

601
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:49,199
so how many things do you have to agree

602
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:51,600
with

603
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:53,039
when we see the three questions at the

604
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:56,158
beginning

605
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:57,760
and those three circles here we have a

606
00:22:56,159 --> 00:23:00,080
smaller group here

607
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:02,879
than we have now here in this room if we

608
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:05,520
all have to agree on those

609
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,080
so that's a challenge to think about

610
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,760
what

611
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:09,439
are those values for us and how will

612
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:12,480
they develop in future will it be the

613
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,960
those four ones might we find others

614
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,159
where we

615
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:19,600
agree with i don't know maybe

616
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:21,200
um but

617
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:23,360
one thing which is also important here

618
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:27,440
is that there is a difference

619
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:30,158
between the free software movement

620
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,480
and groups active in software freedom in

621
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:33,360
the

622
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:34,159
software freedom movement so there are

623
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:36,799
groups

624
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:37,600
which have more values than those four

625
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:39,918
values

626
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:41,199
i i mentioned and use study share and

627
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:43,120
improve

628
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,320
so we as fsfe we have other values as

629
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:47,600
well

630
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:49,840
and uh they define how we work

631
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:51,039
but they are not deducted from that we

632
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:53,600
are free software

633
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:54,960
organizations organization they are

634
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:58,399
mainly coming from that

635
00:23:54,960 --> 00:24:01,679
we are europeans

636
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:03,840
we are used to certain laws we grow up

637
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:06,240
with social norms around us with a

638
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:08,000
certain education

639
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:10,480
the the people who founded the

640
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,720
organization they had certain values and

641
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:14,400
and talked about that a lot so that's

642
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:16,799
something which is then also

643
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:18,240
of course something which is inside an

644
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:18,960
organization also it might not be

645
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,480
written down

646
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:22,000
some part is written down and in

647
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,200
constitution other parts they are not

648
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,080
written down

649
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:27,919
so that's true for all the other

650
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:32,080
organizations working there someday

651
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:35,200
they value other

652
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:37,439
things besides those uh the core values

653
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:40,559
of software freedom

654
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:41,840
the thing which i think is important

655
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:45,200
there is

656
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:48,320
to think hard about

657
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:51,200
when when to split up

658
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:52,240
so when are there beliefs that you don't

659
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:56,240
agree with

660
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:59,120
when do you have to split and uh

661
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:01,520
so that's that's a tough question

662
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:02,639
because some values they are very deep

663
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:05,840
inside us

664
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:06,640
and it's it's tough to say like uh i

665
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,320
still work

666
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:10,000
with those other groups with this other

667
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:11,120
people also they are completely

668
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,039
different from myself

669
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:15,760
and completely different from from how i

670
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:19,520
think we should we should live

671
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:20,158
but yeah i i would like to encourage you

672
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:22,799
to

673
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:23,600
before you say like let's split to think

674
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:26,400
about if

675
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:27,439
if uh if this is really something where

676
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:32,080
we have to split

677
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:34,480
for and or if we can agree that

678
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:35,199
those are our core principles there are

679
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:37,600
other

680
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:39,440
values which we also believe in which we

681
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:41,279
fulfill in other areas

682
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:42,720
which we work for in other areas and

683
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:45,600
which are not a blocker for us

684
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:46,640
to still work together with many others

685
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:49,840
to make sure

686
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:52,960
that free software becomes a default

687
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:55,520
so i think that

688
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:56,000
in the free software movement we will

689
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:59,520
become

690
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:02,640
larger way larger and we

691
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:03,360
that also means that we will be more

692
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:06,080
diverse

693
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:06,559
more diverse than we are now we will

694
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,158
need

695
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:09,600
way more people around the world to get

696
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:12,400
active in this

697
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:14,080
and it will happen i'm sure about that

698
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:17,200
that also means

699
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:19,760
that we will be challenged

700
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:21,120
and we need to continue to be respectful

701
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:23,440
and we might sometimes be

702
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:26,320
even more challenged in this on this

703
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:28,559
regard to be respectful to someone else

704
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:30,720
who has a complete other background than

705
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:32,879
we have

706
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,760
and while doing that i think it's

707
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:37,120
important

708
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:39,600
to focus and not get distracted with

709
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:41,439
all those other beliefs around us but

710
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:44,000
focus on software freedom

711
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:45,360
in this movement and care about the

712
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,640
other beliefs

713
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:53,840
in our other work so that's

714
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:53,840
my part thank you very much

715
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:07,840
thank you any questions up here

716
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:07,840
i stop there

717
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:15,919
hello okay so uh thank you

718
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:18,720
for your talk it was great so

719
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:19,440
um no system is perfect right from the

720
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,840
beginning

721
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:23,360
every system needs to change and the

722
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:26,879
same holds true

723
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:27,760
for the free software let's call it like

724
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:32,000
this

725
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:35,120
rules that you um so the 10 ones

726
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:37,200
as the time goes by we see that the free

727
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:41,279
software

728
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:43,760
is threatened by some companies by

729
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:44,640
some licenses and so on and so forth

730
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:48,158
let's not

731
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:50,399
be specific here i agree with you that

732
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:52,000
do one thing and do that well as an

733
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:55,360
engineer i think that's

734
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,480
the right way to go but we also need to

735
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:59,678
think that

736
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:01,679
we need to adapt the

737
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:04,720
the rules that we have for what we want

738
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:07,919
to achieve as the time goes by

739
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:11,279
so do you see that those

740
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:12,320
10 rules are sufficient and will be

741
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:15,679
sufficient

742
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:18,879
or do you think that at some points

743
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:20,960
once the attack patterns on the free

744
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:26,159
software change

745
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:26,159
we will have to adapt also thank you

746
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:30,879
i mean i think we we already adopted

747
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:33,679
over the time

748
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:35,360
so there were some challenges which uh

749
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:36,320
where there was some change there like

750
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:39,600
with

751
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:44,080
um how to translate this

752
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:45,279
uh this uh values in to other technology

753
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:47,120
and there will be there will be

754
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:49,279
challenges with that for i mean there

755
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:50,000
are already challenges like with network

756
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:51,440
services

757
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,200
where you have to think about how do you

758
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:55,679
translate this in this area and

759
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,559
there are some some price center could

760
00:28:55,679 --> 00:29:00,399
we maybe

761
00:28:56,559 --> 00:29:04,399
uh also add something to our licenses to

762
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:07,918
to make that easier to to uh to counter

763
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:09,840
attacks in this area there are also

764
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:12,240
also other technologies when they are

765
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:13,840
coming up like artificial intelligence

766
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:15,360
the question is like what what role is

767
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:17,918
free software playing there

768
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:19,600
and uh it's possible that i mean you

769
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:21,120
need to translate that and what it means

770
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:24,719
and it could also mean that

771
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:26,719
um to that that people have

772
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:29,440
the same possibility as they had before

773
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:32,880
with the other technology

774
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:35,120
people you need other freedoms as well

775
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:36,000
so for example you you might

776
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,678
additionally

777
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,440
to exercise the same things you were

778
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:40,399
able to do in the past alone with

779
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:43,360
software freedom

780
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:44,799
you might need other freedoms or other

781
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:47,120
um

782
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:48,399
other tools here as well like with data

783
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:51,760
access to data

784
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:53,279
and how that is handled i think that the

785
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:56,640
situation like it was

786
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:58,159
20 years ago is also on a regulator

787
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:01,760
level completely different for

788
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:04,240
for the government um what what people

789
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:06,960
are could could ask for or not there

790
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:08,399
if it's if it's necessary because of

791
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:10,399
technological change

792
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:12,158
that in some areas government might also

793
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:14,320
have to regulate to make sure

794
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:15,600
that people can still exercise rights

795
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:17,678
which were before

796
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:19,840
just being given by by software freedom

797
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:20,880
but i i think that a lot of that will

798
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:22,480
not mean that

799
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:24,640
the software freedom part will be

800
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:28,080
enlarged but it's that

801
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:29,039
we see that as a society to to achieve

802
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:31,840
certain goals

803
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:34,480
we need to add other parts in the puzzle

804
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:34,480
as well again

805
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:40,480
so thank you

806
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:43,840
up here hi

807
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:45,600
thanks for your talk so i know since day

808
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:48,320
one that free software

809
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:50,480
is free as in freedom and autism free

810
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:52,158
beer okay that's

811
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:54,240
everybody that has spent some time has

812
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:57,919
heard this at some point

813
00:30:54,240 --> 00:31:01,600
but uh very recently i had

814
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:04,640
a problem because um so there is

815
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:05,360
an add-on for thunderbird which is uh

816
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:09,679
called scene

817
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:12,639
later and uh he's the it's free software

818
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:14,000
and his developer recently put up a

819
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:16,080
kickstarter

820
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,320
because they said that since there is

821
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:19,600
the change of apis in thunderbird he

822
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:22,480
needs to rewrite

823
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:23,360
the head-on from scratch and the problem

824
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:26,960
that he was

825
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:29,039
facing is that this needs time

826
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:30,640
and the commitment that he can support

827
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:32,960
only if he gets

828
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:33,919
these donations and he was thinking

829
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:37,039
about

830
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:38,960
uh basically making this software

831
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:40,158
not free anymore because he wanted to

832
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:43,600
put a license

833
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:47,120
to use the software and

834
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:50,320
as a supporter of free software

835
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:53,360
well this was disappointing but

836
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:54,639
at the same time i see the problem that

837
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:57,840
these guys

838
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:58,559
that this guy has because he says i i

839
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:01,439
maintain

840
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:02,799
10 plugins that are free software for

841
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:06,000
thunderbird i need

842
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:07,760
to do a lot of work and i have to find

843
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,919
and only a very small fraction of the

844
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:13,120
people that are using

845
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:16,399
these plugins actually support

846
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:17,120
me through donations and i have asked

847
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:19,760
him

848
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:20,799
if this campaign is successful are you

849
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:24,720
going to

850
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:28,158
still make your source code available

851
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:30,880
and he said i i would like to do that

852
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:32,720
but i fear that if i do that somebody

853
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:36,240
else will take the code

854
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:39,760
and remove the license in part the

855
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:40,799
lessons required part and publish it

856
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:43,360
again

857
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:44,240
with another name and so and so this

858
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:46,959
doesn't work

859
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:48,399
because then at this point i will i will

860
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:51,039
not have an income

861
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:52,320
and and i cannot continue doing this so

862
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:55,360
what should i

863
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:58,720
tell to this guy to try to

864
00:32:55,360 --> 00:33:01,439
give him an answer because i want

865
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:02,960
to that this software remains free but i

866
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,679
i also understand that this is just a

867
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:08,080
guy

868
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:10,960
and it needs something to to buy food

869
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:12,240
and and that's it i mean it's it's

870
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:14,480
coming back to the

871
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:16,240
to the general question there are lots

872
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:19,279
of the things i explained here

873
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:20,720
i can understand this and i can see

874
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:21,360
where this is coming from i mean if

875
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:23,600
someone

876
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:24,879
if you are a pacifist and you write

877
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:26,959
software and then afterwards you see

878
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:30,159
that other people are killed with

879
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:32,000
your software that's a problem for you

880
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:33,360
and there might be the situation where

881
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,360
you have to decide

882
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:37,199
what is more important for you the

883
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:40,559
values of software freedom

884
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:41,679
or the value of pacifism and that you

885
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:43,760
say i stopped

886
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:45,120
writing software which might be used for

887
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:47,519
this and

888
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:49,279
you might decide that you write

889
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:50,559
proprietary software if you believe that

890
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:53,440
with this you could

891
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:54,799
you could uh rather accomplish that the

892
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:56,320
same thing like when you

893
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:58,158
when you had a business model and it

894
00:33:56,320 --> 00:34:00,559
worked at a certain time

895
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:02,960
then times are changing i mean we are at

896
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:05,039
the moment facing this this issue that

897
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:06,640
large corporations are threatening some

898
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:08,960
business model of smaller

899
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:10,399
smaller software companies and they try

900
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:13,679
to uh

901
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:15,839
to to balance that and and by adding

902
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:17,119
clauses to to software licenses which

903
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:19,440
make them proprietary

904
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:20,159
i can fully understand those companies i

905
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:22,399
mean when

906
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:24,800
you see that uh well if that's

907
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:27,839
continuous like that

908
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:29,440
the the company will cease to exist or

909
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:30,879
my employees will be

910
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:32,639
working for some of the other big

911
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:35,359
companies or or not

912
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:37,760
then that's a tough decision and it's

913
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:39,520
never that there are absolute values

914
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:41,200
in in our society you always have to

915
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,918
balance it what is more important now

916
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:44,638
for you

917
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:45,839
is it is it now in your situation is it

918
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:49,760
software freedom

919
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:53,440
or is it maybe at the moment more

920
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:56,399
on on making sure that your family gets

921
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:58,240
gets enough enough food on the table or

922
00:34:56,399 --> 00:35:00,078
that you can pay your employees

923
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:01,598
and that's that's for a lot of the cases

924
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:02,960
that's that's something you need to

925
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:04,079
balance and we have that in many many

926
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:06,000
other areas

927
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:07,520
you can be in favor of one value you can

928
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,920
be in favor of the other value

929
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:11,759
and then you see oh they are conflicting

930
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:13,520
so you are in favor of

931
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:15,680
freedom of movement on the other hand

932
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:16,720
you are in favor of better environmental

933
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:18,560
regulations

934
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:20,240
and then you see oh i cannot drive into

935
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:21,920
the city because they say you will with

936
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:22,399
my with my diesel i'm not allowed to do

937
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:25,520
this

938
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:26,079
so there's always this balance you you

939
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,520
have to see

940
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:29,280
and in the end i mean what you what you

941
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:32,000
can help some people is to see

942
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:34,400
if they can still make it work with free

943
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:37,359
software in the situation

944
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:40,320
if it's possible to do this sometimes

945
00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:42,480
there might be cases where it's not

946
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:44,400
for some time then it might balance

947
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:46,079
again there is another development and

948
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:47,280
it's possible again to to do it in a

949
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:50,240
similar way

950
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:51,920
that that's something which is something

951
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,560
which is which is changing all the time

952
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:54,400
and you

953
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:56,480
i mean what you can tell a person is

954
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:59,440
that you understand it you can try to

955
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:01,359
to see how how what solutions there are

956
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:03,200
that you tell the users well

957
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:05,279
i would like to do it for software but

958
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:07,680
if you don't give me money i can't

959
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:09,920
so i can either make it proprietary or i

960
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:11,919
can i can make it uh

961
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:14,160
you can give me you can pay money for

962
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:16,000
this it could also happen the person

963
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:17,520
makes a software proprietary and all the

964
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,880
users say well i

965
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:21,040
use the software because it was with

966
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:22,480
software so i will not pay

967
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:24,720
for the software when it's not

968
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:26,160
proprietary so you might also not get

969
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:29,279
any money

970
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:31,839
so they are that's all tough toughest

971
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,839
decisions

972
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:38,880
i think we're doing we're doing quite

973
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:42,480
okay on time we'll do a few more

974
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:43,839
yeah one more here first

975
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:45,520
thank you matthias for a really

976
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:48,000
compelling talk i have a

977
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:48,960
comment and a related question uh the

978
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,800
comment is again

979
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:52,640
thank you for telling us that values can

980
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:54,000
be in conflict with each other as

981
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:56,000
proponents of

982
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,680
free software sometimes we as a

983
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,960
community can be accused of being too

984
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:01,040
idealistic

985
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:02,640
and be too strident in our values so

986
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:06,160
when they are in conflict as

987
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:08,319
examples you said we need to be humble

988
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:10,160
and always look for opportunities that

989
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:12,400
some of our own values might be in

990
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:15,118
conflict with other values

991
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:15,760
my specific question in which is related

992
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:19,599
to that

993
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:22,160
is uh you said uh in the youth category

994
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:23,200
everyone for any purpose without

995
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:26,399
restriction not

996
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:28,000
read or agree with any terms

997
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:30,240
as somebody who contributes occasionally

998
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,160
to free software less so than you

999
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:34,240
i'm very concerned from a personal

1000
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:37,520
liability standpoint

1001
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:39,839
and i like the liability part of mit

1002
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:41,200
or apache or all these licenses that say

1003
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:44,240
you may use it

1004
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:46,640
but you may not sue me what is your

1005
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:50,160
response if somebody takes my software

1006
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:52,400
disagrees with that term and then comes

1007
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:54,399
back at me with a lot of corporate money

1008
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:57,440
which i cannot match

1009
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:59,839
and say well i disagree with your no

1010
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:02,560
liability clause i'm gonna sue you

1011
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:04,880
anyways because your software cost me

1012
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:06,560
billions of dollars in loss

1013
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:08,079
i need to make sure that the no

1014
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:10,240
liability clause

1015
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:11,839
if anything is enforced so what do you

1016
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:15,439
say in response to

1017
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:17,599
your not read or agree with any term

1018
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:20,240
part

1019
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:21,359
so i mean that that's something which

1020
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:24,720
courts already

1021
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:27,680
also had to deal with and uh

1022
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:28,640
from from what i heard the cases i heard

1023
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:31,919
the

1024
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:32,799
um the question there is what have you

1025
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:34,560
done there i mean

1026
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:35,920
it's you you wrote a software with good

1027
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:38,400
intention

1028
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:41,119
and others are using it for something

1029
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:42,640
completely different maybe even

1030
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:44,480
but you don't have any business

1031
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:46,319
relationship

1032
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:47,599
you put the software out there people

1033
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:51,200
were

1034
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:53,280
able to use it so it's a present

1035
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:54,240
and with present usually it works

1036
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:57,280
differently about

1037
00:38:54,240 --> 00:39:00,160
liabilities so

1038
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:00,720
if they use it for one purpose and you

1039
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:04,240
did not

1040
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:07,279
do something intentionally wrong then

1041
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:10,640
i would say that most

1042
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:12,720
same judges should say well

1043
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:14,319
that's okay you you are not responsible

1044
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:16,000
for that of course that's something

1045
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:17,839
which uh

1046
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,280
which will happen in any other cases as

1047
00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:21,440
well if you

1048
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:22,880
uh you do something like you you write

1049
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:24,240
an article and you think like we have

1050
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,800
freedom of the press and then someone

1051
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:27,439
comes like

1052
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:28,960
i sue you because you violated another

1053
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:31,520
another law we have order

1054
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:34,960
or another value we have so that's

1055
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:36,800
something which in the end it's uh

1056
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:38,320
if you want to be in the safe side don't

1057
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:39,760
write software

1058
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:41,839
and because the same thing could also

1059
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:43,119
happen with maybe partly with

1060
00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:44,640
proprietary software with some

1061
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:47,680
proprietary software

1062
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:50,960
so yes it's it's something which uh

1063
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:52,560
again it's it's not uh it's not isolated

1064
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:55,280
the the values we have here it's

1065
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:56,000
embedded in in a whole society with laws

1066
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:59,200
with norms

1067
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,880
with where there are challenges over

1068
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:04,480
over the time those are changing

1069
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:06,480
different different

1070
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:08,319
level of how important certain values

1071
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:11,599
are for the society and

1072
00:40:08,319 --> 00:40:13,520
yeah i think at the moment you

1073
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:14,720
you would be pretty safe in most

1074
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:17,839
countries i know

1075
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:20,879
off but yes

1076
00:40:17,839 --> 00:40:20,880
you can never be sure

1077
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,839
yep

1078
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:32,160
well thank you very much for this very

1079
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:34,560
elaborate and well argued

1080
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:36,000
uh argument of the perfect is the enemy

1081
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:38,960
of the good

1082
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:41,200
now following your argument which is

1083
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:44,160
basically

1084
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:44,960
by limiting the the set of values that

1085
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:48,720
we require

1086
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:50,880
others to share with us we can include

1087
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:52,319
more people in our group which makes us

1088
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:54,079
larger and stronger

1089
00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:55,920
now following this to the logical

1090
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:58,400
conclusion is

1091
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:59,599
i arrive at okay let's limit it to the

1092
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:03,440
very very core

1093
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:06,720
set which in terms of licenses

1094
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:09,359
lets me arrive at some bsd or mit

1095
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:11,118
kind of license which i don't really

1096
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:14,960
like to arrive at

1097
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:15,920
so how do i how do i resolve this and

1098
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:18,960
still arrive at

1099
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:22,720
uh at more like a copyleft license like

1100
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:26,240
gpl which does put more restrictions

1101
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:30,000
and and requires more shared values

1102
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:30,879
than the other ones so everything i said

1103
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,599
here

1104
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:34,000
can be accomplished with every free

1105
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:36,960
software

1106
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:38,480
license we have so that's not about copy

1107
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:40,480
left or non-copy left

1108
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:42,000
and i would also when when we think

1109
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:43,760
about this i mean it's someone

1110
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,839
some sometimes brought forward as an

1111
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:48,880
argument that

1112
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:52,319
that copy left is another restriction

1113
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:55,520
to to those freedoms or those values

1114
00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:57,119
i think it's i mean the the other

1115
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:58,880
examples i talked about they are all

1116
00:41:57,119 --> 00:42:01,680
outside of the

1117
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:02,880
of the software area there so there are

1118
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:04,560
about other values but

1119
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:05,920
what was accomplished or what is

1120
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:10,240
accomplished with

1121
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:14,000
with copyleft is that we try to

1122
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:16,479
protect those values over the time

1123
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:19,200
and that's something which in some cases

1124
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:23,040
might work in others it might not work

1125
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:26,000
but all of what i said it's

1126
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:28,640
it's not not not connected to copy left

1127
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:30,640
or non copy left to

1128
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:32,000
a license which also includes some

1129
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:34,720
patent uh

1130
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:36,319
clauses or not that that should all be

1131
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:39,680
possible with that

1132
00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:42,960
so did that answer

1133
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:44,560
your question or i mean i i i think i

1134
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:46,000
mean it's one of the challenges before

1135
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:47,359
when when it was like when there was a

1136
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:50,480
question about uh

1137
00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:52,560
um will we adapt over the time

1138
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:54,960
yeah copy left is one of those things

1139
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:57,520
where people thought about like how do

1140
00:42:54,960 --> 00:43:00,880
we protect those values over the time

1141
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:04,319
what can we do about this and they are

1142
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:07,359
already some kind of going towards

1143
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:10,800
some corner cases so if you add

1144
00:43:07,359 --> 00:43:14,078
way more it it's getting problematic

1145
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:15,440
with those other values but with this as

1146
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:16,240
they were also very early in the

1147
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:17,680
movement

1148
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:19,279
i i would say that the general

1149
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:22,720
acceptance of those is

1150
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:22,720
is still quite okay

1151
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:31,839
one more up there

1152
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:31,839
was that a finger for a question

1153
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:37,599
yes no yeah oh

1154
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:41,839
anymore

1155
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:46,640
so in that case i would like to thank

1156
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:49,440
you all for being here

1157
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:50,078
um we have a booth at the fsne booth is

1158
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:52,319
in there

1159
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:53,599
in the building k on level two i would

1160
00:43:52,319 --> 00:43:56,079
like to thank all the

1161
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:57,440
supporters and donors of the fsfe who

1162
00:43:56,079 --> 00:43:58,960
enable our work

1163
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:00,480
please also support our work for

1164
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:03,040
software freedom and

1165
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:05,040
a big applause to the organizers of the

1166
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:06,640
foster team and the volunteers here

1167
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:08,240
for making sure that we can all come

1168
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:09,440
here and share those ideas and have

1169
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:23,680
those discussions so

1170
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:25,760
thank you very much

1171
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:25,759
you
