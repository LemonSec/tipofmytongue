1
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:12,480
what is fox dot

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:14,960
fox dot is a python wrapper

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,480
we can say like that around a scene a

4
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:20,880
very powerful synthetizer

5
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:24,240
called super collider and it's developer

6
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:29,198
developed by ryan he's from the uk

7
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:32,238
and then i met him at pycon size in 2018

8
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:34,079
i saw his talk i got inspired by it and

9
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:37,519
then i prepared the lighting talk

10
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:40,559
for hero python 2018 which i which was

11
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,559
my first era python

12
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,520
then so why not just go straight for

13
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,280
super collider

14
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:50,879
why do we need a fox dot on top of it

15
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:54,399
well this is the super collider

16
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:57,519
interface um

17
00:00:54,399 --> 00:01:00,960
but then the language is is very verbose

18
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:04,239
and too too much information

19
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:06,640
um so

20
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:08,880
with fox dot you just your contact to

21
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,840
super collider is reduced to just fox

22
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:13,119
dot start

23
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:17,280
and then you can jump to a

24
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:21,600
fox dot with python like syntax

25
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:24,799
this is the fox dot editor and

26
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:30,000
the main difference from basic python is

27
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:30,000
that you can see in the first line the

28
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:37,360
greater than greater than twice

29
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:40,000
fox dot it instantiates all players

30
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:41,759
uh at the beginning of the session so

31
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,079
you don't attribute to variables

32
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:44,960
they are already attributed to all

33
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:47,199
variables with

34
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,880
two characters and then you just like uh

35
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:52,320
pass instructions to them

36
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:54,079
with uh this operator so then you can

37
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,320
give instructions to the uh to the

38
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:59,758
players and then it will schedule to

39
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,758
play in the synthesizer

40
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:09,840
i can do them

41
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:14,959
yeah super collided crashed so let's go

42
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:20,000
for the troubleshooting

43
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:20,000
um so i'm running super collider

44
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:28,640
and to do you guys get visual yeah

45
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:28,640
fox dot start

46
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,599
just check my audio preferences

47
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:39,360
because it will try to hook up both your

48
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,200
input and output

49
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,360
so i need the sound to be coming out of

50
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:46,560
my hdmi

51
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:49,920
um let's try it like this and the input

52
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:52,480
is my microphone then i need to go to

53
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:55,839
the midi devices

54
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:59,119
and check if they are both in the same

55
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:01,599
uh frequency otherwise

56
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,720
it will not work in super clyder then

57
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:07,280
now if

58
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:10,239
common start the server is running

59
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:12,560
and then i can just close this and open

60
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:12,560
again

61
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:20,080
if i list here pip list i only have fox

62
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:24,480
dot installed

63
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,480
in my end running fox dot

64
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:34,798
and we'll open the file okay

65
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,799
so bring it bigger

66
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:49,120
okay so this is a basic

67
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:49,120
sound zero just the same here

68
00:03:50,080 --> 00:04:01,280
now i have you can play different notes

69
00:03:52,560 --> 00:04:03,519
like that

70
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,519
this

71
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:08,879
if you use a double it will make a chord

72
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:15,840
but if i try to do some math it will

73
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,840
break down here

74
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:19,840
but if i turn it into a pattern then you

75
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:23,680
can jump

76
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:29,840
the chords and then it

77
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:29,840
has more than just uh this instrument

78
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,759
you have synthetics um and then like i

79
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,359
usually have this file where i have all

80
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:39,280
the synthetics where i can try them

81
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:43,680
and and see like what instrument i want

82
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:46,719
to use

83
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,720
so we can have a bus

84
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,320
and a player this player it doesn't

85
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,960
accept like numbers and

86
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:01,440
lists it accepts a string and it plays

87
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,440
samples

88
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:14,880
let's hope not to destroy the

89
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:16,639
okay so uh

90
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,960
i prepared my lightning talk for era

91
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:20,560
python 2018.

92
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,960
i put my name on the list and then it

93
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,600
gets to the time of the lightning talk

94
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:27,758
but there were

95
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:29,120
just too many and i didn't get to do it

96
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:30,800
because you just put your name on the

97
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,639
list and hope that

98
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,320
there will be enough time for you to do

99
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,720
your lightning talk before

100
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:38,560
other people do their lighting talks so

101
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:43,120
i couldn't do it

102
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:47,680
at that time and what happened was

103
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:50,080
i had to wait until europait in 2019.

104
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,360
so i was able in the next year to come

105
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:54,479
to brazil

106
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,680
and at python brazil show folks got

107
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:59,479
there on a lightning talk

108
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:04,560
and then i did the same in python season

109
00:05:59,479 --> 00:06:08,560
2018 again and then i was prepared

110
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,560
for um euro python

111
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:16,080
so here i'm putting some um

112
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:19,120
scale uh defining uh root key

113
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:21,840
some clock uh how fast

114
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,840
it will go

115
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:35,840
i have my baseline

116
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,400
okay then

117
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,479
music is not just about sounds so it

118
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,600
sounds

119
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:48,240
also mixed with silence so we need to

120
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,599
have

121
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:55,199
both so i have the durations break

122
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:55,919
so it can work then i also have my

123
00:06:55,199 --> 00:07:02,160
chords

124
00:06:55,919 --> 00:07:05,599
here but the same

125
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:07,759
they are not on the same amount of

126
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:10,400
silence

127
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:10,400
and some

128
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:25,919
some bit just

129
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:28,160
[Music]

130
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:31,039
then this is my uh favorite song from

131
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:44,490
pycon size

132
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:56,840
it's a python sock

133
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:59,840

134
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,840

145
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:12,720
thank you

146
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,720
so after euro python

147
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:19,600
yeah i was using my mask around the some

148
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,880
parties

149
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:26,480
people recognize me sometimes with that

150
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:28,880
and i got invited to to do a talk at

151
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,519
python pizza and python pizza is a mini

152
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:32,080
conference

153
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:32,959
it's like just one day and the talks are

154
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:36,000
10 minutes

155
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:36,800
long so i had to do double the job like

156
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,480
that time because

157
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,240
lightning talks are five minutes so was

158
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:42,399
that like python pizza for a 10 minutes

159
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,240
talk

160
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:46,240
and so then this time it's like okay i'm

161
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,760
going to do different i took my ukulele

162
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,360
with me i was with the computer

163
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,839
sound coming from the computer sound

164
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:54,800
coming from the ukulele i had the mask

165
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:56,080
um i had the harmonica in in the handle

166
00:09:54,800 --> 00:10:00,560
under the couture mask

167
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:03,600
and then i was also singing and

168
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:06,719
and dancing and everything

169
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,720
it was quite stressing

170
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,780
here i have the the the code for the

171
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,959
stand by me

172
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:16,560
[Music]

173
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:16,560
