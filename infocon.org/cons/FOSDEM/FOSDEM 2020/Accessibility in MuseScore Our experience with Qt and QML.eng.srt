1
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:08,080
uh so i'm peter jonas this is mark

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,240
sabatella

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:12,240
and we're talking about accessibility in

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,240
muse school

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,640
so what is musical well it's the world's

6
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,880
most popular music notation program

7
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,680
it's free open source under gpl version

8
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,759
2.

9
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,359
it's available on all platforms

10
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:26,000
translated into 40 languages

11
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:27,519
and it's written in c plus plus and cute

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,320
and we also have a website

13
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:33,440
musical.com which is home to the largest

14
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:36,399
online community of sheet music creators

15
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:37,199
and what is cute uh well it's cute but

16
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:39,360
often called

17
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,559
qt and you might hear us call it that by

18
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,760
accident at some point during the

19
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:44,320
presentation

20
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:46,239
it's a cross-platform ui toolkit that

21
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,520
basically enables apps to run on lots of

22
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:49,360
different platforms

23
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,800
it's open source under various gpl

24
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,440
licenses

25
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,000
and it offers two uh there's two parts

26
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,718
to qt

27
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,039
there's the traditional c plus framework

28
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:59,680
uh which basically adds event handling

29
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,760
to

30
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:05,840
c plus and widgets which are like

31
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:08,240
ui elements that are all ready to go

32
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,720
they look like native ui elements

33
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,439
that you can use in your application it

34
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,400
also has

35
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:15,679
a qml language which is uh sort of a

36
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,799
javascript based

37
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:21,040
uh programming language um and

38
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:22,080
rather than giving you pre-made widgets

39
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,640
like in the c

40
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:26,000
plus framework the qml gives you the

41
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,720
building blocks to create your

42
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,159
own custom widgets and custom ui

43
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,520
elements

44
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:33,520
so now we'll talk about some general

45
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,759
accessibility concepts

46
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,798
so what is accessibility well it's

47
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,920
basically

48
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:42,399
inclusiveness so designing for everybody

49
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:44,880
so in particular people who struggle

50
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:46,079
uh with a traditional interface of a

51
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,158
mouse and a keyboard

52
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:49,520
and a monitor and speakers because

53
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:50,240
everybody's different we all have

54
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,479
different

55
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,479
abilities in terms of sight and hearing

56
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:55,920
or even in terms of movement some people

57
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:58,960
might struggle to

58
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,159
use a mouse or a keyboard and various

59
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:03,679
other

60
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:06,320
different factors and one in five people

61
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,119
have a disability so it's quite common

62
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,399
and

63
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:11,360
we all know that technology is an

64
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:12,800
essential part of modern life

65
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,640
but our focus is going to be on

66
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,680
accessibility for blind people and the

67
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,920
reason for that

68
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,720
is that it's one of the most difficult

69
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:22,720
forms of accessibility to implement

70
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,800
um because we're not just sort of

71
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,400
adapting our interface it's a completely

72
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:29,760
new interface

73
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,720
that's not based on visual interaction

74
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:34,000
at all

75
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:35,599
and but it's also more rewarding than

76
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,120
other forms of accessibility in the

77
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:39,440
sense that

78
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,040
when you get accessibility right for

79
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:44,239
blind people

80
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:46,079
it you often find that it fixes other

81
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:47,840
accessibility issues in the process or

82
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,640
makes them easier to fix

83
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:52,080
and it also leads to better overall

84
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:55,518
design as well

85
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:57,120
um even for sighted users

86
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:59,920
so when we talk about accessibility we

87
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:02,840
talk about assistive devices so this is

88
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:04,559
a device that helps somebody to use our

89
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:08,000
technology

90
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:10,319
as the rest of us do on a daily basis

91
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,200
and the main one for blind people is a

92
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:12,799
screen reader

93
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,399
so this is just a program that runs in

94
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:17,519
the background and

95
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:19,599
announces what's happening on the screen

96
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,920
uh on the computer uh so it's a

97
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:24,720
synthesized voice like a robot voice

98
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:26,480
and it will announce whatever um element

99
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,319
on the screen currently has keyboard

100
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,879
focus what is receiving input from the

101
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:31,518
keyboard

102
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:33,599
so imagine if um you're on a button the

103
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:34,959
the screen reader will tell you it's a

104
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:36,238
load button

105
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:38,239
and there's two pieces of information

106
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,440
there firstly the button is called load

107
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:41,519
that tells you what it does

108
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:43,280
and secondly it tells you it's a button

109
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:44,799
and that allows the blind person to know

110
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,519
what they're supposed to do so they're

111
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:47,840
supposed to

112
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:49,200
click it maybe by pressing the space bar

113
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,799
and there's sometimes a description that

114
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,280
gives you a bit more information that

115
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:55,200
it loads the file from your hard drive

116
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,879
so the experience of using a screen

117
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:00,159
reader you can imagine it bit like

118
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:02,159
using a telephone menu system like press

119
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:02,720
one for sales two for marketing and so

120
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:05,519
on

121
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:07,120
um in the sense that uh the blind person

122
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:08,400
uh because they can't see

123
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,799
they have to listen to all of the

124
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:14,080
options before they know what to do

125
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:15,920
and um they have to keep

126
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:18,160
in their head a mental map of what all

127
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:20,560
the options are that are available

128
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,240
um when it comes to programming for a

129
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,199
screen reader the screen reader is not

130
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,680
able to see

131
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:27,520
pixels so it's up to the developer to

132
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:30,560
tell the screen reader what

133
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:33,120
elements are available on the screen

134
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,800
but the they don't you don't tell the

135
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,000
screen reader what to say you just tell

136
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,160
it what's there

137
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,080
and then the screen reader is clever

138
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,400
enough to work out what to do based on

139
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,800
that

140
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,479
and this allows the users to adjust

141
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,600
various settings like it's speed

142
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:49,199
pitch velocity and so on

143
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,720
so here's some popular screen readers on

144
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:53,280
the various different platforms

145
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,240
so on linux we have orca mac os has

146
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,119
voice over

147
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,240
when windows has a choice and that's

148
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,560
down to

149
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,919
um in the past um the built-in screen

150
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,520
reader on windows hasn't

151
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:06,240
had a reputation for being all that

152
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:07,599
great but it's actually improved quite a

153
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,160
lot in the last

154
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:13,520
couple of years so we might see it start

155
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,520
to overtake the other two there

156
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,960
another way for a blind person to

157
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,559
interact with the computer is via a

158
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,799
braille terminal

159
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,600
which is a row of braille cells each

160
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,960
cell is

161
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:28,800
a pattern of raised dots and they

162
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:31,680
the blind person reads the dots by touch

163
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,520
and each dot each pattern represents a

164
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,280
letter or a digit

165
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:37,440
the advantage over a screen reader is

166
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:39,198
obviously this is silent

167
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,039
and but also means that the blind person

168
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,440
can read it at their own pace and they

169
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:43,680
can

170
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,719
skip back and forth whereas the screen

171
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:48,560
reader just reads

172
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:50,479
at its pace um and of course

173
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,000
a braille display will work for somebody

174
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:53,120
who's deaf-blind

175
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,199
whereas the screen reader is not going

176
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,360
to work for somebody who's deaf but the

177
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:59,120
disadvantage to a braille display

178
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,560
um is that it's a it's another piece of

179
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,280
hardware you have to carry around you

180
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,240
can't get them

181
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:06,000
built into consumer devices you need to

182
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:08,080
learn braille and they're extremely

183
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,360
expensive but the good news is as

184
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:12,080
developers

185
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,800
you don't need to get hold of a braille

186
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,280
display

187
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,160
because they mainly just repeat what the

188
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,840
screen reader

189
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,319
is saying so you can test with a screen

190
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:21,039
reader and you can ask your blind users

191
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:24,639
to tell you

192
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:25,919
if um the uh the braille display is

193
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:27,919
is giving something different to the

194
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:29,599
screen reader so get feedback from your

195
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:31,919
users in that way

196
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:34,000
so how do you program for an accessible

197
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:35,039
device so if you're programming for an

198
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,440
ordinary

199
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:39,120
monitor or keyboard or so on you don't

200
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,560
do that directly that's all done through

201
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,160
a ui toolkit

202
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,000
and the good news is that the same is

203
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:47,600
true for accessibility so

204
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,759
you can use your same toolkit so qt

205
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,759
and it will in theory take care of

206
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:54,800
accessibility for you

207
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:55,520
and so no need to import any more

208
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,240
libraries

209
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,599
but if a problem occurs it could occur

210
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,160
in any of these layers

211
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:03,199
in the toolkit the framework or the

212
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,560
device and

213
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:07,360
it's not always obvious where the

214
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,759
problem lies so that's a disadvantage

215
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,800
there

216
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:11,120
so i'll give you a quick tour of

217
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:13,360
musescore's interface so in the middle

218
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:15,759
we have the score view which depl

219
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,360
displays the current score at the top we

220
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:19,360
have some toolbars for saving and

221
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,400
loading scores and adding notes to the

222
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,759
current score

223
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,520
on the left hand side we have the

224
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:24,400
palettes where you can add elements to

225
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,000
the score

226
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,159
on the right there's the inspector where

227
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,599
you can change the playback properties

228
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,800
or display properties of

229
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:32,880
things that you've already added to the

230
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,440
score and at the bottom there's a status

231
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,680
bar

232
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:37,120
that gives you information about the

233
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,840
element that's currently selected so

234
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:42,240
that's the interface for a sighted user

235
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,919
and now mark's going to tell you about

236
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,919
the progression of accessibility in

237
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:49,039
musical

238
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:51,120
thank you so um accessibility didn't

239
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:53,759
happen all at once when uh

240
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,840
we first were developing musescore it

241
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:58,000
basically was not accessible at all i

242
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:59,840
mean we use the cute widgets and so

243
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,520
forth but if you don't give them

244
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,799
appropriate names the screen reader

245
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,479
doesn't know what to read

246
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:07,199
and it'll read the value of a spin box

247
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:08,800
but nothing else and then

248
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,479
our use of the widgets wasn't really

249
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,240
well optimized in terms of their

250
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:14,000
arrangement on the screen how you could

251
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,759
navigate through them so really

252
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,680
it just wasn't very useful at all for

253
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:19,360
blind or low vision users

254
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,960
for mu score two which came out five

255
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,160
years ago we really made a concerted

256
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,840
effort and it was some clock

257
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,360
collaborations with a few

258
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,359
other organizations including google

259
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,720
summer of code where we had a couple of

260
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,960
students who implemented some really

261
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:32,959
good features for us

262
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,640
so one of the things that happened uh

263
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:36,799
was implementing

264
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,640
uh what's called modified stave notation

265
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:41,279
which is this kind of large screen

266
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:43,279
or large print editions that's not just

267
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:45,279
larger it's like scaled in particular

268
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:46,720
ways to to make it easier to see

269
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:48,959
so we had implement a lot of settings

270
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,760
for that and then just making the score

271
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:51,518
view itself

272
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,880
accessible so that you could read the

273
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:54,000
score because the score view was a

274
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:57,279
custom widget before

275
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,120
it had no accessibility whatsoever so we

276
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:00,640
implemented the ability to navigate it

277
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,760
by keyboard and ability to have the

278
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,360
screen reader read it

279
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:05,360
but still not for the palettes which is

280
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:08,399
how you add symbols to the score

281
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:10,720
so editing wasn't very accessible for mu

282
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:11,279
score 3 which just came out last year

283
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,920
and

284
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:15,760
we're continuing to improve we've really

285
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,760
taken it up a notch and now it is the

286
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:20,640
case that you can really edit scores

287
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:22,319
and we've done a lot of things including

288
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:24,240
removing the need to have to see the

289
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,839
score to be able to edit it i mean

290
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,120
if you put symbols on the score they

291
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:28,560
used to appear where they felt like

292
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,640
appearing and there would be collisions

293
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:32,239
and now we resolve those automatically

294
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,600
so you can be pretty

295
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,440
trusting that you're going to get a good

296
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,399
product just by entering the things with

297
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,920
the keyboard

298
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:39,440
and we've totally reimplanted the

299
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,599
palettes using qml

300
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,800
and peter will talk about that to make

301
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,399
them screen reader

302
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,800
and keyboard accessible because they

303
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:48,640
weren't either and we've really improved

304
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:50,959
the the navigation and screen reader

305
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:52,240
output for the score view i'll talk a

306
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:54,160
little bit more about that

307
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,680
and the bottom line is now we really

308
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:58,319
have a pretty good story where

309
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,800
blind users can both read but also

310
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:04,320
create

311
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:06,399
and edit scores

312
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,399
okay so have a look at musescores a new

313
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:11,600
score wizard which is where you go to

314
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:13,279
create scores and this is kind of the

315
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,880
best case scenario in terms of

316
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:18,320
accessibility so

317
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:20,240
we have some text input fields there

318
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,920
and they each have a label next to them

319
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:24,079
so title subtitle

320
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,279
this is all the basic metadata about

321
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:28,479
your score

322
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:30,240
and these are all standard uh qt widgets

323
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,760
and as a standard widget they basically

324
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,839
give you accessibility

325
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:35,600
for free so the screen reader knows how

326
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:37,839
to deal with these

327
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,920
text fields but there's a problem though

328
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:40,880
which is that those labels next to each

329
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:44,399
text field

330
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:44,720
are not attached to the text field in

331
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:46,880
any

332
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,640
logical sense so the screen reader

333
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:51,279
doesn't know that title

334
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,959
goes with that particular text field so

335
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:55,120
when the cursor is in the text field

336
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:56,479
it will tell you it's a text field but

337
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,920
it won't tell you what you're supposed

338
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:00,560
to do

339
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:02,240
but the solution is within qt you can

340
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:04,399
give the text fields

341
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,519
an accessible name and an accessible

342
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:08,959
description

343
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:10,240
and that um allows the screen reader to

344
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:12,000
know what they're there for

345
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,839
and and you can also use the buddy

346
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,079
system which

347
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:19,519
does allow you to link the the labels

348
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:22,000
with the the text fields

349
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:23,839
so this kind of this idea of accessible

350
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,399
names and descriptions it works with

351
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:26,160
other

352
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:27,760
widgets not just text fields but any

353
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,600
standard widget like a combo box or a

354
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:31,360
radio button

355
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,040
and the screen reader will know what to

356
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:35,040
do as long as they have the name and

357
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,319
description

358
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,480
but sometimes you need something a bit

359
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,680
more complicated and you might need to

360
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:43,519
use an item view

361
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:46,719
so this is a way of combining a bunch of

362
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:50,320
items together within one

363
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:51,920
large widget so now rather than just the

364
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,680
widget needing a name and description

365
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,199
every single item needs a name and

366
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:57,839
description

367
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:59,360
the items are not widgets this is a sort

368
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:01,680
of technical distinction

369
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,480
and it means that you can't access them

370
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,319
with the tab

371
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,720
key so you have to use arrow keys to

372
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:09,279
change uh between different

373
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,959
uh items in the view and there's a very

374
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:12,000
various other properties you can't set

375
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:13,040
on them

376
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,320
so now we'll look at something a bit

377
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:16,240
more challenging than the new score

378
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,839
wizard which is the palettes

379
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,279
so the palettes here is how you add

380
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:21,440
elements to the score

381
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:22,560
and you can see that the design that we

382
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:26,160
were given

383
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:26,719
for sighted users is a like a tree of

384
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,719
grids

385
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,880
so we have these categories of palettes

386
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:33,040
clefs key signatures time signatures

387
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,920
and each one expands into a grid of

388
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,519
symbols

389
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:37,199
and the difficulty here is that there's

390
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:38,320
no standard widget that will give you

391
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:42,079
this

392
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:43,760
appearance in qt so your options are to

393
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:45,760
combine multiple widgets to try and

394
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:48,079
create something that looks like this

395
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:50,000
you could create a totally new one by re

396
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:51,920
implementing the interface of

397
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,839
q abstract item view which is like the

398
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:57,199
base class of all item views

399
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:57,839
or you could leave the widget mentality

400
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:01,200
of cute

401
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:04,000
and try the the qml framework

402
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:06,399
and that's what we did and it turns out

403
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:09,040
it's more flexible than the cute widgets

404
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:10,959
so in in the cure in the qml world

405
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,800
everything is an item

406
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:14,079
and you're able to set its accessible

407
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:16,560
name and description

408
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:17,920
you can set whether it appears in the

409
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,439
the table

410
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,800
whether it you can reach it with the tab

411
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,560
key or whether you can reach it with the

412
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,560
arrow keys

413
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:27,359
so on the left here you can see what the

414
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:29,199
palettes would look like in terms of

415
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,279
table objects if each was reached with

416
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,959
the tab key then it would take 50

417
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:35,200
presses of the tab key

418
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:36,800
to get from the search box at the top

419
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,440
all the way through all of the items in

420
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:40,800
the palettes

421
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:43,120
and back to the top again but if we

422
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,319
make use of the arrow keys as well then

423
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,880
what we can do is we can

424
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,440
combine the whole tree area as just one

425
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:50,560
tab-able

426
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:52,079
object so now it's just four presses as

427
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:54,079
a tab key to get

428
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:55,920
uh to do a complete circuit and while

429
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:57,040
you're in the tree you can use the arrow

430
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,760
keys to navigate

431
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:01,040
so you can make things much improve the

432
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:04,240
experience for

433
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:05,120
blind users and keyboard users using

434
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,160
that method

435
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,639
and then mark's going to talk about the

436
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,639
score view

437
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,320
so the score view is the the view of the

438
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:13,839
score itself

439
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,519
and here's where we really had to think

440
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:17,360
outside the box of how to do things we

441
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:18,959
want it to be keyboard navigable

442
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:21,040
but we also need to have screen reader

443
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:22,079
feedback so the basic model we knew we

444
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,599
wanted is

445
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:25,920
if the score view is showing you a

446
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:28,720
particular note is selected and you hit

447
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:32,079
a cursor key like the right cursor key

448
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:33,440
it would move the focus to the next note

449
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:33,920
and hopefully the screen reader would

450
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,560
read

451
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,560
and uh

452
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,839
there you go i have it set on uk english

453
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,480
that's why i said crotchet instead of

454
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:46,079
quarter

455
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:49,279
all right so um the uh navigation model

456
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:52,079
we can like use a text-based model um

457
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:55,040
for this to some extent i mean text is

458
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:57,359
linear music is at least somewhat linear

459
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:59,279
so we can have characters and text kind

460
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:01,120
of map to notes in music

461
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:02,639
words where you'd use control left or

462
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:05,199
right to navigate by text

463
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:07,519
that's a measure or a bar in music and

464
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:10,399
then lines of text can we can

465
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:12,000
compare those to staves in music but

466
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:14,880
it's unfortunately not quite that

467
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,320
simple um like for piano music this is

468
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:18,560
piano music there's two

469
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,839
staves here in parallel one for the left

470
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:21,839
hand one for the right hand there's

471
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:23,040
nothing linear about that they happen at

472
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:26,000
the same time

473
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:27,760
and even within a single staff there's

474
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,560
multiple notes happening at the same

475
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,639
time

476
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:32,239
and there's other symbols that are sort

477
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:34,000
of outside of that

478
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,360
uh flow like this symbol here is

479
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,199
spanning several notes

480
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:39,040
so somehow you have to come up with a

481
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:40,800
way of linearizing that so that people

482
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,240
can understand how to navigate it

483
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,240
and so what we ended up doing was coming

484
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:46,399
up with a set of commands that just do

485
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:48,079
exactly that they linearize this so that

486
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:50,000
as you move through it it'll

487
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:52,239
know i'm going to go from this note this

488
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,519
rest to this symbol to that note to this

489
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:56,160
and then back here in a very

490
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:57,759
standardized way um in which you can

491
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,600
learn to read the score that way it's

492
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:00,959
not dissimilar to how braille might

493
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,040
linearize it

494
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:04,719
so um now that we have the keyboard

495
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:06,639
navigation happening well

496
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:08,000
we um now you need to get the screen

497
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:09,839
reader working and so

498
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,440
the the main thing you have to do is

499
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:13,040
make sure you're presenting the right

500
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:14,079
information to the screen reader so it

501
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:16,319
knows what to do

502
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:18,319
and so acute provides what's called the

503
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,440
q accessible interface and if you define

504
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,040
certain functions

505
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,800
then in theory the screen reader can

506
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:24,639
access those functions the most

507
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,279
important is to choose a role for your

508
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:26,720
widget

509
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:28,160
and this is how the screen reader knows

510
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,120
how to interpret it like peter was

511
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,880
saying a button

512
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,639
means oh that's something i can click

513
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:34,399
well there's nothing for score right so

514
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:36,560
we had to choose which widget

515
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:37,920
would fit which role fit the best and

516
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:40,160
trial and error told us

517
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:41,439
static text worked the best we pretend

518
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,880
the score is just text

519
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,880
and then the screen reader knows how to

520
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:46,560
read text so um

521
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,399
what we have to do is provide that text

522
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,920
and there's different aspects to that

523
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:50,639
you want to have that widget give it a

524
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,399
name

525
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:53,920
and then there's value and description

526
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:55,440
that go along with these widgets so we

527
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,399
are using for both the value and the

528
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,720
description

529
00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:00,079
information about the score and so what

530
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,920
that might look like

531
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:03,519
is at the end of every command when i

532
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,079
hit that right arrow key and the note

533
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:06,160
moved

534
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:07,520
at the end of every navigation command

535
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:10,559
every edit command

536
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:12,720
we run uh something that will uh

537
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:14,399
calculate what to give to the screen

538
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,959
reader and it's basically a description

539
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:18,559
of the selected element it's it's time

540
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:19,039
position you know what beat and measure

541
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:20,959
it's on

542
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:22,959
and what staff it's on but we also

543
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:24,799
optimize this for the screen reader

544
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:26,720
the raw form is in the status bar but

545
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:28,879
for the screen reader we optimize it so

546
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:33,840
the most important information is first

547
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:33,840
uh a blind user will typically

548
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,240
moving through very quickly like that so

549
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,520
they can just uh oh i heard that i heard

550
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,559
what i needed i'm ready to move on heard

551
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,400
what i needed ready to move on so we

552
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:44,320
wanted to make sure that worked

553
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,760
and to so get the important information

554
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:48,159
first and really

555
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:49,679
avoid repeating things unnecessarily if

556
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,919
you're navigating between

557
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:53,280
notes within a measure you don't need to

558
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:54,480
repeat the measure number we already

559
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,720
know what measure we're in

560
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:58,080
or the staff name for that matter so we

561
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,440
we avoid that and then once we've

562
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:01,918
calculated that information

563
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:03,200
you send a q accessible value change

564
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:05,440
event and this is what

565
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:07,360
notifies the screen reader the value of

566
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:09,200
that widget has changed

567
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:11,600
in an ideal world that would be all you

568
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:13,440
need it's not an ideal world the reality

569
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:15,280
is different screen readers choose

570
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,640
do do i care that the value of this

571
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:18,080
widget changed because it doesn't know

572
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,039
what a score viewer does it doesn't know

573
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,639
what anything is

574
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:22,799
it doesn't know what's important to read

575
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:24,880
and what's not so nvda

576
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:26,639
works out of the box an nvda is an open

577
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,960
source screen reader for windows and so

578
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,960
this

579
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,720
allows all windows is our biggest

580
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,880
platform nvda is free so

581
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,760
it allowed us to hit a lot of users at

582
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,200
once

583
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,799
but the other screen readers and the

584
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,640
other platforms they have different

585
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:40,480
interfaces different apis for how they

586
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,440
work and only some of that is abstracted

587
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:44,160
by qt

588
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,720
so we were able to create scripts for

589
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,200
orca

590
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:48,799
on linux and jaws which is the most

591
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,400
popular screen reader for

592
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:52,160
windows which is the most popular

593
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,440
platform so now that we have those

594
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:56,160
scripts there we can

595
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:58,480
now say we fully support orca as well as

596
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:02,000
jaws as well as nvda

597
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:03,840
within musescore so the bottom line here

598
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,600
is that implementing accessibility we're

599
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:07,678
not talking a ton of code there's

600
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:09,280
nothing about it that's hard except

601
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:10,720
wrapping your brain around what needs to

602
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:12,000
be done so

603
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:14,000
it's hard can be hard to find the

604
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,440
information the toolkits are great they

605
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,280
provide some information but there's

606
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,000
still a lot of platform dependencies in

607
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,918
here

608
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,679
so uh you just have to be prepared for

609
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:23,679
some trial and error there's a couple of

610
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:25,360
tools exerciser and accessible

611
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:27,600
accessibility insights will give you

612
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:29,280
some information about your score

613
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:31,039
about i mean about your your uh

614
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,240
application what the widgets are this

615
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:33,120
that's what you're seeing at the bottom

616
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,480
of the screen

617
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:37,120
and what's going to be presented

618
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:38,960
accessibility wise uh this is a link to

619
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:40,799
a whole lot of uh some of the different

620
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,840
standards the different toolkits and so

621
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:44,400
forth

622
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:46,000
i want to just wrap up by talking about

623
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,880
a real use

624
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,640
real world use case i teach music theory

625
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:52,559
at a university this is a blind student

626
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:54,080
we had this last semester

627
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:55,520
right as we were wrapping up this work

628
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:57,199
so she got to be kind of our first

629
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:59,039
really important test case

630
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,240
and i was able to create all my teaching

631
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:01,200
materials for the course within

632
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,640
musescore

633
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,000
and then print them to give to the

634
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,720
sighted students and they took their

635
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,480
tests on

636
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:08,480
paper and pencil this is her taking the

637
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,240
final exam in musescore right next to

638
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:12,559
everyone else in the class taking it

639
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,520
this way and she was able to read the

640
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:15,760
test

641
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:17,360
fill out the answers within musescore

642
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,559
and then i was able to take the results

643
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,080
and grade them and

644
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:22,158
add them as comments within the score

645
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:23,600
and hand her back her her grades and all

646
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:25,440
that and it all

647
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,559
just works beautifully and as you can

648
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,840
imagine it's really actually kind of

649
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:29,918
life-changing

650
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:35,840
so um thank you so much and i guess we

651
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:35,840
have one minute for questions even

652
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:43,840
yes

653
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:07,520
um um i guess pages and page rates

654
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:08,320
yeah i mean to some extent you you have

655
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:10,400
to assume the

656
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:11,760
blind user is maybe creating music for

657
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,799
sighted musicians because we're not

658
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:15,520
going to create braille

659
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:17,600
scores for them and so you hope that we

660
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:19,840
do a lot of good things by default

661
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:21,678
and we do but there's definitely

662
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:23,360
situations where you're going to want a

663
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:24,000
sighted person to act as your final

664
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:26,240
editor

665
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,600
to uh insert page breaks in reasonable

666
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,960
places and things like that i guess

667
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,678
that's the best way i could answer the

668
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,600
question

669
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:33,280
about making that accessible we had

670
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:45,840
another question over here

671
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:45,840
somewhere yes

672
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:53,200
yes so it's

673
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,480
it has its own cursor for some reason so

674
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,520
with all the other screen readers you

675
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,760
have a tab

676
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,639
cursor you press tab something gets

677
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:01,039
focused

678
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:02,159
and that the screen reader thinks that

679
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:05,360
that has focus

680
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:06,960
voiceover has a separate cursor and

681
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:09,520
so you can have more than one thing that

682
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:13,200
has focus on the screen at once

683
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:15,039
also it was not descriptible i think it

684
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,480
was mentioned on one of mark's slides so

685
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:17,919
we haven't been able to get it to work

686
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:20,640
with the score view

687
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:22,400
um because it's not seeing this this

688
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:25,120
value update event that

689
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:26,640
is being sent what i'd say about that is

690
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:28,799
you can issue the command

691
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:30,000
in voiceover that says read what's

692
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:32,559
selected in the score

693
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,280
but that value change event is ignored

694
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:35,600
even though

695
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:36,960
the apple documentation suggests it's

696
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:40,080
the right thing to do

697
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:45,320
and so we have no real recourse there to

698
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:48,320
understand what to do yeah okay one more

699
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:48,320
time

700
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:55,840
yes

701
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,240
linearize everything in your score for

702
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,440
you so

703
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:05,039
yes there's a lot of things that could

704
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,840
be non-linear multiple states multiple

705
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:09,919
voices within a thing multiple

706
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:11,360
uh markings attached to things we

707
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:13,280
come up with an order and say we are

708
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:23,840
going to walk that tree for you

709
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:23,840
in some linear order

710
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,960
you
