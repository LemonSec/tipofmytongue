1
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:08,879
okay

2
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:10,559
welcome everybody so just let's talk

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,519
about a story

4
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:15,040
about how we did it in our my community

5
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:18,640
without so

6
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:21,279
much uh uh if i can say trust about

7
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:23,039
that we can do it so before to start i

8
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:24,720
want to talk about a little about me

9
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,480
just to say that i have a bit of

10
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,799
experience now inside mozilla

11
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,080
the mozilla community is not my first

12
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,399
fosdem it's not my

13
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:33,839
first them a speaker i usually talk in

14
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:35,200
the modular room every time about a

15
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,800
different topic

16
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,879
because i involved in different kind of

17
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:41,040
things i have a lot of experience

18
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:42,320
inside the community management also

19
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,920
because i'm involved

20
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,600
in the wordpress community as

21
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,680
contributor core

22
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,360
blah blah this kind of things so all

23
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,160
this kind of experience was helpful to

24
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,280
achieve this

25
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,879
issue in a work of two years also i've

26
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,559
written a book about these free

27
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:58,480
adoptions about my experience of

28
00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:00,559
contributing to pursuers and this

29
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,519
talk use some of the stuff that i've

30
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:05,119
already written

31
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:06,799
so just talk about what is happening

32
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:08,159
so first of all we need to understand

33
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:09,840
there is a project about from the

34
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:13,119
mozilla italia community

35
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,600
and what is italia community well it's

36
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:15,439
kind of

37
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,360
many of the other mozilla community that

38
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:18,399
exists around the world there are also a

39
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,360
few people here

40
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,240
but you can find it online that work in

41
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,040
our case

42
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:26,798
in the for the linguistics so everything

43
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,159
that involved italian language but also

44
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:29,360
the local country

45
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:31,040
because there are communities that are

46
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,479
involved also in many other countries

47
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,880
because the language is spread

48
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:36,240
from in different countries so we're all

49
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,640
better in localization

50
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,798
support participation development in

51
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,000
many things and just you can see from

52
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,320
the photo will all

53
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,439
be together in a lot of things so maybe

54
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,279
the next year will be

55
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:49,119
your face and these delights or maybe in

56
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,200
the new york community side it's like

57
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:54,799
that you have an idea that exists

58
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:56,880
so we love to work together and to work

59
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:58,240
together we worked in a plan of two

60
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,759
years because the speech

61
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:02,000
recognition the mozilla world is

62
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:05,759
splitted mainly in two

63
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,280
steps first of all the data

64
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,919
this mozilla is doing with the common

65
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,280
voice project or voice.mozilla.org

66
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:14,319
project

67
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:16,560
the where communities or people can

68
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:19,119
unlock their language there so people

69
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,920
can start recording and review

70
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,280
sentences read it of course so we will

71
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:26,319
have in a future

72
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:29,360
a data set of deep of public domain of

73
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:30,238
any language it is a big project of

74
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,319
course

75
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:33,760
and require a lot of time in a lot of

76
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:36,799
ways

77
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:37,920
when you have the data the next step is

78
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,959
to use it

79
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:42,319
so jumping on the last part is this

80
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:43,280
speech this which is another project

81
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:45,119
where mozilla

82
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,200
is written in rust with a lot of

83
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,800
buildings etcetera i don't have to

84
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,319
explain what it is you can find

85
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,280
everything online that

86
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:54,480
just need your data to generate a voice

87
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,239
recognition model

88
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,238
now mozilla release it also the text to

89
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:01,440
speech project based on that so

90
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:03,599
you can use it in a lot of ways so

91
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:05,840
the first year we worked on starting up

92
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:08,079
the project to gather data then

93
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,560
the next year we started working on

94
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:13,440
using it

95
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,480
so what we did the first year to succeed

96
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,959
on the first goal

97
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:18,238
well we unlocked the language on the

98
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:20,239
commonwealth's portal

99
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,760
this means that we gathered a lot of

100
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:25,200
sentences

101
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:28,640
and defined it some define some rules

102
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,518
as an example how much you need to

103
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,839
belong

104
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:32,560
because we discovered when we tested

105
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,440
this

106
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,879
because we gathered like 11 000

107
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:39,040
sentences and we saw

108
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:39,920
when we did the first events about

109
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,159
recording

110
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:44,480
that we have some problems that like

111
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:46,959
long sentences because italian has long

112
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,879
words so we didn't tested them and see

113
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:50,000
that we don't have enough time to say

114
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:52,720
everything

115
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,239
so with this event the italiana can come

116
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,680
two years ago and with a lot of the

117
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:58,159
mozilla's work that we have

118
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:00,000
we put price just to get the most

119
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:03,439
maximum amount of people testing it

120
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,760
like we did i don't know for 20

121
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:07,599
recordings you will get a mozilla poster

122
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,599
the problem that we got so many people

123
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:10,959
that want to get swag that we have to

124
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:13,679
double that

125
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,879
and we finish it anyway everything so we

126
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,918
tested what we

127
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:19,759
did and we improved our rules

128
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:21,680
the next step was to experimenting

129
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,479
promotion with zero funding because we

130
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,560
are a community

131
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:26,479
we are volunteer we do something else in

132
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,320
the life so we don't have so many money

133
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:29,758
to put on that so we experiment the

134
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,000
different ways

135
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:33,919
like organizing events in different

136
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,199
cities with different people as speakers

137
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:37,599
so we can have something

138
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,400
in the ground they know better the place

139
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,600
and know

140
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,479
what is the best point to explain to get

141
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,800
some

142
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:46,080
feedback from the people to do with that

143
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,960
we did the

144
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:51,120
an italian slide deck of like 40 slides

145
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:54,080
with a lot of things

146
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,600
to just to let to the speaker to have

147
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,479
all the slides that they need as an

148
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,199
example

149
00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:00,960
i have to go to speak at university in

150
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:02,400
computer science maybe

151
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,560
machine learning this speech is very

152
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,638
interesting to explain but if i go

153
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,160
to a market space maybe that doesn't

154
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,680
care of that they have no knowledge

155
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,479
about that so we need something more

156
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,240
simple

157
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:14,960
in that way with this kind of modular

158
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,639
slides we got a lot of speaker also from

159
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:21,359
outside the community that

160
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:21,360
promoted for us what we was doing it

161
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:25,840
these are kind of examples of the slide

162
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:28,240
this is the common voice website

163
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:31,039
just to explain where you have to press

164
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:33,600
the button these kind of things

165
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:34,479
this was one that explained what is

166
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,479
machine learning

167
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:38,320
we had more of them that you have to

168
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:40,800
consider was thinking

169
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:42,479
but from the bottom to the top so for

170
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,840
any kind of audience so we'll explain

171
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:47,919
what is machine learning

172
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:51,039
the most easy way in this case

173
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:52,799
so the next year what we did well we

174
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:54,240
play worked a lot on marketing and

175
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,039
promotion because we are a small

176
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,880
community

177
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:58,719
and we need feedback italian is a

178
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,319
language with 60 million speakers

179
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,759
because this is the country so

180
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:04,000
we think that maybe there is people

181
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:06,479
outside that we don't know

182
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,919
so we tested new social tactics to get

183
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:10,400
promotion

184
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:11,280
first of all was to write a big kind of

185
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,280
weekly

186
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:15,520
uh post on the forum with a lot of

187
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,159
updates from international and national

188
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,479
about

189
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,080
common voice at the speech this because

190
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:22,639
we got always new people

191
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:24,080
joining on our channels asking always

192
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:27,039
the same questions

193
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:28,800
so we said maybe we need to save time to

194
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:30,400
reply to these people doing something

195
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,199
else because we have too many things to

196
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,280
do

197
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:35,199
and this worked very well because during

198
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:37,599
the time appreciated a lot

199
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:39,199
when we passed the new year how many

200
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:42,080
things we did

201
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:43,680
and we shared this post in a lot of new

202
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,400
plays that we never tried during the

203
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,720
years

204
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,440
like reddit in the italian subreddit

205
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,599
about

206
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,800
et world and that's a specific facebook

207
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:53,680
italian groups

208
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,479
where we wasn't there there are taking

209
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,639
to statistics

210
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:58,400
so not just developers or pencils people

211
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:00,560
we need to find new people

212
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:02,560
just to get the most amount of feedback

213
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:05,360
that we can

214
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,960
and also with the help of mozilla we got

215
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,639
the promotion inside about

216
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,239
home page of firefox there are the

217
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,639
snippets i don't know how many of you

218
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,360
use

219
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:14,720
so but there was a specific snippet for

220
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,599
italian user about

221
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:19,199
try common voices for us was kind of

222
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:22,240
incredible because

223
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:25,280
we did it in common voice in 5 months

224
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,080
10 hours 10 hours of recordings with two

225
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:29,039
weeks

226
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:30,318
with this promotion we got 40 hours just

227
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:32,639
to say that for us was

228
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:33,360
ah it's kind of incredible what we did

229
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:37,680
with this

230
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:39,919
kind of a bit of promotion very good

231
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:42,000
also we created a category on the in

232
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:43,840
this course of mozilla that is public

233
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,680
is international you can find the also

234
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,560
mozilla employer you can pay all the

235
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,400
community

236
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,560
and there is a common voice category and

237
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:52,960
also the speech and we got an italian

238
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,800
categories where to speak italian

239
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:56,878
just for us because the commonwealth's

240
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,400
website referred to this course so that

241
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:01,840
it was the only link

242
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:05,120
where people want to try to find us

243
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:07,599
and also we tested with specific kind of

244
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:10,080
tweets but not from our mozilla italia

245
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:12,960
social channel officials but also ours

246
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:14,159
with different kind of keywords hashtag

247
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:17,359
just to see

248
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,800
what was working better

249
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,639
one of the things that we did was to

250
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:23,199
keep updated slides because

251
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:24,800
time comes there are changes project

252
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:27,599
evolving so we need to update it

253
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,639
and we got the new people that was using

254
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:32,080
it and we have an idea

255
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:34,560
that contributed back to improving it

256
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:36,240
next also we created specific kind of

257
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:38,159
activities

258
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,799
for people with their own knowledge of

259
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:44,319
mozilla what works what is the project

260
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:46,240
and also with few time to contribute we

261
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,519
saw looking at the people that was

262
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:50,320
joining us

263
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:52,240
what was the most interested things for

264
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,839
them what was the most uncommon

265
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,920
background these kind of things just

266
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:57,920
understand what the people was joining

267
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,319
what we can offer just to them to keep

268
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:01,839
them

269
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:03,120
part of what we are doing the second

270
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:04,720
part was to

271
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:08,000
thinking about documentation and

272
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:10,880
planning so mainly community management

273
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,839
we define a draft in english this time

274
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,839
not italian

275
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:16,160
it is public of course like the rest of

276
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:18,080
staff about our needs

277
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,920
from mozilla and the project common

278
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:22,080
voices mainly

279
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:24,240
and we sha and we started to update it

280
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,040
this more this document during the year

281
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,040
with all of

282
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:29,199
what we did what we we cannot did

283
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:31,839
without the problem etc

284
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,720
and the same time we shared that because

285
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:34,720
it was public

286
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,480
outside the community with these new

287
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,480
channels that we found

288
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,080
again to be sure that everyone was

289
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:42,000
informed but that's to get the most

290
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,440
feedback to understand or to explain

291
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,560
what we are doing because it's kind of

292
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,680
new

293
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:49,279
or everything and

294
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:51,599
we planned a meeting with mozilla

295
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:53,839
employee that follows common voice

296
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,640
just to share these our needs from the

297
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:56,240
community

298
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:58,240
and people outside that have no idea

299
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:02,640
what is common voice

300
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:04,480
and to get answers and fixed some things

301
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:06,319
so for us was very important to have

302
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:09,600
this one and one relation

303
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:13,680
with mozilla and this is possible

304
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:15,519
also review and gather ideas from all

305
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,640
over the communities not maybe just me

306
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:18,880
or another volunteer

307
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:20,959
that say okay we have to do this no we

308
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,640
was open to everyone just to have the

309
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:26,000
best effect that we can do

310
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:28,720
with what we have a tiny community

311
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,320
and and we d we do also usually a

312
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,200
monthly video call that is open to

313
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,760
everyone and

314
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,440
we publish a youtube after the call but

315
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,240
it's open to everyone so we got people

316
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,800
that was just

317
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,440
joining them just to be to saw what we

318
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,959
are doing

319
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:45,040
just you know people and

320
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:46,560
define goals for any kind of area that

321
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:49,199
we want to do something

322
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:50,640
later when we saw our people our

323
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,959
volunteers what they can do

324
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,920
we saw the priority so just now say we

325
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:56,319
are these are the

326
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,519
the arya but just to say for every area

327
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,320
we want this

328
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:02,959
as a priority and let us see who can do

329
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,959
it everything

330
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,560
so for us was very important so that

331
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:09,518
every design decisions

332
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:11,199
was open so everyone can say something

333
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:13,279
because for mozilla we need

334
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,800
transparent we need inclusion of

335
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:17,200
everyone

336
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:19,040
and also we extended our internal ideas

337
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,440
toward the community because

338
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:23,040
we opened the trend in the international

339
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,279
category on this course to see us

340
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,719
other community what how was doing

341
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:28,000
something that maybe we have an idea

342
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,480
maybe someone already did

343
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,279
and often happens but there is no

344
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:36,240
communication of them

345
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:38,160
the third part was mommy the most one

346
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:40,839
that you are interested as developer

347
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:42,000
like me is development and

348
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:44,320
experimentation

349
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,560
first of all we created a repo that's

350
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,880
based on the scripts from

351
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:50,319
the french community of mozilla because

352
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,360
they have a mozilla employee that is

353
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:54,240
alexander

354
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,360
alexandre alexander that is watching me

355
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,959
right now probably

356
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:01,120
and that is uh working on this speech

357
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:02,160
and we've written a lot of bash script

358
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,720
and locker image

359
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,600
for to generate the model for french so

360
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,560
we said well

361
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:10,240
we can fork it change what we need just

362
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:13,680
to use italian stuff

363
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:17,040
like files corpus this kind of things

364
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:18,560
and this was by just one person me

365
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:20,560
that doesn't have so many experience

366
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:23,199
about how works this speech

367
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:24,638
i am a developer i work best this kind

368
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,880
of things but they have no idea

369
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:28,880
how good machine learning in the details

370
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:31,760
so i started just because

371
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:32,800
it was time the cool part that when i

372
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,959
did everything

373
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,240
we used uh fixed the batch the best

374
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:39,040
script to do

375
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:40,320
for italian i said to the world

376
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:43,120
community to all these

377
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,839
new social groups these kind of things

378
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,880
we need

379
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:49,839
testers when i say that a lot of people

380
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:53,600
join it on testing it on their company

381
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:56,399
web server abuse azure that are very

382
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:58,000
a cost so they just do trying everything

383
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:59,920
and contributed back to fix

384
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,880
what wasn't working what was can be

385
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:05,360
improved excited this kind of things

386
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,000
in that way we got new valid maintainers

387
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,320
more than me

388
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,360
skilled of this kind of things that now

389
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,880
are pushing on

390
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:14,959
this kind of things adso for me was very

391
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,560
important but that's so intriguing and

392
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:18,319
thrilling because after seven years

393
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,279
since the mozilla community we got for

394
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:22,000
the first time

395
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:23,680
companies that was contributing to us to

396
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,880
our projects

397
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:29,519
in this case we got patch server support

398
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:32,079
experimentation in this case the most

399
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:34,160
simple it was a telegram bot

400
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:36,399
that compared the recording with google

401
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:38,079
speech and our model

402
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:39,839
for us was really now we can play it

403
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:42,959
with something without

404
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:46,399
established speech because it's not easy

405
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:48,319
and now me because the first person

406
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:49,920
is just doing project management there's

407
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:52,639
something about the development

408
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:55,040
of this without following that part

409
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:58,959
because i want to say that because

410
00:13:55,040 --> 00:14:01,519
it's not so scary getting a model for

411
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:02,560
who doesn't have knowledge you just need

412
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:04,720
to start

413
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,839
and ask because the community specific

414
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:10,000
of a language

415
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:12,320
it's big and you can find more easily

416
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,680
later talking with our community we

417
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:16,000
built

418
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:17,839
an android app for common voice because

419
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,560
there wasn't because it's our website

420
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:21,120
because

421
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:22,399
for the kind different kind of reason

422
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:25,839
also

423
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:28,160
to spread at must we can we

424
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:29,199
did a new left left because we have this

425
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,600
repo about

426
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:33,519
in italian with the left let about i

427
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,480
don't know mozilla what is firefox this

428
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:36,079
kind of thing so

429
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,079
when there is an event but i don't know

430
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:40,079
a linux is a group in a city

431
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:41,760
and we don't have anyone there they can

432
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:44,000
printing a sharit

433
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:45,600
and we did one about common voice at

434
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,760
this speech

435
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,760
and during these years we contributed a

436
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,319
lot in different common voice tools and

437
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:53,120
projects

438
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:55,120
based on our needs on problems that we

439
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:58,320
find

440
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,880
so this was the first big achievement

441
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,680
for us

442
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,639
a fist public official this speech model

443
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:05,439
online

444
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:07,279
built in october with the docker image

445
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:10,560
to generate the model so you can

446
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:12,240
do it but in two different data sets

447
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:14,239
there are not so many hours and this is

448
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:16,959
a problem that we are addressing

449
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:18,720
but what we need to do now after to have

450
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:20,638
the model well we have the model

451
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,079
but we don't have any instruction or to

452
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:25,440
use it so we need to

453
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:27,279
do a bit of documentation also a week

454
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,320
ago there was a new release of common

455
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:31,360
voice data

456
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:32,560
so our data set now is 90 hours and it's

457
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,160
still growing

458
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,758
so we need to update the model and

459
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,959
that's with a lot of things like

460
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:41,440
transfer learning

461
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:44,000
these kind of things and testing it

462
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:46,480
a cool things was these because i joined

463
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:49,680
the kda academy in milan

464
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:50,880
just because i'm a cafe user sometimes

465
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:54,239
contributors so

466
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:57,360
i met the chief editor of this magazine

467
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:58,720
printed and he interviewed me about

468
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,720
common voice what we

469
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,480
was doing in the and the first time

470
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:05,360
after firefox first moment

471
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,000
we got something in um magazine talking

472
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:08,480
about

473
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,600
what the community was doing it there is

474
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,839
also a video

475
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,360
interview uploaded on youtube but also

476
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:15,040
in the dvd attached to

477
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,639
the magazine so for us was very

478
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,639
interesting because we did

479
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:19,839
any effort on doing this kind of

480
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:22,079
marketing just

481
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:23,519
going around for us was very helpful

482
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:26,880
because i have no idea

483
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:29,759
that i got this for the community

484
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:31,279
so what is next this year for italy will

485
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:32,480
be very important because we will have

486
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:34,560
two big international

487
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:36,000
national international events and the

488
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,638
past year there was nothing just to

489
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,199
understand

490
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:41,120
what is the situation and we will join

491
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:44,319
them with different ideas about

492
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:46,160
testing it improving etc

493
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:48,160
we will want to create also italian

494
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:50,000
videos about how to create

495
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:51,519
to use common voice because we have

496
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,880
people that always ask the same

497
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:55,600
questions again like

498
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:56,240
what is the best microphone i have to do

499
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,959
a review

500
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,440
a sentence as an example so after a

501
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:01,119
while

502
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:03,839
it's better to do a video that is more

503
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:05,679
easy to see and instead of long

504
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:08,640
documentation

505
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:09,760
also we need to do tutorials about using

506
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,280
our model

507
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,959
and we want to do it in italian but

508
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,399
there are a lot of projects that already

509
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:16,559
implement this speech

510
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,600
and release those tutorials but we want

511
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:19,760
to do it in italian

512
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:21,280
for our model that way we can gather

513
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:23,280
more people

514
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:24,959
and also get you ready for the linux day

515
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,720
because in italy we don't have the free

516
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:28,400
the software of freedom day we have the

517
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:31,840
linux day that

518
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:33,679
is usually in 70 cities in the same day

519
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:35,760
and as commune as mozilla we have

520
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:38,480
usually five or six cities

521
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:39,760
with mozilla talks we want to be sure to

522
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:43,120
extend this

523
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:45,360
our area so closing it

524
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,320
there is a long blog post version with

525
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:49,840
all of the links

526
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:51,840
as in the forum because the mozilla

527
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:53,520
employees that working on common voice

528
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:57,280
asked me to write

529
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:59,679
my experience and edit it

530
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:01,600
and it also disliked so you can find a

531
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:04,720
lot of links ideas

532
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:05,199
etc there for any question of course i'm

533
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,520
here

534
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,480
instead if you are italian want to to

535
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:11,440
know more

536
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:12,960
we have telegram groups you can reach us

537
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,960
with this both

538
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,480
in case for the others non-italian

539
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:20,240
speakers of course

540
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:20,240
i am here and finish it

541
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:32,160
do people have questions

542
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:43,840
no questions good okay good to go

543
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:43,840
okay one yeah

544
00:18:55,039 --> 00:19:00,879
how do you how do you manage variation

545
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:01,678
with languages and the example was used

546
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:04,400
as french

547
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:05,360
where when there's accent between

548
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,960
regions

549
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:09,760
and they don't use the same expressions

550
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,000
and stuff this is a good example because

551
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,080
if

552
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,760
you see the french scripts they're using

553
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,799
different data sets like also for

554
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:17,440
african

555
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:17,918
but the good part is that common voice

556
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:20,400
as

557
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:22,799
when you are registered a profile you

558
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:24,160
can set what is your accent for specific

559
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:26,000
languages like french

560
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:27,360
and english mainly for italian is

561
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,360
complicated so

562
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:31,840
in the data set is reported for every

563
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:32,320
recording is anonymous the user but you

564
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,240
know

565
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:35,520
what is the accent so if you want to

566
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:38,160
build as an example

567
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:39,120
just use common voice for french but

568
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:42,880
from people from

569
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:44,959
poor french as we can say you can do it

570
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:46,160
and what is the quality when you mix

571
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:49,919
different data sets

572
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:52,720
in this like this case well this depends

573
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:54,799
on the amount of hours more amounts of

574
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:57,360
hours you put there maybe the quality is

575
00:19:54,799 --> 00:20:00,960
better so it's kind of experimenting

576
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:03,918
this a part of a part of the answer is

577
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,240
you need diversity in the recordings if

578
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:06,240
you

579
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:08,000
listen if you participate a bit and go

580
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:10,159
to voice mozilla.org and you don't want

581
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:13,679
to use your voice you can just listen

582
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:17,600
you'll hear that it's mainly male

583
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:19,840
that are my age talking there's little

584
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:21,199
variation there so if you have a

585
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:23,678
girlfriend that wants to

586
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:25,120
participate that helps already if you

587
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:25,919
have a girlfriend that's from the south

588
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,678
with the proper

589
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:29,280
south accent that helps already et

590
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:32,559
cetera et cetera et cetera

591
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:36,320
the more diverse training data

592
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:38,000
the model has the more

593
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:39,760
it's going to be able to extend and

594
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,960
understand every accent

595
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:44,640
and not usually not talk these accents

596
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:47,440
but at least understand them

597
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:49,039
so it's about the amount of it's it's

598
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:52,400
about the volume of

599
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:54,080
samples the more the merrier exactly

600
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:56,080
one of the experiments that we want to

601
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:58,879
do is for transfer learning

602
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:59,918
use the spanish model that a volunteer

603
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:02,080
built and see

604
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:04,480
how much change the quality of the

605
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:05,039
italian one is not the same language but

606
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,600
there are

607
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:09,120
similarities and we are now in a phase

608
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:11,760
of experimentation

609
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:13,439
so we transfer learning is possible to

610
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:16,320
test this kind of things

611
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:18,159
and of course again the big amount of

612
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:20,320
hours you can put on this speech

613
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:22,240
is better the point is that you need to

614
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,840
timing everything just to test

615
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:26,080
the quality of the italian model right

616
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:29,439
now is kind of

617
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:31,120
horrible because we did it just in time

618
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:33,200
for the linux day at the time but we

619
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:35,039
need more people that can help us out

620
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,400
but you can try for french

621
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:37,679
and see what happens i don't speak

622
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,720
french i don't know the quality of the

623
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:42,080
other one

624
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:44,080
so is for any kind we need more

625
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:46,480
testing and experimenting because now i

626
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:47,600
think we are at the first steps to see

627
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,280
what will happen

628
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:51,520
the good part that is everything open

629
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:54,320
source or public domain so you can use

630
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:57,039
it for everything you want

631
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:57,039
other questions

632
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:08,960
thank you very much that's it
