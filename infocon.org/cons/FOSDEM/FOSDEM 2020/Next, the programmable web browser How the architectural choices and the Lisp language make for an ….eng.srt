1
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:09,200
okay

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,559
okay hello everyone

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:14,320
uh i'll talk about next browser today so

4
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:16,880
i'm part of atlas engineer we've been

5
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:20,240
working on this browser for

6
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:22,479
the last two years something and uh we

7
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:24,080
tried to look at uh the world of

8
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,840
browsers a bit differently

9
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:28,479
so we've been a little bit frustrated

10
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:31,279
with the popular browsers like firefox

11
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,880
and chrome or the more geeky browsers

12
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:35,360
that allow us to be

13
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,000
tinkering with the configuration and all

14
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,239
so

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,680
uh personally when i use firefox at

16
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:40,239
chrome uh what frustrates me a little

17
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,719
bit is that

18
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:44,959
i come i feel a bit imprisoned i feel

19
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:47,039
like i cannot do much configure

20
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,000
uh it's a little bit like uh this black

21
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:50,719
box or

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
or less uh you could argue that okay

23
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:54,239
there are extensions but those

24
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,559
extensions really are limited

25
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:58,879
they don't really you can't access the

26
00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:00,320
internals of the browser

27
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:01,919
they can't really communicate so much

28
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,520
between each other and they can't really

29
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,960
communicate with your system

30
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:10,000
so if you want to interact with

31
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,199
git or your text editor you can't really

32
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,479
do that very well

33
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:17,759
it's not easy so

34
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:19,439
there's that and then other smaller

35
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:23,280
browsers

36
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:25,758
then tailoring to the more geeky crowds

37
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,960
and those are usually keyboard focused

38
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:29,040
minimalist

39
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:31,199
uh you can configure them with uh in

40
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:34,000
python or different languages

41
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,840
uh and those browsers well there are so

42
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,520
many of them actually they're legions

43
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:40,240
and i've been wondering i mean why

44
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:43,439
actually do they come and go so

45
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:46,880
fast and i think the problem here is

46
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:50,000
a lack of abstraction with regard to the

47
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:51,920
renderer and really i think the what the

48
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,360
web browser truly is it's a user

49
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,079
interface

50
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,280
uh it's a user experience that allows us

51
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:58,240
to interact with the web with the

52
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,640
content

53
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:02,000
but it's not uh it shouldn't really be

54
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,240
stuck to the right brander

55
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,600
itself so we don't really i mean it

56
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,920
matters of course

57
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,440
but maybe it is not all that matters for

58
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,440
browser

59
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,520
so that's what we've been trying to do

60
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:16,239
with next browser so the the

61
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,640
key uh design decisions that we've taken

62
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:19,360
here

63
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,480
is one to decouple the browser from the

64
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:23,520
web renderer

65
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:26,879
that means that we support webkit

66
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,440
and web engine which is more or less

67
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:30,720
blank

68
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:32,239
chrome and on the other hand we also

69
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,840
try hard to make it extremely

70
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:35,280
configurable

71
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,519
because i'm a geek and i like to

72
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:40,959
configure my browser

73
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:42,640
to to the very core and i like to to

74
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:43,360
make it to have full control over my

75
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,518
browser

76
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,959
so how do we do that how do we have a

77
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:50,879
fully customizable

78
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:53,680
program where we don't only expose

79
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,079
an api to the user we give the program

80
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,080
the

81
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,760
whole program to the user so that they

82
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,200
can do whatever they want with it

83
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,879
and i think for that we need the right

84
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,159
programming language

85
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:04,879
that means the language is fully

86
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:08,319
introspectible that's fully

87
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:12,159
uh that can be fully moulded around

88
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:12,159
and i think a good good um

89
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,000
the right maybe the right language here

90
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,879
is a language from the list family

91
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,319
because

92
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:20,959
those languages are extremely powerful

93
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:23,920
in that sense are very respectable

94
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:24,400
so which shows commonness here and um

95
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,879
well

96
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,879
that's enough with the details now just

97
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:32,399
i'm just going to show you some demos

98
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:35,920
and well you will see for yourself so

99
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:38,480
this is a um

100
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:40,399
no it doesn't matter i will explain here

101
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:43,440
so if i can start a browser

102
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:46,560
okay here there i go

103
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:49,440
um so first of all it's really barren

104
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,640
but uh what i want to show is this area

105
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:54,879
here

106
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,879
which is a little bit similar to

107
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:03,518
and oops

108
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:06,480
damn what um

109
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:06,480
okay sorry about that

110
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:13,439
okay sorry so um

111
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,439
first thing is that we by default we

112
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:17,519
don't show tabs but instead we

113
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:18,560
use an approach that's used by emacs in

114
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:22,400
particular

115
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:23,440
we list all the tabs or that we call

116
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,919
buffers

117
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:27,040
and what's cool about that is that we

118
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:30,240
can search them

119
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,759
so if i write wiki and geeks

120
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,840
i can fuzzy search my tab and go

121
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:37,040
directly to the

122
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:38,400
gnu geeks wikipedia page and we can

123
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,800
extend this concept

124
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,479
or what we call the mini buffer or like

125
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,280
the address bar essentially in the

126
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:45,599
browser

127
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,320
to actually do this for everything for

128
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:50,240
instance

129
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:52,719
uh say i'm browsing here and i see there

130
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,720
is this

131
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,359
table of content here i can actually

132
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:00,639
browse it the same way

133
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:02,639
so if i go roll back enter and i'm

134
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:05,120
directly at the rollback section

135
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:06,479
so we can actually use the this concept

136
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,960
this fuzzy search concept

137
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:10,560
everywhere so it's pretty cool we can

138
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,080
even use it to interact with the browser

139
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,240
itself for instance how many times have

140
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,758
you found yourself with so many tabs you

141
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,680
you were really lost with them and you

142
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,039
wanted to okay let's hear just a bunch

143
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:22,080
of wikipedia pages you don't need

144
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:23,599
it so then i can just start deleting my

145
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:26,000
buffers

146
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,039
i can narrow them down to wiki select

147
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,720
them all

148
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:33,599
enter and they are gone

149
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:35,199
so that's much more productive right and

150
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,960
it's a very simple concept and

151
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:39,520
when you start using it everywhere it

152
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:43,919
starts becoming pretty cool

153
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:45,198
so that's essentially basics for the ui

154
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:47,120
or the ux

155
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:48,560
um but as i mentioned before it's

156
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,039
written in common list which means that

157
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,320
you can

158
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:54,240
leverage the language to hack it

159
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,759
and i mean by that program every single

160
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,080
part of it live

161
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:59,120
so for instance here i go back to my

162
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,440
repo

163
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,039
where i can evaluate code so if i

164
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:06,080
evaluate the function current

165
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:08,800
buffer i get an object here

166
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:10,400
which i can start introspecting and here

167
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:14,240
you get

168
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:15,758
this is a slide slime for command list

169
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,280
this is an introspection window where i

170
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:21,840
get all the details

171
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:21,840
like the title or the url etc

172
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:26,240
and if i go back to my buffer i can

173
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:28,000
start calling functions uh i can say say

174
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:32,720
set url

175
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:35,759
and let's go to my website and

176
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:38,000
there it works

177
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:40,080
um now we can start doing more

178
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,600
sophisticated things like i can define a

179
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:44,240
function

180
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:46,840
so i'm going to copy paste it it's going

181
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:49,280
to be easier

182
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,280
and um

183
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:55,919
wait um sorry where is it

184
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:05,758
oh sorry okay there so i copy paste this

185
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:08,319
okay there so this is essentially a

186
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:10,639
command that will repeat what i just did

187
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:12,319
uh i want to delete all wiki buffers say

188
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:15,360
i keep doing this all over again

189
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:16,080
all the time um well maybe i want to

190
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,680
write a function

191
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:21,919
that will essentially uh

192
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,520
loop over all buffers match all those

193
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:25,520
that match wikipedia

194
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,880
and delete them all so if i evaluate

195
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:30,318
this

196
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:32,560
and i go back to my next window and here

197
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:34,560
this is the list of all comments i have

198
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:37,440
at my disposal

199
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,800
if i start fuzzy searching delete wiki

200
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:41,440
there it is

201
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,639
and well it's double and it's long story

202
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:45,919
oh sorry about it

203
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:46,319
so um and i can call it or i can

204
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:49,919
actually

205
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:53,440
do even better i can bind it to a key

206
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:55,520
um and if i do this

207
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:57,199
i can evaluate code even from within

208
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,719
next you don't need an extra setup that

209
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:00,800
doesn't matter so if

210
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,800
you come and vary it and evaluate this

211
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:05,840
here

212
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:08,800
there so it will evaluate the form now i

213
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:12,159
open a new wikipedia window first them

214
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:14,240
and i've deleted all the wiki

215
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:16,080
uh just pressing the right key binding

216
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,800
i've rerun the command again

217
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:20,400
so i've essentially hacked the browser

218
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,680
while it was running a default function

219
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,599
about it to a key

220
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:27,520
but you can do everything you have full

221
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:30,800
access to to the entire internals

222
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:32,478
it goes a long way

223
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,399
down this road when you can start

224
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:37,680
extending stuff for instance

225
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:40,479
you can easily call to the os

226
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:40,880
components if you want to hook up to get

227
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:43,440
uh

228
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,959
it's very easy to you go on your

229
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:48,000
whatever github page

230
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:50,560
let's say this one and here if i call

231
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
the command vcs clone

232
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,399
i've cloned the repository to my

233
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,480
favorite uh to my local

234
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:57,839
project directory uh that's very

235
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,200
convenient uh we would like to extend

236
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:00,560
this a little more so that it actually

237
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,080
updates the page at the same time to

238
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:07,040
show you that you've cloned it

239
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:08,880
stuff like that um beyond that uh

240
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,160
we've also passwords man what about

241
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,920
password managers i mean they're really

242
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,120
useful i like to have a password manager

243
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:15,599
integrated to my browser

244
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:17,920
it's best for security uh very

245
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:21,600
convenient so we've also

246
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:24,800
simply wrote a bridge to keepassxc

247
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:26,560
and uh password store and depending what

248
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,680
you got installed you can just pre copy

249
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,760
password and

250
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,359
you browse here and first them and then

251
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,560
you get your password and you can paste

252
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:36,640
it

253
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:39,680
um then next i mean i can go on on

254
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:41,279
let's say bookmarks uh so if i want to

255
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:43,359
open my bookmarks i can also

256
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:44,720
fully search them and i can match

257
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,760
against some tags

258
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,720
so if you look at the uh at the end of

259
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:52,080
the lines here

260
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:53,040
the candidates uh if i want to match say

261
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,839
against uh

262
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:57,760
geeks and fast or crypto i can start

263
00:09:55,839 --> 00:10:01,040
writing complex expressions like

264
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:04,319
um sorry um

265
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:06,399
and geeks fast

266
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,519
crypto and as soon as i close the

267
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:09,839
parenthesis

268
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:10,720
i've matched exactly those two types of

269
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:12,560
bookmarks

270
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,760
uh one that has foster gigs the other

271
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,439
one has crypto

272
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:17,120
so imagine you have thousands of

273
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,680
bookmarks you can have extremely

274
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:22,800
powerful

275
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:25,199
match uh tag matching from within the

276
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,199
browser

277
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:32,959
um whatever so what about um

278
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:34,079
let's go back to let's go to tour and if

279
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:36,719
i go here

280
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:38,640
i'll start browsing so i go to the

281
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:42,399
anonymity network

282
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:45,600
and i want to go on the main page

283
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:47,920
okay so i go there i start browsing

284
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,440
and go to documentation then i realize

285
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,120
all right uh i want to go back i want to

286
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,680
go back to the wikipedia page

287
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:55,120
so i go back to the history and go back

288
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:59,040
to tor

289
00:10:55,120 --> 00:11:02,640
um now i'm going down a few more links

290
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:06,560
and at this point i if i go

291
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:08,480
back again and forward again well uh

292
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:10,399
i've written the history i don't have

293
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,160
access to the first

294
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:14,800
branch of the history which was the tour

295
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:16,880
website but here we're a bit smarter

296
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,920
we we try to store everything we start

297
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:20,240
to we

298
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,839
try to store the whole tree of history

299
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:25,360
so we can essentially go

300
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:27,519
sorry history tree and there

301
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,480
i can actually display the whole history

302
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:31,120
of all the

303
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,600
links i've browsed and in a very well

304
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:35,680
tree

305
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:39,360
fashion which is pretty cool right so

306
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:40,640
yeah a few more examples so i think

307
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,880
well i think i've shared a lot of things

308
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:44,880
already oh bookmarks

309
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:46,320
yeah so if you like emacs maybe you like

310
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:48,560
old mode

311
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:50,240
something else you can do is go to your

312
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:53,680
favorite website

313
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:56,560
and if you want to in bookmark this

314
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:57,439
link into your text editor as an org

315
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:00,079
entry

316
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,200
i've written very small functions for it

317
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:04,560
and there i can

318
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:06,399
capture the link and this will be stored

319
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,839
with the right title and the right thing

320
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:09,360
in my org agenda

321
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:11,200
so here i've actually essentially wrote

322
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:13,600
a function to communicate

323
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,240
with the other world by passing code

324
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,399
around

325
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,160
which is quite amazing i'm passing this

326
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:20,399
to an external process

327
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:22,240
and this is just uh one function it's

328
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:23,920
really trivial

329
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,440
that's the the kind of power we can get

330
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,639
when we choose the right language i

331
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:30,320
believe

332
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:32,399
so that would be it for the demo and uh

333
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,600
well i hope you enjoyed it we have a few

334
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:39,839
minutes for the questions

335
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:39,839
so thank you very much

336
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:56,240
yes

337
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:56,959
uh so you mentioned um there was a

338
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,920
password

339
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:00,880
manager integration is for keepers xc

340
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:04,240
and

341
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:06,320
some other it's also password story um

342
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,680
also password manager integration for

343
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:11,200
bit warden

344
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:14,399
for which one uh i can hear you

345
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:16,880
uh is there also uh integration for the

346
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:20,880
password manager big one

347
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:22,880
um oh okay thank you

348
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:24,240
um i mean of course so the question is

349
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:26,560
can we have um

350
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,440
integration with more password managers

351
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,119
and of course

352
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,279
uh really that's that's the whole point

353
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:34,399
is that it's really easy to

354
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:36,079
to uh integrate with all sorts of

355
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:38,399
external processes

356
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:39,760
um and when it comes to the password

357
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:43,199
manager we wrote

358
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:44,639
a this uh virtual interface and you can

359
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:46,399
essentially connect to it and then you

360
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:49,440
get everything uh for

361
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:52,079
for free can

362
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:54,000
can the language be used to uh to um

363
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:55,760
control the page itself like uh

364
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,040
automation similar to what selenium

365
00:13:55,760 --> 00:14:00,560
would do

366
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:02,560
like like selenium so automating within

367
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:05,518
the page find the second link

368
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:07,599
click on that and then fill in the text

369
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:08,880
box and then click the submit button can

370
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:12,240
you do that kind of thing

371
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:15,199
with the language so what

372
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:16,959
really you can leverage the web render

373
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:17,920
to send any sort of javascript that you

374
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:20,959
want

375
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:24,240
and what's also pretty neat is that with

376
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:26,399
a language like lisp you can have maybe

377
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:28,880
you know you've heard of clash of script

378
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:30,240
uh communist has the equivalent called

379
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:33,120
parent script so

380
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:35,040
it amounts to it compiles lisp on the

381
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,680
fly to javascript and sends it to the

382
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,599
browser

383
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:39,839
so you can start compiling everything in

384
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:42,079
lisp but actually interact with a web

385
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:42,079
page

386
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:46,320
hi thank you for the talk uh is there a

387
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:49,199
way

388
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:50,880
for to exchange extensions because there

389
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:52,639
are quite a security risk since

390
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:54,240
they have access to a file system don't

391
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:56,160
they yeah so

392
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,600
have you i'm sure you've thought about

393
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:00,000
it but how do you

394
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:02,399
exchange extensions and make sure that

395
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,120
they're secure

396
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:05,680
you mean so the question is uh so last

397
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,279
question

398
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:09,279
the question is is uh how do you make

399
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:10,399
sure that extensions can be exchanged

400
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:13,519
and or secure

401
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:14,079
so you mean uh third-party extensions so

402
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:16,000
this

403
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:17,760
the answer is very simple for now uh we

404
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,440
don't have third-party extensions

405
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:21,360
uh but in the future of course we want

406
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:23,839
something uh very robust here

407
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:25,600
um i mean i personally work with the

408
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:27,839
geeks package manager which

409
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:29,120
provides a lot of security here so that

410
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:31,759
could be we could leverage

411
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:33,519
this uh package measure to to provide to

412
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:35,279
do distribute extensions

413
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:38,000
that gives you gives us a lot of

414
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:38,000
guarantees here

415
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:41,839
thank you very much
