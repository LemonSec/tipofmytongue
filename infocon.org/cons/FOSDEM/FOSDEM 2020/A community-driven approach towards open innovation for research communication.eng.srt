1
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:10,480
scientific publishing

2
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:10,480
is broken

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,559
the internet was built by scientists for

4
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,880
scientists

5
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:17,680
so that we could share our research to

6
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:20,320
more people

7
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,520
faster and easier the internet has

8
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,920
changed the way that we

9
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:25,279
share a lot of information i'll give you

10
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:28,400
an example

11
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:29,920
so i arrived in let's say brussels i'm

12
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,238
not familiar with the city i want to

13
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:34,480
find restaurants that i want to go to

14
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:36,399
in the past 100 years ago perhaps we

15
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,680
have to rely on a guidebook written by a

16
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:39,280
single person

17
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,800
it had like pages and pages of

18
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,000
restaurants which you have to manually

19
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,599
flip through

20
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,520
you have reviews from maybe one or two

21
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,039
people in the book and

22
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,360
if you have the address you have to sort

23
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:51,920
of navigate another map to go there

24
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,399
nowadays you just go on to google you

25
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,239
with

26
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:56,480
within 30 seconds you can find all the

27
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:58,959
restaurants that are located around you

28
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:01,120
click onto each individual one of them

29
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:03,280
look at the ratings filter by whatever

30
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:05,199
dietary requirements you have

31
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,840
look at the reviews by all the people

32
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:10,320
what they've reviewed before

33
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,439
and with another click gives you real

34
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,679
time direction

35
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:17,439
and timings as to how you can reach that

36
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,439
restaurant with most efficiently

37
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,280
if you look at how research is

38
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,559
communicated between 100 years ago and

39
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,799
nowadays

40
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,400
it's true yes we now have you know links

41
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:28,320
that we can click that you know you can

42
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,479
go to related resources

43
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,240
but it's not like we you know have open

44
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:33,360
review information or reviewers

45
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,439
information

46
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,720
the interactivity of the data or the

47
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:39,839
graph that are shown

48
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:42,000
have not really progressed that much

49
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,520
there's clearly room here for us to

50
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,479
improve the ways

51
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:49,679
that we communicate research using web

52
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:49,679
technology that we have

53
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:54,240
i quoted our editor-in-chief elife's

54
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,279
editor-in-chief mike eisen at the

55
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,520
beginning of this

56
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,719
presentation i'm going to borrow from

57
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:01,200
his presentation again i

58
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:02,880
encourage you strongly to watch the

59
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,000
whole talk on this youtube link that is

60
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,679
on my slide

61
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
um why is this what is this mouse rover

62
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,039
doing

63
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,760
here so on average nowadays

64
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:14,640
it takes nine months for a paper to go

65
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,760
from a step

66
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,399
to a submission to acceptance nine

67
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,679
months

68
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,560
is more or less the amount of time that

69
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:25,760
you send a rover from earth to mars

70
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,879
so imagine the situation where you print

71
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,200
the paper out

72
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:31,280
you put it on this rover you send it to

73
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,518
mars you have this rover

74
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:36,080
churn out the paper on the surface of

75
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:38,000
mars you use those little camera eye

76
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,680
thingies on the on the rover to take

77
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,800
photos of those

78
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:44,160
you beam them back to earth and that

79
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,080
that research

80
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,680
that you can see on camera would be you

81
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,680
know open to everyone because this is

82
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,840
like government funded and all

83
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,200
it would be it would be taking the same

84
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,000
amount of time

85
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,560
and the most shocking thing it takes the

86
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,640
same

87
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,319
it takes even less money than what

88
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:02,238
publishing costs

89
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:03,760
and he did my cousin did some

90
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:05,280
calculations i'm not going to spoil it

91
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:09,760
please go watch that

92
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:13,519
video he's fantastic but so

93
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:16,720
i hope we can all agree that

94
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:18,959
publishing nowadays is slow is expensive

95
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:21,040
it's closed and is emotionally draining

96
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:24,640
who likes reading papers here

97
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:27,120
most of the time okay that's good

98
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,839
when i was a phd student i mean i can

99
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,000
read maybe

100
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,680
one in detail every day maybe two

101
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,080
maximum but it's just really really

102
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,680
draining

103
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,360
and i wish that i didn't have to print

104
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:38,959
all the pdfs out and all this

105
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:40,640
things i i wish we wish that there is a

106
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:41,440
way to make publishing and research

107
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,159
communication

108
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:47,840
faster more cost effective open and

109
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:51,599
ultimately user friendly as well

110
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:53,200
and this is tied into uh the mission

111
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:55,040
of e-life which is the non-profit

112
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,560
organization that i work for

113
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,239
our mission is to help scientists

114
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,000
accelerate discovery by

115
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:01,840
operating a platform for research

116
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,159
communication that encourages

117
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,560
and promote responsible behaviors in

118
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:06,560
science

119
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:12,159
the uh so i'm the innovation community

120
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:15,679
manager at elife

121
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:19,039
and i operate the innovation

122
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:20,110
part of this organization how many of

123
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,680
you have heard of e-life

124
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:24,000
[Music]

125
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,800
great that's that's more than i expected

126
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,400
but

127
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,320
i think most of you would have known us

128
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,638
for being a

129
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,320
journal in the life sciences so we do

130
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:34,880
operate a really good journal

131
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,680
in uh fully open access completely

132
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,440
online in

133
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,600
in the life sciences domain publishing

134
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:42,400
papers from cell biology to

135
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,280
neuroscience but actually what we're

136
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,919
doing there

137
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,638
is we're using this as sort of a

138
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:49,919
playground

139
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:52,080
for experiments in publishing so

140
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:53,440
uh those experiments come from the

141
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,359
innovation initiative

142
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,880
and the initial innovation initiatives

143
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:00,639
mission is to drive

144
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,639
open innovation for open science

145
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,880
so yeah as i said before our overall

146
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,880
mission

147
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,000
is to change publishing from slow to

148
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,159
fast from

149
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,440
expensive to more cost effective from

150
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,280
close to open

151
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:16,880
the method that we employ in innovation

152
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,880
is through the use of technology

153
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,600
so what do we what do we mean by open

154
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,280
innovation

155
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,800
what i mean by that is not only open

156
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,880
source but something that i we're

157
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:29,440
calling open by design this concept

158
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:31,199
has been pretty much uh i've been

159
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:34,800
inspired by the mozilla open leaders

160
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:36,639
training program which is fantastic

161
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,160
it's not just you know about opening the

162
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:41,039
code which is also important

163
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:43,199
but actually as the speaker before me

164
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:45,280
was was talking about it to actually

165
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:49,280
reach out to the community it's very

166
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:49,280
intentional it's very strategic

167
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:56,720
it's very inclusive so this is

168
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:59,120
how you can really

169
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,960
factor in the input from multiple

170
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,120
stakeholders and making sure that all

171
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:05,599
the users are included in the design

172
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,600
process

173
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,600
why is this important how many of you

174
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:12,639
have seen this video

175
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:14,160
of this soap dispenser

176
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:16,720
okay for those of you who haven't seen

177
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:20,800
it it's very it's a very simple

178
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:21,840
yet striking example of why we need to

179
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:25,520
have

180
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:26,560
diverse user testing um this is the soap

181
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,758
dispenser

182
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:32,080
in this video a person with pale skin

183
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:34,639
put his hand under it

184
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:36,479
and they managed to get soap out of it

185
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:37,120
another person with darker skin put

186
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,800
their hands

187
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,960
under the soap dispenser there was no

188
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,759
soap coming out so clearly there was a

189
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:45,039
problem with

190
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:48,000
the the user testing and design process

191
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:49,280
um if you think about this in the tools

192
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,479
that we design for research

193
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:56,000
for example if it's not tested

194
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:59,039
in underrepresented communities then

195
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,800
we have a problem

196
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:02,639
we potentially could be excluding them

197
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,960
from the the process

198
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:06,319
of research discovery evaluation or

199
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:09,680
consumption

200
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:10,560
um and you know i i'm open to arguments

201
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:14,240
on this but

202
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:16,639
these are existing uh biases that we do

203
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,319
not necessarily want to propagate

204
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:20,319
the other problem is again mentioned in

205
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:23,120
the morning and this session

206
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:24,880
so if you have tools built for research

207
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,880
that are not open

208
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,880
let's say you know someone published a

209
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,159
paper that uses a particular package

210
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,440
that is closed

211
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,440
if you would like to reuse that

212
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:35,680
particular pipeline you can no longer do

213
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:38,160
it because you don't have access to it

214
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,520
and so i think this this is why we are

215
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:43,120
at eli we're committed to

216
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:43,120
investing in open innovation

217
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,840
so this is our vision uh to create an

218
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,878
ecosystem of research communication

219
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:51,198
tools that are open

220
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:53,520
inclusive user-centric and to create

221
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:56,639
this with the community

222
00:07:53,520 --> 00:08:01,840
so how do we make sure that these tools

223
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:01,840
can be it can fulfill these criteria

224
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:06,400
for that we have to put together the

225
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:08,240
users of the tools so the researchers

226
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:11,120
and the people who know the technology

227
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:13,520
so software developers web designers

228
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:16,080
et cetera et cetera in the same space to

229
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:18,560
give them time to talk to each other to

230
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,440
emphasize with each other's situations

231
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,479
and then to

232
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:24,639
create those prototypes and solutions so

233
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:26,479
this is exactly the reason why we

234
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:28,400
designed this event

235
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:30,240
it's called the e-live innovation sprint

236
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:34,319
it's been running for two years now

237
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:36,479
this so 2020 will be the third year um

238
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,320
it takes place it took place in

239
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:41,039
cambridge for the last two runs

240
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,560
we put together 60 researchers

241
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:44,480
technologists

242
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:46,079
product managers designers policy

243
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,320
advisors etc

244
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,839
two days and they work on a great

245
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,800
variety of projects these are some of

246
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:53,120
the prototypes that

247
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,880
came out of the innovation sprints for

248
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,440
the last two years

249
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,560
you can check them all out i think the

250
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,240
2018

251
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:02,000
projects were a bit more mature so for

252
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,760
example plotted is like a lightweight

253
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,240
endorsement so i like button for

254
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:08,399
research you can debate whether or not

255
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,160
that's a good idea but the idea for us

256
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:11,760
is to put it out there so that you can

257
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,680
see it and use it and tell

258
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,040
tell us what you think and this is a

259
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:18,479
theme that you will see

260
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,480
recurring in the work that we do

261
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:24,479
so we uh one of the

262
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:26,640
so these are all fantastic projects one

263
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,519
of the projects that i really want to

264
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:30,000
highlight that sort of

265
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:32,399
came out of the sprint as well um in

266
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,839
2018 is the following

267
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:35,519
so this is called the reproducible

268
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,519
document stack i'm hoping that this

269
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:39,920
video will work

270
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:40,560
it's basically putting back code and

271
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,680
data

272
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:49,040
into the narration of a manuscript

273
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:49,040
boop so let's see

274
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,279
so this looks like a normal e-life paper

275
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:57,040
when you browse through it

276
00:09:53,279 --> 00:10:00,560
um so this is all live the demo is there

277
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:02,240
and with some of the figures you can

278
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:04,560
click on this button on the top

279
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:06,480
left and that will expose the script

280
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:09,040
that is underlying that figure

281
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,760
so here this is written in r if you

282
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,719
remember

283
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:13,360
the previous plot was a bar plot so i

284
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,640
personally

285
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:19,600
really don't like bar plots

286
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:20,079
so i decided to change it so this is now

287
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,200
i was

288
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:24,959
when i was changing it and we

289
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:28,000
immediately you can see that that was

290
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:32,000
live execute re-executed in the browser

291
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,760
and that changed it to a dot plot

292
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,360
so you can try this out for yourself uh

293
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,640
honest like it might be slightly broken

294
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,279
now because we're trying to

295
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:41,199
make progress on it but uh it's working

296
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:45,040
you have to trust me for that

297
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:47,040
um but yes so

298
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,399
we've been developing this project in

299
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,800
collaboration with

300
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:53,839
uh two open source uh organizations

301
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:56,519
stenciling substance since 2017.

302
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:58,000
um in the e-life innovation sprint in

303
00:10:56,519 --> 00:11:00,560
2018

304
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,560
a group of people made very uh

305
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:04,880
significant progress on

306
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:07,599
enabling us to launch that prototype

307
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,600
that you just saw

308
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,360
what i'm trying to illustrate with that

309
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,240
is something that we learned through

310
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,839
this process

311
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,240
again going back to what i talked about

312
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:19,200
before about open by design

313
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,880
we try very hard to actively communicate

314
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,079
what we're doing and all the decisions

315
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,519
that we're making

316
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:25,279
so to make sure that you know the

317
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,399
community is informed and that they can

318
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:30,640
provide feedback

319
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:32,800
at various points of that development

320
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:34,560
um the other thing is what i what i

321
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:37,439
talked about before that we

322
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:38,719
we like to show we like to prototype so

323
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:42,079
the design process

324
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:44,480
for us and also something that i i

325
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:46,560
really agree with is not one where you

326
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,480
plan out everything from the beginning

327
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:50,160
but you do an iteration cycle of

328
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,600
launching something getting feedback

329
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,399
fixing it again and then getting

330
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,440
feedback and

331
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:58,000
repeat that and so when we put out this

332
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:00,240
demo in february 2019

333
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,079
um we got very positive feedback for it

334
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,920
and and you know it encouraged us to

335
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:07,199
develop a roadmap towards

336
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:08,959
making it scalable and uh publishers

337
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:11,600
friendly basically

338
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:12,479
and hopefully in a couple of months we

339
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,760
will be

340
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:18,639
rolling out um a way for authors to

341
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:20,480
basically submit these articles to us

342
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:22,240
and to make their own articles that has

343
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:25,839
been already published

344
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,839
reproducible in that manner

345
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:29,359
the other thing that we learned is uh

346
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:32,399
something that again was

347
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:34,639
i i really think i think robin who spoke

348
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:37,040
before me for emphasizing this

349
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:37,760
was that there are many stakeholders

350
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:41,839
within

351
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:41,839
the product that we're working on um

352
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,920
you know we need to really listen to

353
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:48,639
them and to make sure that

354
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:50,079
uh we take their opinion into account

355
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:52,560
but at the same time you know it's a

356
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:55,519
balancing act between uh

357
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:56,800
launching something and also the the

358
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:58,079
sort of trade-offs between

359
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,000
satisfying different types of

360
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:01,839
stakeholders so

361
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,200
publishers for example want to make sure

362
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:05,360
that the the

363
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,959
the product will be compatible with the

364
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:10,800
publishing workflow which

365
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:12,719
is very complicated researchers

366
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,959
we want researchers to be able to use it

367
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:18,480
whatever tool they were using before

368
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:21,359
so in the in the

369
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:23,200
the workflow that we're gonna go gonna

370
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:26,079
launch in april

371
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:27,760
uh researchers will be able to start

372
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:30,000
from a jupiter notebook or an

373
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,959
r markdown or a google doc if that's

374
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,959
what they were using

375
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:34,719
we cannot just ignore users who don't

376
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:36,239
know how to code we really want to make

377
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,399
sure that at some point

378
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:41,040
they would also be able to make their

379
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:43,040
articles computationally reproducible

380
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,719
um sorry that's a lot of empty talk for

381
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:46,319
something that doesn't really exist yet

382
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,920
but we're working towards it if you want

383
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:51,120
update there's the link to sign

384
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:54,000
up for them um

385
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:55,360
the other thing that we learned through

386
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,440
developing this product

387
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,920
and also through running and operating

388
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:02,639
and organizing the sprint

389
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:05,120
is that actually probably the most

390
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:07,360
powerful outcome of our work

391
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,639
and goal is to empower people and

392
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:12,000
communities

393
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:14,399
so to give people the confidence

394
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,320
and the skills to be able to develop

395
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:21,120
products to use

396
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:23,680
open by design and so

397
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,399
this is sort of a summary of the sort of

398
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:27,279
new

399
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:27,680
uh work that we're doing this year uh

400
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:30,959
this

401
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:32,959
includes so uh yeah

402
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:34,719
we now have we earlier this year we

403
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,839
launched a new mentorship and training

404
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:39,199
program

405
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:40,560
to train people to develop uh research

406
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:43,599
communication tools

407
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:44,479
openly in this training program we teach

408
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,600
them

409
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:51,279
uh skills from design thinking to

410
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:53,360
marketing to sustainability

411
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:55,120
if you have an idea please come and talk

412
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:57,920
to us

413
00:14:55,120 --> 00:15:00,079
we offer support from funding to

414
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:03,279
mentorship to promotion

415
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:06,079
and so we are happy to

416
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:06,480
work with you to make sure that you also

417
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:08,638
as a

418
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,560
as an innovator get something out of

419
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:13,839
this process rather than just having

420
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,839
a good tool out there

421
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:19,760
so that was a short talk but

422
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:21,839
here are all the things that you can do

423
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:25,600
to stay updated to

424
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:27,600
the things that you can participate in

425
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:30,000
so we are we have a community called

426
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:31,839
actually coming up next month so you are

427
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,079
if you are interested if you've never

428
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:36,560
worked on research communication tools

429
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:38,959
and you don't know what is out there

430
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:40,319
this dev room was a great starting point

431
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:42,239
but you can hear about

432
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:44,160
some of the projects in this community

433
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:46,639
by joining our call

434
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,759
we do have e-life labs where we

435
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:51,680
regularly

436
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:54,480
feature open projects and people

437
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:56,160
that works and work in this field if you

438
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:59,920
would like to participate into

439
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:02,800
in the fantastic sprint that i described

440
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:04,639
there's a link to sign up for updates

441
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:09,839
yeah thank you very much for listening

442
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:09,839
and i'm ready to take questions

443
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:20,320
i have a question about first of all

444
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:22,399
nice talk

445
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,160
about the reproducible document stack

446
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:26,880
what back end did you use

447
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:28,240
for that so how was it generated because

448
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:31,680
it kind of resembled

449
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:32,480
uh to me as a jupiter but i might be

450
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:36,319
wrong

451
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:39,120
yeah so uh the back end is

452
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:41,040
the demo was a binder back end if you

453
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:44,639
know binder is a jupiter-based

454
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:47,680
uh container uh

455
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:49,920
this is as far as i can yeah so

456
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:51,439
so so it's a it's basically containers

457
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:54,319
so you can access

458
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:55,120
uh when you re when you re-execute that

459
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:58,560
code

460
00:16:55,120 --> 00:17:00,000
um you connect to that that container

461
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:02,959
that was generated

462
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,759
from that image that you you you changed

463
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:06,000
um

464
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:07,599
we are because of yeah because we want

465
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,919
it to be reliable and performant

466
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:11,599
we are working with stencilla who is

467
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:13,600
work who is doing a lot of work to

468
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:14,480
basically make that bit more performant

469
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:16,159
and making sure

470
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,679
because if you launch that demo you will

471
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,400
realize that it takes about five minutes

472
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:20,880
to

473
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,839
to settle down and that's not the ideal

474
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,000
situation that we

475
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:26,000
we want to end up at but yeah but it's

476
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,679
not as intuitive as

477
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,919
we thought like when we first started

478
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:31,840
this project um

479
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:33,440
but yeah we're happy that we've got

480
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:35,439
great partners working with us to make

481
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:39,200
make sure that it's

482
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:39,200
it's going to be performant yeah

483
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:42,960
um i think you mentioned that when

484
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:45,039
you're

485
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,240
once you have start publishing

486
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:48,559
reproducible

487
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:50,720
papers you're going to go back to

488
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:51,760
existing publications and sort of redo

489
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:55,039
them

490
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:56,320
um do you expect do you have a strategy

491
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:57,520
of how you're going to get people to do

492
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:00,399
that because i imagine there's going to

493
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:02,320
be some resistance

494
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:04,240
uh i will repeat the question because i

495
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:08,080
forgot that so the question was

496
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:10,799
how are we going to um get authors to

497
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,678
actually redo their paper republish

498
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:14,799
their papers

499
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:17,840
in a reproducible manner um

500
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:19,840
great question i think it's difficult uh

501
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,320
we rely on e-life authors agreeing with

502
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,959
our

503
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:24,960
ethos basically um there is not much

504
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:27,440
incentive at the moment to make your

505
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:29,120
paper reproducible that it doesn't give

506
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,080
you an extra doi it doesn't give you any

507
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:33,199
credit

508
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:35,439
um but it's you know it's cool

509
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,440
and

510
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:40,000
and we actually have authors emailing us

511
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,840
asking if we could

512
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,360
have their papers up as reproducible

513
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:46,799
articles

514
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:50,240
where the the idea here

515
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:51,600
is i always say to make it very easy to

516
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,600
do the right thing

517
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:56,159
so the user experience that we provide

518
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:59,439
is a one-click experience hopefully

519
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:02,160
so this is all work in progress

520
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:03,840
but the idea is that you will go on

521
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:05,600
stencil hub you will paste the link of

522
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:07,199
your original e-life article so you need

523
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:09,120
to be accepted first

524
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,880
you'll place that link to the article

525
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:13,120
you can add you can basically in

526
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:15,440
a google doc type interface drag your

527
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:17,760
code chunk into the article

528
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:19,120
save that send the link back to the

529
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,480
production team at elife

530
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:22,879
and we'll do the rest of the work for

531
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:25,679
you and you'll get that fancy article

532
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,880
and and so so so it should be really

533
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:28,880
easy

534
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,200
and you know you get something that you

535
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:32,480
can tweet about

536
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:34,960
[Laughter]

537
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,960
uh yeah

538
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:44,080
typical day to say how big is it for

539
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:46,879
these reproducible articles

540
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:47,520
because i guess at some point even if we

541
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,120
bind

542
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,879
in jupiter notebooks there is a

543
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:53,520
scalability problem

544
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:54,880
yes so repeating that question how big

545
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,760
are the data sets that we're working

546
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:58,640
with

547
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:59,919
at the moment we are targeting mostly

548
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:02,960
tabular data so

549
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:04,960
small csv files that are directly used

550
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,559
to generate those graphs

551
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,640
it also has to do with the amount of

552
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:10,320
compute that will be used as

553
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,919
let's say you have a very popular paper

554
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,879
that's accessed by a hundred thousand

555
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:15,760
people

556
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:17,120
um we can't afford to have everyone

557
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,400
rerunning all the analysis

558
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:20,239
if it's like i don't know genome

559
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:23,200
alignment

560
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,760
so so at the moment the first prototype

561
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,720
again

562
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:27,440
is something small csv that can be

563
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:30,080
attached

564
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,120
to the reproducible article format that

565
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:33,600
we have

566
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:34,399
but we are looking for you know we are

567
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,559
working we are

568
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:38,240
we like my vision for this for the next

569
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:39,760
step is to work with the community to

570
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:42,799
figure out a roadmap of

571
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:44,240
what features we need to implement next

572
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:45,918
so that will that will also mean

573
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,760
collaborating with other people

574
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:49,440
other especially open data folks who

575
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,000
have been working on this for a long

576
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:52,400
time

577
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,559
to figure out how we can work together

578
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:58,080
yeah

579
00:20:54,559 --> 00:21:01,280
uh they're in limit yeah i had a comment

580
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:04,320
actually thanks for your talk

581
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:06,799
you were somewhat critical of how long

582
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:08,879
it takes sometimes for a publication to

583
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:11,918
go from submission to

584
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:14,080
actual publication uh i myself

585
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:16,400
am actually a regular reviewer for the

586
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:18,158
royal society of chemistry and

587
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,240
american chemical society such

588
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:22,880
institutions

589
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:24,559
we often get a lot of junk on our desks

590
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:27,200
to begin with

591
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:28,480
and one of the things we take these

592
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:31,440
months for

593
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:32,480
is actually to force the researchers to

594
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,799
give us

595
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:36,000
the original data that they used to make

596
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:39,039
their publications we

597
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,400
absolutely 100 sure that they're telling

598
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:44,400
us the truth

599
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:45,520
so it's i mean i'm i'm not so surprised

600
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:48,159
by the length of that

601
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:48,879
and i've seen cases where i'd be happy

602
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:50,880
to drag

603
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:52,080
the reviewers through a much lengthier

604
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,760
process

605
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:56,158
because they just were trying to hide

606
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,158
something

607
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:00,799
yeah the authors yeah thanks thanks a

608
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:03,200
lot you have to really

609
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:04,480
tear it out of them like we need the

610
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,320
hard data in your

611
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:08,400
supplementary materials because we need

612
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:11,120
to know if this is true and

613
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:12,080
sometimes they even retract so thanks a

614
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:15,439
lot for that comment

615
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:15,918
if i repeat it um the comment is about

616
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:18,559
how

617
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:19,440
there's a reason for the lengthy uh

618
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:21,600
reviewing

619
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,960
process before publication because we do

620
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:25,918
actually the reviewing process

621
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:27,360
adds value to the publication i agree

622
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:29,520
100

623
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,479
i don't want elif to go out of business

624
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:33,520
that's not the reason

625
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:36,320
um i do think that publishers and

626
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:37,200
reviewers do make to add value to the

627
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:39,439
publication

628
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:41,039
my question for perhaps to you and

629
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:43,919
others is that why can't

630
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:45,679
this process be open so i'm sure you may

631
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:47,760
be aware of preprints

632
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:48,720
you can put i mean nowadays anyone can

633
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,320
publish anything

634
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,840
you can tweet a photo of your cat and

635
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:53,918
that's publishing right

636
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:56,000
the reason why you know people don't

637
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:57,840
maybe recognize that is because

638
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,159
it's not been reviewed it's not been

639
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:02,399
vetted

640
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:03,280
and there is no reason why the

641
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,520
publication

642
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:07,600
shouldn't be dissociated from the

643
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:10,559
process of reviewing

644
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:12,080
and why reviewing cannot be done in

645
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:14,559
public so imagine

646
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:17,120
in this case you will have the paper

647
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:19,280
that you know maybe has incomplete data

648
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:21,120
someone else in the open will say hey

649
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:23,039
i'd like to access your data

650
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:24,239
could you please upload it and this

651
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:27,679
hosts this course

652
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:28,799
to benefit from being exposed to a wider

653
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:31,520
audience

654
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:33,280
i believe i'm happy to hear otherwise

655
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:36,400
but yes

656
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:38,480
uh i believe okay just a comment

657
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:40,159
uh i work in a different domain and

658
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:43,919
atmospheric science and

659
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:47,200
the european geosciences union publishes

660
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:50,720
20 plus journals and

661
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:53,760
for over 20 years now in a public

662
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:54,640
peer-review model these are high impact

663
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:57,679
factor

664
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:59,039
journals very visible in the community

665
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:01,440
and the whole pre-review is

666
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:02,799
public you can browse through initial

667
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:05,679
version

668
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:07,360
reviewers comments the reply all the

669
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:10,559
workflow is public for every paper

670
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:11,760
yeah this is

671
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:14,559
first part of the comment the second

672
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:17,039
part is that whenever i read through

673
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:18,720
the reviews that are public there i have

674
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:20,320
this feeling that

675
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,919
why the reviewer didn't take a bit

676
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:24,320
longer and go

677
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:25,440
through more detail to add even more

678
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:27,918
value so

679
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,960
i'm not sure if especially encouraging

680
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:32,080
people to

681
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:35,279
bring the reproducibility in yeah which

682
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:36,799
adds more tasks for the reviewer because

683
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:38,640
now you can play with

684
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:39,918
the simulation or something yeah it

685
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:42,720
takes even more time you

686
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:43,840
can play with it yeah compared to just

687
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,559
the text

688
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:47,439
so i'm also skeptical about shortening

689
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:50,480
this

690
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:52,159
this time i i completely sorry

691
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:53,760
so the comment was about the fact that

692
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:56,320
actually yeah the

693
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:58,000
the longer because of the the the

694
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,480
richness of the research nowadays we can

695
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,960
actually

696
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,919
afford a lengthier review process i

697
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,559
agree completely

698
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:06,159
i just think that it's just like why is

699
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:06,799
a research paper final because it

700
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:08,640
shouldn't be

701
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:10,559
because knowledge is always evolving

702
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:12,559
because you will always have

703
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:13,600
an evolving research community who will

704
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:16,320
join and leave and

705
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:18,158
knowledge gets updated so you know a

706
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:19,678
paper should not be the end point of a

707
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:20,640
certain research question it should be a

708
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:22,880
starting point

709
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,840
for a lively discussion and that should

710
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:26,080
all you know be

711
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:28,158
publicly participatory and elife is

712
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:31,120
doing a lot of work to make sure that

713
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:33,520
that is the future that we pay for

714
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:36,479
publishing

715
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:37,760
sorry i'm happy to talk afterwards but

716
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:43,840
thank you very much for your comments

717
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:43,840
thank you

718
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,799
you
