1
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:10,400
thank you for having me here

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,840
my name is max meal i work for the free

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:14,799
software foundation europe

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:17,119
the fsfe we are a charity that empowers

5
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:19,279
users to control technology

6
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:20,240
and today i would like to talk with you

7
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:23,519
about

8
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:25,919
one of our projects called reuse this is

9
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:29,119
a nice project aimed towards developers

10
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:32,320
but also people reusing software code

11
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:33,920
and how we can make that easier but

12
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,040
before getting started right into the

13
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:39,040
topic

14
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:42,000
i would like to ask you for some honesty

15
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:44,960
so i have three simple questions so if

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,600
it applies to you please raise your hand

17
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:50,160
the first question is who of you has

18
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:52,960
ever programmed some software code

19
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,480
maybe a shell script or a sophisticated

20
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:58,800
program

21
00:00:54,480 --> 00:01:00,959
okay i see 95 percent of the hands up

22
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,640
perhaps the last five percent are either

23
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,520
sleeping or never really never touched

24
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,119
software code

25
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,880
but this is fine as well don't leave the

26
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:08,720
room it might be interesting to you as

27
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:12,158
well what i'm talking about

28
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:14,720
second question is who has ever released

29
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:17,200
some software code so released it as

30
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:19,840
free software

31
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:22,080
okay numbers drop knocks not

32
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:24,080
significantly eighty percent

33
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,439
that's awesome folks you're awesome

34
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:29,119
you're providing

35
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:31,520
code your your creativity

36
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:33,119
as free software to other people you

37
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,039
spread the four freedoms

38
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:36,320
and enable people to control technology

39
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,400
that's awesome

40
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,758
but now the last questions before we get

41
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,799
started

42
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:43,759
who has never been confused by how to

43
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:47,040
properly

44
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:50,079
license their free software code

45
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:52,240
never one two three wow guys

46
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:53,600
either you're really blatantly lied to

47
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:56,719
me

48
00:01:53,600 --> 00:02:00,158
are your geniuses really

49
00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:02,000
congrats okay next genius um so

50
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:03,680
this is a problem right we have four

51
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,600
people in this room

52
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,600
roughly five percent who probably know

53
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:10,878
how to do free software licensing

54
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:13,040
we should change that so

55
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:15,519
there are some common uncertainties when

56
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:19,040
doing free software licensing right

57
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:21,440
so the most easiest question is where

58
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,640
do i put the information about my chosen

59
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:25,760
license

60
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:28,640
so you do free software you release that

61
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,599
and you think about which license should

62
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,599
it have

63
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:32,799
like which under which conditions can

64
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:35,599
users use

65
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:38,319
and reuse your software because that's

66
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:41,518
your freedom to decide that

67
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:43,518
but where to put that in the readme file

68
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:45,760
in some license text somewhere in the

69
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:48,480
repo

70
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:50,079
do you have to edit every file or do you

71
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:53,359
have to call richard stallman

72
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,760
to ask him well that that's a problem

73
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,280
right

74
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:59,040
we don't know or many people don't know

75
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,120
and what do i do when i have multiple

76
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:03,519
licenses in my project

77
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,519
so this could well be if you your code

78
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:07,519
is under a gpl license

79
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:09,120
well under which license you can decide

80
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:09,840
but you have some documentation for

81
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,239
instance

82
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,920
which is should be under like a

83
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:15,680
documentation license and the text

84
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,518
license like creative commons

85
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,879
so you have now two licenses where to

86
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,519
put this information

87
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:23,760
two license files in your repo that's

88
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:26,400
that's complicated

89
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,959
then very important how can we make sure

90
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,319
that we

91
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:32,799
users are aware of the license

92
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:34,640
that we've chosen so you said i want to

93
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:36,239
have a copy left license or i don't want

94
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,798
to have a copy left license

95
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:40,400
how can you inform we users so other

96
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:42,319
free software projects

97
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,599
individual users but also big

98
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:46,238
corporations

99
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:47,920
about your choice how can you do that

100
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:49,360
like how to make them really aware of

101
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:53,040
what you think about

102
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,040
your conditions for reuse

103
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,200
and well last but not least free

104
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,360
software is great because

105
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,480
because we can build on top of what

106
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,200
others have

107
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:04,079
solved so we have an issue a problem

108
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,319
another guy

109
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,000
another girl on the internet solved that

110
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:10,399
issue you want to take

111
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,519
the code and reuse it in your own

112
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,200
program

113
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:15,120
to make a shortcut that's great free

114
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:18,079
software enables you to do that

115
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:21,358
but how to find out which conditions

116
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:23,600
which license the other person chose

117
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:25,919
so now you have to crawl through the

118
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,840
repository the readme file or you have

119
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:30,400
to trust something like github.com and

120
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:32,400
the license indicator on top and

121
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,159
that's that's that's not really cool i

122
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,320
mean that that's work and free software

123
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:39,360
programming should be fun

124
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:41,120
so we thought we really have to make

125
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,080
licensing and copyright easier for

126
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,919
everyone

127
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,520
so we have to find easy solutions

128
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:48,080
because the solutions out there

129
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:49,280
are not really solving the problem and

130
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:52,320
we came up with some

131
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:53,679
something called reuse wii use is

132
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,440
supposed to help you

133
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:58,400
free software developers and free

134
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:00,719
software reuses

135
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,560
our idea is to solve this problem at the

136
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:05,039
very source

137
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:07,039
so we don't store information about our

138
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:07,919
copyright and our licensing choice

139
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:10,159
somewhere else

140
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:11,758
but as close as possible to the source

141
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,720
files

142
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:15,360
so the idea is that it's really hard to

143
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,440
ignore

144
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,280
your licensing choice and your copyright

145
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,680
information

146
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:23,198
so what we did is to came up come up

147
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,360
with best practices

148
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:26,800
for free software developers to make

149
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,120
this licensing easy and

150
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,080
transparent for everyone so easy for

151
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,919
developers

152
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:34,560
easy for re-users and as i said the idea

153
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:36,479
is to

154
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,680
store this information as close as

155
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:42,320
possible to the source

156
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:45,840
so ideally at every file so

157
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:48,159
sorry um so in you would have in each

158
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,840
source code file a license header or

159
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,759
something like that or something where

160
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,599
it's really easy to find this licensing

161
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:58,000
and copyright information

162
00:05:53,600 --> 00:06:01,280
and so the steps to reach this goal

163
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:04,960
are quite simple there are three steps

164
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:06,559
the first is choose and provide licenses

165
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,159
so you should as a free software

166
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:11,280
developer make a conscious

167
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:13,840
decision about which license to choose

168
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,960
and store this in a dedicated place like

169
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:18,080
the full license

170
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:20,799
text inside of your repo

171
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:24,000
the second part is to add copyright and

172
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:28,160
licensing information to every file

173
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,919
so either add a commentator to every

174
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,199
source code file or if that's not

175
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:34,240
possible like for

176
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:36,319
binary files like pictures or like

177
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,680
other edge cases we also provide some

178
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:40,720
other alternatives to do that

179
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:43,120
the ideas again as close as possible as

180
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,400
transparent as possible and the last

181
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:47,440
step is to

182
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,159
confirm wheels compliance that's quite

183
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:51,120
simple

184
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,479
we have a reuse helper tool which can

185
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,400
check your repository

186
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:56,400
and you can verify whether you have this

187
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:58,479
information available for every file

188
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,599
if that's done you get a big fat smiley

189
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:02,719
and you're

190
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:04,880
done for this so this is one example

191
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,560
um how this may could look like this is

192
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:09,759
a comment header which could

193
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:13,280
could you could store in in the file and

194
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:15,280
it just has two lines basically the spdx

195
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,318
license identifier so that's a unique

196
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:19,039
identifier

197
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:20,000
for the license you've chosen so that's

198
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,919
really clear

199
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,759
and the second is a copyright who is the

200
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:25,280
copyright holder of the file

201
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:26,880
and this is also very important

202
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,479
information that's

203
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,880
the most important information you need

204
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:33,360
to give out and if you release free

205
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,360
software

206
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:37,919
so this sounds quite theoretical uh we

207
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:39,599
made it practical

208
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:42,080
we have the set helper tool which

209
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:45,759
enables your helps you

210
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:47,680
in becoming wheels compliant so

211
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:48,800
this doesn't only check whether your is

212
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,560
compliant but also

213
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:53,120
give a tool to initialize your

214
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:55,039
repository uh to download the license

215
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:57,120
text so you don't have to

216
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:58,479
find them in in the internet from

217
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:02,639
different sources

218
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:04,800
and it also helps you in adding

219
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:06,400
these licensing and copyright

220
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:09,120
information to the

221
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:10,318
header to the header or author of the

222
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,199
files or also the

223
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:14,639
alternative solutions so this by that

224
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:16,800
becomes really simple

225
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:18,240
and the tool is easy to install you can

226
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,000
find it online it's free software of

227
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,960
course

228
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,720
but we also work on the like learning

229
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:27,039
side so we have a tutorial that

230
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,800
will get you started so you will go

231
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:31,120
through an example repository

232
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,479
and you will just learn how to make this

233
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:35,120
wheels compliant

234
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:35,680
and in order to help you to understand

235
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:40,000
the

236
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:41,760
principles of reuse we also have an faq

237
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,440
this is not only for the reuse tool and

238
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:45,200
the real

239
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,720
best practices but also for basic

240
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:49,680
licensing questions

241
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:51,040
like for instance what is copyright how

242
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:53,040
does licensing work

243
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,560
do i have to put something like the year

244
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,880
in my copyright statement or something

245
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,000
like

246
00:08:54,880 --> 00:09:00,800
so really simple things and to be honest

247
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,560
one year ago or two years ago before i

248
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,000
really started to get into this reuse

249
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,839
project

250
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,279
i also didn't have much clue about it

251
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:08,640
but like this faq

252
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:11,279
and the whole combination of the

253
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,959
tutorial and the simple guidelines

254
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:14,320
really also helped me to understand

255
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:16,800
copyright and licensing

256
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,839
and to make this easier so if i have a

257
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,880
free software project

258
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:22,000
now it's really simple we have the best

259
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:24,399
practices of course

260
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,680
so this is not only nice words on some

261
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:28,399
website but we have a

262
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,680
formal specification of reuse so the

263
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:31,440
idea is that

264
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:33,199
this is not a small movement but that we

265
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,880
can make this a standard for every free

266
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,360
software project out there

267
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:39,519
so there's a formal specification for

268
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:42,720
source forges for

269
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:44,640
companies also for projects that you can

270
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:47,600
follow and that we constantly develop

271
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:48,240
if you see need for that and last but

272
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,160
not least

273
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:53,760
we have something like a reuse as a

274
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:56,240
service so we call this the reuse api

275
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:58,399
by this you can quickly register your

276
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:00,560
project your free software project

277
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:01,680
so it's any git repository no matter

278
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,359
whether it's on

279
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,760
a github gitlab or some other

280
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,760
independent git platform

281
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:10,480
you can register your project you can

282
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:13,600
see whether it's already reuse compliant

283
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:15,839
well it probably won't but it will

284
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,680
create a dynamic badge that you can

285
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:18,320
include in your readme file so people

286
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:21,040
can see

287
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,880
that your wheels combined and see the

288
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,160
result of the reuse check already so

289
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,760
this is dynamic

290
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,360
if you came to the point that the three

291
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,040
is compliant

292
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,720
you will always see that if you're not

293
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,319
reas compliant it will also show

294
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,399
that this is not the case so this is

295
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:36,800
really transparent and really easy to

296
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:36,800
start with

297
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:42,320
so speaking about easy to start with

298
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:44,160
who's already using reuse

299
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,320
so obviously we started with our own

300
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,199
projects and worked quite well so the

301
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,680
efficacy

302
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:51,200
repos but a really cool thing is that

303
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,079
there's the next generation internet

304
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,200
project

305
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:56,079
this is a big project by the european

306
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,680
commission

307
00:10:56,079 --> 00:11:03,040
where the fund 120 or over 120

308
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:05,599
projects software projects that make

309
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,480
the internet or should make the internet

310
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,839
safer

311
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:13,839
more secure and privacy friendly

312
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:15,519
so we have 120 free software projects

313
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:17,200
that are reuse compliant funded with

314
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:18,320
public money so this is a really great

315
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,720
thing and this will

316
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:22,399
speed up the whole thing but we also

317
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,760
have and this is really great to know

318
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:26,560
the linux kernel

319
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:28,480
this is right now 60 to 70 percent

320
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:30,160
reason compliant already so they have

321
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,240
added the copyright information

322
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,279
and added the license identifiers

323
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:36,399
already to

324
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:38,959
670 percent of their files

325
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:39,920
and this is great uh when you know that

326
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:42,640
the linux kernel

327
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:43,519
has such a long history and so many

328
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,439
confusing

329
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:46,560
like copyright statements with changing

330
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,240
companies and stuff

331
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,839
it's really complicated to clean that up

332
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,560
but the linux kernel is already quite

333
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:52,880
far

334
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:54,079
and so we hope to help with these guys

335
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:57,600
to finish

336
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:59,680
this up very soon we also know about

337
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,399
some multinational corporations who are

338
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,319
already

339
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:04,240
using reuse and make this a best

340
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,560
practice for their developers for their

341
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,519
free software projects and so one

342
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:10,079
question remains

343
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:11,760
is your project already wheels compliant

344
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:13,920
probably not but you should do that

345
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:15,120
so go to real software and make your

346
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,279
free software

347
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,720
project wheels compliant and by that

348
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:21,200
secure

349
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,839
your intentions how you want to have

350
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,839
your

351
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:25,519
code handled by other parties by your

352
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:27,839
users

353
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:29,120
so if you want to contribute of course

354
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:32,000
everything is free software

355
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:33,920
and quite transparent so we look forward

356
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,880
to your bug reports if you try it out we

357
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:38,639
look forward to pull requests

358
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:41,040
also to the website also to the

359
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:43,120
specification everything is transparent

360
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:45,199
uh so please help us in becoming better

361
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:47,200
and make it easier for everyone

362
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:49,200
you can work on this and on many other

363
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:51,040
projects if you become an fsme

364
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,560
intern so we just opened up a few

365
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,160
positions so

366
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:56,399
no matter which background whether

367
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:59,199
social science technical

368
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:01,440
legal we have many cool projects and

369
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:05,040
among them is also the reuse project so

370
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:08,320
check out fsfebrus.org and of course

371
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:10,319
spread the word try it out

372
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,760
if you like it tell your friends tell

373
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,560
your colleagues tell your free software

374
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:15,040
projects

375
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:17,040
tell your boss in the in your company

376
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:19,360
that would be great we need that because

377
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:20,800
we use is only mighty becomes only

378
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,959
mighty and useful for

379
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,079
many people if as many projects as

380
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:26,800
possible we become

381
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:28,560
we as compliant and thereby make

382
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:32,240
copyright and licensing easy

383
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:33,199
fun and simple again so

384
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,959
i would like to thank you for your

385
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:37,200
attention if you have any questions go

386
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:38,000
to reals.software or just approach me

387
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:48,880
after the talk

388
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:51,600
or ask some question now thank you

389
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,600
any questions

390
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:01,920
does distributing the license across all

391
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,920
the files not make it a bit more

392
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:05,599
difficult as well to find

393
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:07,439
where should i be looking for the file

394
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,880
the license that will apply to my reuse

395
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,560
of this code so if you have

396
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,600
20 different files potentially with

397
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,680
different licenses you have to go and

398
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,519
check all of them

399
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,638
yeah sure but the idea is that you i

400
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:18,720
mean it doesn't matter whether you have

401
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:19,440
only one license or 20 licenses over 20

402
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,000
files

403
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,519
you can also do a license files but it's

404
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,360
important that if you do that like for

405
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:28,320
instance you use from a third party

406
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:30,480
a certain library then this might have a

407
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,959
different license so it's important that

408
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,600
people reusing them from your code which

409
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:36,800
are other

410
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:39,920
in which you also reused other uh com uh

411
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:41,760
components that it's quite simple to see

412
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,439
ideally at the top of the file under

413
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,000
which license from which copyright

414
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,839
holder this

415
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,199
file is so of course it might be

416
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:48,240
complicated but that's free software

417
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:50,079
licensing

418
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:53,839
but we should make that more transparent

419
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:53,839
and that's just the idea of reuse

420
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:59,839
questions other questions

421
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:05,120
there could also be different licenses

422
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:08,160
within a file right

423
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:11,040
like uh stack overflow has

424
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:12,399
you know you can copy code from there as

425
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:15,040
long as it's tributed

426
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:16,639
or things like that does the reuse

427
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,000
handle any of that

428
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:19,519
unfortunately not but that's a really

429
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
cool question that we also want to work

430
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:22,720
on

431
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,480
um the idea that we had is to have

432
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,639
something like a

433
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,959
here begins code under this copyright

434
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:30,560
and this license and here dance

435
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:32,479
that would be great like right now the

436
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,920
reuse tool at least

437
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,759
you could do that already but the reuse

438
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:38,000
tool doesn't really detect

439
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:39,680
whether a license is split in multiple

440
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,279
snippets for instance

441
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,880
you could do that manually somehow but

442
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:45,199
the tool would will

443
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:47,120
search for this spdx license identifier

444
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:49,279
and for a copyright statement already

445
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,720
so it would at least carry the

446
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:51,680
information that there are multiple

447
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,399
licenses

448
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:55,199
in this file somehow but it's not like

449
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:56,880
really easy

450
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:58,240
yet but uh we can figure that out i

451
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:01,199
think there's already an open

452
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,680
uh issue for that so if someone has a

453
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:03,758
really

454
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,959
good idea please uh please help us it

455
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:06,000
would be great

456
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:20,000
okay thank you very much that's all the

457
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:20,000
time we have for questions thank you
