1
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:09,519
uh thank you thank you for the

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,599
introduction

3
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:13,360
so um you know a lot of the talks have

4
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:16,000
been in today's room have been about

5
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:17,919
uh pcb design tools and things like that

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,480
we're going to go even lower than that

7
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,199
we're going to talk about building chips

8
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,400
asics

9
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:27,199
with open source tools and open piton is

10
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:29,119
not an open source

11
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:30,960
cad tool but it is being used by a lot

12
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:33,760
of open source cad tools right now as

13
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,360
a uh the test suite for that so what is

14
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,399
open piton well open piton is the

15
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,519
world's first open source

16
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:38,399
general-purpose multi-thread in many

17
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,879
core but it's

18
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,000
if you think about it it's really a

19
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:44,718
best-of-breed sort of

20
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,840
mini core architecture design where you

21
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:47,520
have lots of different cores general

22
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,079
purpose cores that you can hit uh put

23
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,000
together

24
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:51,520
all written in verilog hdl and all open

25
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,719
source uh so our

26
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:56,480
uh design uh the the core of it or sorry

27
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,960
about the core the uh most of it is a

28
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,398
bsd license and one of the cores is

29
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,879
gpl and some of the other cores are

30
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:05,119
solder pad but we can actually eat in

31
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:06,960
lots of different uh cores now so now we

32
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:09,040
actually have 10 different core types

33
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,399
microprocessor core types excuse me with

34
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,280
four different instruction set

35
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,640
architectures

36
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,320
and was designed to be scalable so it

37
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,119
scales up to about a half billion cores

38
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:17,360
but i don't really

39
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:18,720
recommend actually trying to build that

40
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,080
um but uh

41
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,400
the the secret sauce here is that you

42
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:24,479
can actually have a configurable

43
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,159
and cache coherent interface where you

44
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:27,840
can hook together lots of cores in a

45
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,320
we'll show some pictures of us in a 2d

46
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,400
mesh design and build very large

47
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,360
chips and it's all open source so so you

48
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,799
can use this

49
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,320
in your open source cad tools and in

50
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,200
fact i will be talking about the end of

51
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:40,479
today's talk

52
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:42,079
that there is a bunch is a big movement

53
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:45,280
now for open source

54
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:48,320
eda hardware tools and they're using

55
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:50,079
uh open piton as the the development

56
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,600
test for that and i'll talk a little bit

57
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:53,600
about that um

58
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,798
some other sort of things is this is as

59
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,000
i said sort of chip level

60
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:57,200
we've actually built these some of these

61
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,119
chips and i'll talk about that in a

62
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,320
second but from a simulation perspective

63
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:03,439
we support all the

64
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:05,919
uh commercial and uh open source

65
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:06,839
uh simulators these days for for verilog

66
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,039
so the the

67
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,319
the uh we have icarus ferrolog and

68
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:12,799
verilater are some of the

69
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:13,679
the two sort of most popular open source

70
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,760
uh

71
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:20,000
eda uh verilog simulators uh these days

72
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,679
it's this design has been asic verified

73
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,560
and fpga verified and we'll talk about

74
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,160
that in a second

75
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,000
and we've done very careful power

76
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,760
analysis um

77
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,280
on actual asic we've built and cross

78
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:32,720
referenced that with the open source

79
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:34,560
uh design so you can go and and use that

80
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,760
to make sure your tools your eda tools

81
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,640
are doing the right thing because that's

82
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,160
really important because you want to

83
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,879
have sort of a design reference of maybe

84
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,319
something

85
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:41,840
that may have went through a commercial

86
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:43,200
tool and see if that actually you're

87
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,400
getting good quality results or

88
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,160
something like that

89
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,519
from from this whole thing and i should

90
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,359
also say you know this runs

91
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:50,800
full stack debian linux it's a full uh

92
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,200
working uh

93
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,959
mini core design with uh you know we've

94
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,518
built chips with 25 cores we can scale

95
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,159
up to

96
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:59,760
you know many many more of course so

97
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:01,519
that's all from piton well we took open

98
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,720
piton and we extended it

99
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:04,080
and started adding more cores the

100
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,840
original open pizzan actually used an

101
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,640
open spark core so sparks are open

102
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,400
instruction sets

103
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,920
that the old you know sun systems used

104
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,000
to use and uh

105
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:13,920
sun had open sourced that at some point

106
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,599
and now um we've extended it you know

107
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,119
risk five is sort of becoming

108
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:18,799
hot these days so we wanted to add in

109
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,480
sort of risk five support

110
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,920
because in reality open piton we don't

111
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,119
really care that much about the core we

112
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,559
care much more about the encore in

113
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,120
building a scalable encore

114
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,239
so we took uh in a collaboration with

115
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,519
eth zurich

116
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:34,159
and the pulp team and integrated the

117
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:35,840
ariane core so the ariane core is a

118
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:38,319
general purpose 64-bit

119
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,319
uh risc-5 processor which we've

120
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:42,399
integrated in collaboration with uh

121
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:44,079
eth zurich and the pulp team as i said

122
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,360
before and what was actually really kind

123
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,720
of cool about this is we were able to do

124
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,159
this integration and it took us

125
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,840
less than six months from the time we

126
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:51,519
started integrating our our

127
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,280
registered transfer language verilog

128
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:56,959
code to the point where we actually had

129
00:03:53,280 --> 00:04:00,560
a working design in fpga booting

130
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:01,519
smp linux so these are silicone proven

131
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,879
designs and that's something you really

132
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:04,959
need if you're going to go build

133
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:06,798
and use your open source cad tool is you

134
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:08,879
know has this actually is this

135
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:09,920
uh real designs is it not just synthetic

136
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:11,439
design so i'll talk a little bit about

137
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,040
synthetic designs in a second of why

138
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:16,399
that's not really great for using

139
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:17,680
uh for your cad tools so

140
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:19,839
one of the sort of chips we built well

141
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:24,160
we built uh the piton processor

142
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:27,039
at princeton which is a 25 core

143
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,880
mini core implementation of this it uses

144
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,320
three on-chip networks a directory-based

145
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:32,960
cache coherence system

146
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,599
this was taped out in ibm's 32 nanometer

147
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,560
process

148
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,919
a few years back and it was about 460

149
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,440
million transistors which is one of the

150
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:43,599
largest academic chips

151
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:46,880
uh ever built um

152
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,199
at eth zurich the arion team has taped

153
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,680
out

154
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:50,880
a couple different variants one named

155
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,440
poseidon one named

156
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,000
cosmodrome where arion sort of shows up

157
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:57,600
as

158
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,960
processors used in the eth zurich work

159
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,720
and now we're actually working to sort

160
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,599
of build uh chips together and we'll be

161
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,560
taping out

162
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,120
uh this year some open piton plus ariane

163
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,560
designs

164
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:10,000
in a 12 nanometer process

165
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,400
so as i said you know you want to not

166
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,960
just target uh or be a good

167
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,479
open source uh uh design just for asic

168
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,198
design you also want to you know be good

169
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:20,719
for

170
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:22,720
uh the fpga world so uh

171
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,400
we mapped to a bunch of different fpgas

172
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,880
we've shown this so we have things from

173
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,719
sort of

174
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:29,039
one two cores and relatively inexpensive

175
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:32,560
boards uh all the way up to

176
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:33,680
many cores or well 12 cores and sort of

177
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,840
quite expensive

178
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,120
boards and the other thing that uh we've

179
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,758
been talking about recently i have done

180
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,800
recently is

181
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:43,360
we now uh have this on amazon f1 so

182
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,080
in amazon aws or amazon web services you

183
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,240
can rent

184
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:48,080
a fpga in the cloud for about a dollar

185
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,960
60 an hour i don't know what it is in

186
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,280
the european

187
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,239
uh world if they have actually the f1

188
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,119
instances they might just be in the

189
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,960
states but

190
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,800
you can use those and rent it and then

191
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:59,198
you don't need to own a 8 000

192
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,919
test board to go do this you can go rent

193
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,800
some

194
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:03,198
you know dollar 60 an hour prorated

195
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,880
board

196
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:06,479
which then you can go use and actually

197
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,680
develop and sort of test out these types

198
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:10,240
of things

199
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:12,000
okay so what's what's sort of the the

200
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:15,520
design system here in open p time

201
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,039
as i said it's a uh 2d mesh structure so

202
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:20,159
each of these things is a

203
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:21,680
tile inside of a tile we have uh network

204
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,680
on chip routers let me

205
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,600
zoom in here for a second so we have

206
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:29,039
three routers we have

207
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:32,080
a slice of a last level shared

208
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:33,280
cache with a directory and then we have

209
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,840
a private cache

210
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:37,440
and we have uh the core here and then we

211
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,799
have a lot of off chip chipset

212
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,800
stuff which is actually really helpful

213
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,680
if you're trying to go build a cad tool

214
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,720
you don't just want

215
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,880
cores and you just don't want

216
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,240
interconnect you want sort of everything

217
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,280
to go test your cad tools we've got a

218
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,720
lot of feedback from people who are

219
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,919
using this that they actually want the

220
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,440
variety of all the things you could

221
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:52,960
possibly sort of put together

222
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,880
so this is sort of the open p-town

223
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,840
system nowadays we're doing open pizza

224
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,120
plus ariane so

225
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,960
literally we just sort of took open

226
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,199
piton ripped it or sorry took the open

227
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:04,239
spark core ripped it out and put in

228
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:06,000
the uh ariane core and and

229
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,280
there's a lot of uh work that went into

230
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,160
that it's not quite as easy just ripping

231
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,159
out and putting it

232
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,400
uh but we have a paper uh coming out at

233
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:14,800
together with uh the eth zurich team

234
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:16,000
at askplus uh in two months where we

235
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,360
talk a lot about how to

236
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,880
go do that and build the infrastructure

237
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,360
we can plug in lots of different core

238
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,479
types

239
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:24,000
which are vastly different okay so this

240
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:25,440
brings me up to the sort of cad world

241
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,400
here so what is the

242
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,400
we've heard a lot about

243
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:33,199
eda tools for pcbs

244
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:35,680
what's the state of the art sort of uh

245
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:37,440
in the chip world well

246
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,880
they're used but maybe not anyone's

247
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,840
actually sort of taping out chips right

248
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,319
now with that and that's

249
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,960
that's sad in my opinion um and what's

250
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:44,319
missing well

251
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,000
we've had a lot of tools for from

252
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:48,720
academic groups for verification

253
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,720
we have open source flow for uh some

254
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,560
very small fpgas these days

255
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,599
um but you know in reality we want to

256
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,400
sort of get to the point where we can

257
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,240
tape out

258
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:58,080
large uh chips least academic chips or

259
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,560
maybe commercial chips with a full open

260
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,758
source

261
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:04,000
uh eda tool flow for the chips

262
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:05,440
side so when people have traditionally

263
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,280
tested these things they are

264
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:09,919
a lot of times been using sort of old

265
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:12,239
industrial designs to go do their tests

266
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:13,440
and one of the things or they're using

267
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,560
old academic designs

268
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,160
and one of the biggest problems here is

269
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,440
they're really limited in scale so if

270
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:20,000
you go look at sort of

271
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,599
the designs out there that people have

272
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,080
used traditionally to test

273
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:24,800
eda tools in academia they're using sort

274
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,440
of

275
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,560
example designs or they're using very

276
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,000
small designs or they're using

277
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,720
obfuscated designs that are coming from

278
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,320
industry

279
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,760
that are not particularly open or

280
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,640
realistic they're typically very

281
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,399
synthetic and

282
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,679
we see uh you know open pizza and open

283
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:39,279
pizza plus arion

284
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:40,399
as a mechanism to get like real designs

285
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:42,640
that people have actually taped out and

286
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:45,120
can scale the big design points

287
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:47,279
going through large chip flows open

288
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,959
source chip flows

289
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:50,800
okay so you know what what is really

290
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:53,119
needed here to be a good

291
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:55,439
benchmark or good use case for open

292
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:58,000
source eda

293
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,040
chip cad flows first thing you want is

294
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,839
you want a lot of different design

295
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,760
variety

296
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:04,240
and we provide that so we have big cores

297
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:05,279
we have small cores we have caches we

298
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,959
have interconnect we have

299
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:10,480
actually a gp gpu which is connected

300
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:12,560
into this we have a different io

301
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,160
and we now have adding different

302
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:17,040
accelerators into this design mix

303
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:18,319
so you can basically build complex socs

304
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,439
out of this design point

305
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,800
and we're going to be taping out some of

306
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,560
them so that people can use them as

307
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,240
reference points

308
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,839
you also want a lot of configurability

309
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,360
so you want to be able to uh you know

310
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:28,720
change up different design points

311
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,240
because we've heard back from the people

312
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,680
that are sort of using this

313
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,160
that you know you want to be able to

314
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:35,519
sort of uh try different scale and try

315
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,120
small scale first and then

316
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:38,560
as you get bigger and bigger and you

317
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:41,200
want to like look at you know

318
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:42,719
what's going on you want to you know try

319
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,480
and stress your drc

320
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,480
checking at the scale but you also want

321
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,920
to test it in the sort of small case

322
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,680
first so we want to have this different

323
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:52,160
scale and you know we can

324
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:53,599
build big designs or big you know real

325
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,839
designs that will work and

326
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,880
and at least in simulation you know uh

327
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:59,279
uh you know

328
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:01,040
run real programs but you know uh no one

329
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:02,480
has a 500 million core design really

330
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,000
out there yet because you know moore's

331
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,800
law has ended you can't go build chips

332
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,519
that big

333
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,319
um okay so it opens up it's not just

334
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:10,480
verilog

335
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,920
we also give out all of the

336
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,680
accoutrements you might need

337
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,120
so we have verification test benches we

338
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,920
have eight over eight thousand test

339
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,880
cases

340
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:20,959
um so if you're building for instance a

341
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:24,399
open source verification tool

342
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:26,000
that does the cad side um you have test

343
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:27,440
cases for that uh we also have the power

344
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,680
analysis and thermal analysis

345
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:31,040
and we have some pcb designs that uh for

346
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,680
those of you who do build pcb designs

347
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,360
you should

348
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,519
you know please take a look at our you

349
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,720
know boards as uh input for that they're

350
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:37,920
pretty complicated design so they're

351
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,720
like 14 layer

352
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,279
pcbs that are uh but they're all open

353
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,160
and out there

354
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:45,439
if you want our website so there's an

355
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,880
example of one of the boards here you

356
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,360
know a pretty complex

357
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,560
test board that we use to do this sort

358
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,720
of careful

359
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:54,880
power analysis and you know we've taken

360
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,640
this whole piton chip and done

361
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:59,279
careful power analysis and sort of come

362
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:00,720
up with good ground truth

363
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:02,560
so what is a good ground truth here so

364
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:05,760
for instance we measured

365
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:06,239
the energy per hop on your network on

366
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,360
chip

367
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,839
so if you're going to build a best of

368
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,959
breed network these days you can go and

369
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:12,560
actually go look at our paper

370
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:14,560
it'll tell you sort of how much energy

371
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:16,719
is used for that and in reality

372
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,079
it's about eight uh you can go about

373
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:20,079
eight hops on our knock

374
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:21,760
or network on chip for the energy

375
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:23,279
equivalent of one let's say alu and

376
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:25,200
that's amongst the myth of

377
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:26,560
that knocks are really expensive from an

378
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,839
energy perspective it's just this is not

379
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,959
true

380
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:30,560
also you know we've done a fair amount

381
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:30,880
of thermal analysis sort of you can see

382
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,800
the

383
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:34,240
nice thermal pictures here um but we've

384
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,000
also sort of looked at how much energy

385
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:39,920
it takes to loads versus stores

386
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,279
and different instruction energy usages

387
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,640
and it's really important that this is

388
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:43,040
open source because when we were doing

389
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,600
this

390
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,599
you know we were doing the

391
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,360
characterization well we designed it so

392
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,560
we can go look at it but if

393
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,079
if it wasn't open source it wouldn't be

394
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,119
that useful to have these sort of

395
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:53,760
on-chip network

396
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,639
energy numbers and and uh instruction

397
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,839
energy numbers because you wouldn't be

398
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:57,040
able to go look in the design but

399
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:58,639
because it's all open source you can go

400
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,760
look at it

401
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:01,839
okay so this brings us a little bit back

402
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,680
to the eda tools here you know we

403
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:05,040
use a lot of these tools and this is

404
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:08,800
actually a part of

405
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:10,160
a big darpa program called idea where

406
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,800
people are building lots of different

407
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:15,760
cad design tools that are open source

408
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:17,279
and we're uh the design advisors so

409
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,480
we're giving a lot of this advice and

410
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:20,560
designs out to

411
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,600
the users so we use lots of different

412
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,760
open source uh

413
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,800
uh tools here and we're not just using

414
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,680
it but we're actually contributing back

415
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,279
so we've actually

416
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,800
filed a bunch of bug reports against all

417
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:30,079
these uh different open source tools

418
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,519
here

419
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:33,279
and you know we really need as just

420
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:34,480
going back to uh just sort of uh running

421
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:36,000
out of time here but to sum up that you

422
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,399
know we want to go back to

423
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,200
sort of think about what do we need to

424
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:42,720
have a full

425
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:44,240
open source chip cad flow which is

426
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,920
a lot you know there's a lot of problems

427
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,440
you need to go solve there so

428
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:49,199
actually the right here is a picture of

429
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:51,600
our

430
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,800
cad flow we use sort of commercially and

431
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,399
then we're sort of

432
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,319
taking all that input and thinking what

433
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:59,040
do we need in

434
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:00,160
the open source world and you need uh

435
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,920
you know

436
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,600
hierarchical synthesis you need you know

437
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,079
two past designs you need to be able to

438
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,639
do

439
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:08,079
engineering change orders um and you

440
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:08,720
need you know good support for gate

441
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:10,000
level

442
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,279
verification and this is all these

443
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,839
things that a lot of these open source

444
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:14,639
tools

445
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:16,480
don't currently support so what is

446
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:18,000
missing and what is sort of coming along

447
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,760
here so make a plug for actually two

448
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,680
programs that are not mine

449
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:23,760
they're not collaborators but but

450
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:28,239
they're people i know well

451
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:30,880
so the first is um uc san diego led by

452
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,160
andrew kong has been building this thing

453
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,760
called open road which is

454
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,199
the closest that we actually have today

455
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:37,519
to a full

456
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,880
chip eda cad flow and we're working with

457
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:40,000
them giving them designs

458
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,360
that they're actually going to tape out

459
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
and then we're using their tools and

460
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,480
we're going to tape

461
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,040
out some chips with full open source

462
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:48,720
chip level

463
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:51,279
eda cad tools also

464
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:53,279
the university of washington under uh as

465
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:56,399
a subcontractor under my program

466
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:58,160
has been building a

467
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:59,519
basically packaging of those tools to go

468
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,199
build a full flow because it's not

469
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:02,800
enough just to have the tools

470
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:04,319
this is something you learn as you're

471
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,760
sort of in the chip business is the

472
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,360
tools are just the tools

473
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,880
the glue that holds it together if the

474
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,079
flow and how do you put together tools

475
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,680
and how to use all the flags

476
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:14,079
is actually more important basically the

477
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:15,439
tools are just as important as the tools

478
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:17,199
because it takes years to sort of

479
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:19,040
develop so we're we're

480
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:20,719
you know expert chip designers and we're

481
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,480
using these tools and sort of building

482
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,920
that flow for the open source world and

483
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,839
uh uh mike tellers group university

484
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,240
washington has released that uh down

485
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:27,920
here

486
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:31,279
uh using the open road package together

487
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:33,839
with a uh free nan

488
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:34,720
a 45 nanometer fake library that's free

489
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:36,800
that people can use

490
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,240
to go test this out together what's

491
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:41,920
missing okay so

492
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:43,519
um let's say the open road design is the

493
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:45,120
you know most advanced sort of chip

494
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:46,720
level open source cad tools out there

495
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:49,440
but still a lot of things missing

496
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,839
so first of all um there is no drc tool

497
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,240
uh

498
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:52,880
for uh chip level drc that exists today

499
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,920
you know the

500
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:57,279
drc decks are really complex especially

501
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,120
you know we're taping out stuff in 12

502
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:00,399
nanometer it's all finfet stuff the

503
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,920
rules like you go read the

504
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:03,680
the manual and you can't understand some

505
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,479
of the rules right so the you know very

506
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:07,839
complicated

507
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,240
uh drc decks so you need we need a drc

508
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:10,320
tool

509
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,279
uh second you know yosis is great but we

510
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,199
need yosas to be

511
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:14,480
uh even even better we found lots of

512
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:16,079
problems with yosis

513
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,680
um in particular i mean it's not just

514
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:18,560
like systematic support let's say we get

515
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:21,279
around that

516
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:22,638
um but uh you know we we've seen

517
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:24,880
recently something where the

518
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:26,560
way they do asynchronous clocking just

519
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,680
doesn't really make sense to us even for

520
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:29,119
you know synchronous circuits like the

521
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,160
asynchronous reset just kind of doesn't

522
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:33,199
make sense

523
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:35,040
um and then uh parasitic

524
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:36,399
tools better system verilog support

525
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,680
that's actually coming along a little

526
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:39,279
faster than i was expecting

527
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,880
and then things that people don't um

528
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:42,079
really think about is sort of parasitic

529
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:44,000
extraction at the chip level

530
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:46,479
i think there's a talk about parasitic

531
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,560
extraction or 3d uh

532
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,839
field modeling here in this session uh

533
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,439
but at the chip level it's actually

534
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:52,560
pretty uh it's a slightly different game

535
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:55,360
than the board level

536
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:56,719
and then uh power grid and single signal

537
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,240
integrity issues

538
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,160
so we're building a billion transistor

539
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,839
chip with the open source uh

540
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:04,000
open flow tools we're taping this out in

541
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:05,920
global foundry's 12 nanometer

542
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,079
really excited to go do this and then i

543
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:11,599
want to make a final plug here for

544
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:14,319
we are also here today

545
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,600
as part of the decades project which i

546
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,040
also lead now

547
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,399
in the darpa sdh software defined

548
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,839
hardware program where we're also

549
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:21,440
looking at all these open source designs

550
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:23,279
and the open piton design

551
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,880
used to go build a heterogeneous many

552
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:26,560
core platform

553
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:28,000
okay so we have a whole community thing

554
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,800
about a time but you know you can go to

555
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,959
our git

556
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:32,079
hub page i want to acknowledge all the

557
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:33,758
great students

558
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:36,000
that have gone into this we like to go

559
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:37,519
do fun things we went camping at the at

560
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,800
the grand canyon this year

561
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:42,079
um and the ariane team and the uh

562
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,439
university of washington team and then

563
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:44,079
finally open road is doing some really

564
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,800
great stuff

565
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:49,359
um you should all go check out open road

566
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,310
okay anything amount of time so i will

567
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:58,620
end there

568
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:58,619
[Applause]

569
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:03,440
so you're taking out these chips for to

570
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:06,000
validate your your research

571
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:08,160
i guess is that why that you do the act

572
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,919
like silicon tape out or

573
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,280
you're saying why uh so the question is

574
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:12,799
why are we taping out

575
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,559
chips i guess i'm trying to get a sense

576
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:15,439
of i know like for academics they do

577
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:18,480
like low volume

578
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:20,640
take outs but and then at one point

579
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,760
would you like with this transition into

580
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,679
maybe a commercial

581
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:25,359
product or something okay so so why i

582
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:26,240
guess so repeat the question you know

583
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:27,839
why

584
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:30,000
are academics building very large

585
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:32,159
billion transistor chips and

586
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,760
you know when does this transition to

587
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:37,280
industry i guess is the question

588
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:38,000
um yeah so um my research is computer

589
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,600
architecture

590
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,280
primarily so we want to test out new

591
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,840
computer architecture ideas

592
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:45,200
um you can simulate that but a lot of

593
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:47,840
times the intuition is

594
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:49,120
is wrong from the simulation or you miss

595
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,159
a lot of details when you don't actually

596
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,360
go implement it

597
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,880
um so a lot of people do sort of

598
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,000
software level simulation of

599
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,640
architectural ideas

600
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,760
and doesn't capture enough of what the

601
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,360
real problems are

602
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:01,360
uh when you actually sort of physically

603
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:04,080
build it so that's sort of

604
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,559
the one answer the commercialization um

605
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,159
question

606
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:08,160
i've commercialized things i've built in

607
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,520
academia before so many years ago in

608
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,039
graduate school i

609
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:13,200
worked in the mit raw processor which

610
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:16,160
got commercialized in the tyler chip

611
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:17,520
so things can spin out um in academia

612
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,799
that's not our goal our goal is yeah you

613
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:21,840
know we get back

614
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:23,520
you know 40 to 100 die um and we

615
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:25,280
typically use shuttle runs so shuttle

616
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,080
runs our multi-project wafer aggregation

617
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:28,160
is where you have lots of different

618
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:29,600
designs they aggregated together

619
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,640
as you're wearing an ash park shirt well

620
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,600
ash park does the same thing at the

621
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,600
board level

622
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:35,360
um but at the chip level that's pretty

623
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,199
common um

624
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,799
but then uh yeah you can go commercial i

625
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:41,679
mean this stuff's sort of

626
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:43,039
commercial level uh ideas here but it's

627
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:46,880
really a test on new architecture

628
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:48,240
uh ideas how do you see the interface

629
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,840
with the founders when you need to get

630
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:53,600
the predictions from the founders to see

631
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:56,639
yeah that's a great question here so um

632
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:57,918
oh sorry um how how uh as

633
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,840
academic how do we integrate with the

634
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:01,840
foundries and how do we get the pdks and

635
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:03,039
it's not just the pdks it's also the uh

636
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,879
intellectual property that you

637
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:06,720
otherwise need so the pdk is just the

638
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:09,520
design rules you also need like

639
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,559
standard cells rams ios plls if you can

640
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:14,879
get one of those

641
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:18,080
uh things like that so um relationships

642
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,720
um so yeah we license it typically a lot

643
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:22,159
of stuff is

644
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:23,919
uh you know free for academic use but

645
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,679
there's also a lot of restrictions on it

646
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:26,880
um and

647
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:29,120
yeah you need to sort of work through

648
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,080
that it's not easy to get um the the

649
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:32,080
harder thing

650
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:33,840
maybe than just gaining access is

651
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:35,199
getting access to something as advanced

652
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,879
as like 12 nanometer

653
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,799
um so a lot of the foundries will not

654
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,000
give academics access to

655
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:42,080
anything that's sort of near the

656
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,440
bleeding edge and that 12 nanometer or

657
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,399
these for global foundries is their

658
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:47,280
bleeding edge

659
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,760
um so yeah those relationships you have

660
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,080
to know

661
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,879
you know uh people there i'll put a plug

662
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,960
in here i know

663
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:54,160
uh uh metro's sitting in the back of the

664
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:56,320
room there's

665
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:57,840
maybe some opportunities for other free

666
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,280
pdks coming along

667
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:01,199
um that's a problem you know it's their

668
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:03,440
proprietary ip of

669
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,280
you know one of the design rules for a

670
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:07,440
pdk and i don't know
