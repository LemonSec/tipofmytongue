1
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:10,480
good morning everyone

2
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:10,480
um yup microphones on

3
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:13,678
welcome and uh first of all thank you

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:17,920
for

5
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,920
xwiki to organize this deaf room

6
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:24,080
my name is sandra van durin and

7
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:24,720
i today i'll show a bit of the things

8
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:28,000
that we've done

9
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:30,000
during the last few years for a project

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,880
at the european commission

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,320
my colleague is here as well i might

12
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,320
pass down some questions to him

13
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,879
so it's a project that we've been doing

14
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:43,760
for a few years and

15
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:45,360
well some well we discovered some

16
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:48,559
interesting things with

17
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:51,760
integrating a knowledge graph with a cms

18
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:56,000
so who am i um

19
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:58,480
my name is sander i live close by 11.

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,239
i'm an independent consultant so i'm not

21
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,440
representing the european commission

22
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:03,919
here in any way

23
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,959
it's just uh some of the things that we

24
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:08,799
did there

25
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:12,080
um i'm working there on

26
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:15,360
software architecture and i

27
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:19,360
well apart from that i have a

28
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:20,560
i'm intrigued by all sorts of complex

29
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,880
systems

30
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,320
so and these are the contacts i put the

31
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:27,039
slides on

32
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:28,399
penta but i noticed that i forgot to put

33
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,720
the file extension there

34
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,680
so if you get the if you download if you

35
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:35,119
would download them

36
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,479
just put pptx behind i tried to change

37
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:39,040
it but uh the system

38
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:41,200
um well it was a bit overloaded this

39
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:44,799
morning so

40
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:48,159
i lost that opportunity so

41
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:51,200
um the place where i work is

42
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:52,320
is isa it's a unit that promotes

43
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,520
everything open

44
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:59,119
from the european commission side so we

45
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:02,399
work on open source projects um

46
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:05,200
so the goal is really uh to promote

47
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:08,239
interoperability between public services

48
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:11,280
so that can be on

49
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:15,440
data models but well

50
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:18,000
one of the things that we have is the

51
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,520
interoperability framework we have a

52
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,520
reference architecture that

53
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:24,080
supplements that framework all of these

54
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,920
things are clickable in the slides but

55
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,720
i i'll skip quickly through it because

56
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,238
there is not a lot of time

57
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,920
the main thing i wanted to point out

58
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,800
here is join up because that's the

59
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,440
action that actually where we did all of

60
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,080
this

61
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,840
work for and that's the content

62
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,720
management system

63
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,760
that is based on drupal and one

64
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:47,040
particular thing

65
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:49,599
that might be of interest

66
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,440
of to you outside of the technology

67
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:53,839
behind it

68
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,720
is the licensing assistant that we have

69
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,920
on on this

70
00:02:54,720 --> 00:03:00,080
platform which is a sort of a wizard

71
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,359
that helps you in selecting an open

72
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,480
source license

73
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:06,080
so if you're if you want to see based on

74
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:08,319
the criteria

75
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,720
it helps you determine what is the best

76
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:13,440
license for you

77
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:15,359
so a quick agenda what are knowledge

78
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:18,959
graphs

79
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:21,760
how does drupal and the cms world um

80
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:23,440
integrate with this from how we and how

81
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:26,560
we put everything together in one

82
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:27,440
system architecture so the the how

83
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,560
things

84
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:32,720
uh relate to each other um some

85
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,120
conclusions and then the question and

86
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,120
answers

87
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:41,200
knowledge crafts well

88
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,879
what is a knowledge graph i don't know

89
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:46,079
how familiar people are with

90
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:48,798
the concept but i'll

91
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,599
try to explain quickly what what goes

92
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:53,120
into it

93
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:53,119
it is in fact a

94
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,200
list of statements and a statement can

95
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:00,640
be something

96
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:04,000
of the form aw 120

97
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:06,720
is a room in ulb and you will see that i

98
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,560
i underlined parts of the statement and

99
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:12,799
another part is

100
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:13,040
in italics um this is really to indicate

101
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:15,040
that

102
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,798
well in this small sentence in this

103
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,399
statement there is a subject

104
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:20,880
there is a predicate and there is an

105
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:23,280
object and i'll come back to this

106
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,280
later

107
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,880
our knowledge graph something new

108
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:32,080
absolutely not um

109
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:35,199
they're sort of rebranded uh

110
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:38,400
of what semantic web was in

111
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:40,400
around the 2010s so i

112
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,599
probably somebody at gartner decided

113
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,039
that it was time for some new

114
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,680
terminology and

115
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,800
introduced knowledge graphs the big

116
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,919
difference with

117
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:52,800
the 2010s is that at least now there is

118
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:53,840
a decent set of tooling around the whole

119
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:57,199
concept

120
00:04:53,840 --> 00:05:00,159
so now you can really uh

121
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,960
work with these things so we have

122
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,600
statements

123
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:05,039
um if we throw these statements together

124
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,479
they form a graph

125
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:10,080
and that is our knowledge graph

126
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:12,240
you'll see different kind of terms

127
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:14,880
thrown around so linked

128
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,000
linked data linked open data semantic

129
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:19,039
web knowledge graphs

130
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,520
rdf all of those things are just you

131
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:21,840
know

132
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,639
synonyms for the same thing well they're

133
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:26,560
not

134
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:29,680
a hundred percent um but they covered uh

135
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:32,000
if you look around on the web these are

136
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:34,800
all sorts of terms used for the same

137
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,800
kind of ids

138
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:39,440
everything in knowledge graphs and that

139
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,080
is what this makes it particularly

140
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,960
interesting

141
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:46,240
is based on standards while a lot of

142
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:47,198
graph databases to think uh the neo4js

143
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,680
and

144
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:51,199
they are based on very loose well they

145
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:54,880
define their own standards

146
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:58,639
and but what we use on the

147
00:05:54,880 --> 00:06:00,080
on the semantic web is really w3c

148
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:03,520
standards like

149
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:06,800
yeah you would have html but

150
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:08,159
so the information itself is described

151
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:11,120
in rdf

152
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:13,120
and that is a specification which is uh

153
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,680
which makes it very robust and i mean

154
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:18,080
very portable

155
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:20,400
uh so we have rdf that is the

156
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,919
specification that defines how you can

157
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,679
express statements within the knowledge

158
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:26,799
graph we have

159
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:28,880
of course those statements we can make

160
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,240
arbitrary statements but things get a

161
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:33,360
bit more interesting

162
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:36,560
if we put things in a data model that's

163
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:39,120
where uh rdfs and i'll come in they

164
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,080
allow you to express uh classes of

165
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,280
things and how

166
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:45,120
you can instantiate things you need a

167
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,719
way to query all of this madness and

168
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,960
that is what sparkle is

169
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,880
sparkle is also very standardized so

170
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,520
it's an it's a standardized query

171
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:56,719
language

172
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:58,719
uh that allows you to query uh rdf data

173
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:01,120
and really what it all comes down to is

174
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:05,039
uh rdf is to information on the web

175
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:07,360
what html is to documents documents

176
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:08,159
express are a way of expressing

177
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,840
information

178
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:16,080
about a resource so an

179
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:18,159
uri on the web is a universal resource

180
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:20,960
indicator so it's really the identifier

181
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,800
of of a resource and a document is a way

182
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:25,680
of representing a resource

183
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,400
and the same way we can represent a

184
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,720
resource

185
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,758
with a document we can also represent it

186
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:33,120
with rdf

187
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:34,080
so a machine readable version so the

188
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,560
information is

189
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:38,000
readable for the machines instead of

190
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:41,759
html documents

191
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,759
that are readable for humans

192
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:49,120
how does rdf work uh if we see here our

193
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:50,960
table of beers um

194
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,280
some might be familiar of yesterday

195
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:56,719
evening

196
00:07:53,280 --> 00:08:00,159
what we do to express a tabular form in

197
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:03,199
in rdf diys we take our id we form it

198
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:04,960
we turn it into a uri so we put

199
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:06,639
something it looks like url but it

200
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:09,680
doesn't necessarily

201
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:13,440
point to a document on the web we

202
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:15,039
take our column name and we turn that

203
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:18,080
into our predicate

204
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:21,360
and then we take our value of the thing

205
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:25,120
and that we transform into an object

206
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:27,440
so in rdf we always have this form of

207
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,479
subject predicate object and this way we

208
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:32,479
can describe

209
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:35,439
whatever information that we want

210
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:36,159
sometimes this can get quite big because

211
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,599
you have to be

212
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:41,838
quite forbose in your in statements

213
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,640
but in the end you can with this simple

214
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:44,720
uh format

215
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:47,040
of of subject predicates object you can

216
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:49,200
model the whole world

217
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,560
objects uh is important to point out

218
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:53,519
everything here subjects

219
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,560
and predicates and objects can always be

220
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:56,480
your eyes

221
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,680
so subjects and predicates have to be

222
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,519
your eyes

223
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:01,599
uh objects on the other hand can be

224
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:05,120
either a uri or they can be

225
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:10,160
an xml type like a datetime or

226
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:10,160
or something of that yeah

227
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,720
then um what's all of this about well

228
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:18,000
the magic is really

229
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,000
in the in the u.s

230
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:22,399
since well you make a statement it's

231
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:25,040
somewhere on the you make something

232
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:25,519
a statement starting describing the

233
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:29,279
world

234
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:32,000
with your domain name as the first part

235
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:34,160
if you then if somebody else makes this

236
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,240
is describing data

237
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,360
in another domain well you know that

238
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,920
you'll be able to

239
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,640
merge everything conflict-free because

240
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,160
well you

241
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,680
you just have a list of statements on

242
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,600
one hand you have a state

243
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,959
list of statements uh coming from

244
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:52,480
another place

245
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:52,479
you can concatenate the two together

246
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,000
what is another very interesting aspect

247
00:09:55,279 --> 00:10:00,080
of

248
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:02,959
of having this things uh

249
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:06,320
displayed or represented with facts or

250
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:09,359
statements is that you can

251
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:11,200
build your applications in a way

252
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,560
because they they make they operate on

253
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,920
this graph of data

254
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:21,279
in a way that they ignore everything

255
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:24,160
that is um that it cannot understand

256
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:26,079
outside of the data model now rdf we can

257
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:29,519
represent it in multiple ways or

258
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:32,640
xml json turtle or any other

259
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:34,880
sort of serialization so if your

260
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:37,199
web service works with json you could

261
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:40,320
add a bit of context and

262
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:43,200
transform it into linked data or

263
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,839
graph representation i'll have to speed

264
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,680
up a bit

265
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:51,120
um why would you want to do it well

266
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:52,800
this idea of applications separating

267
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:56,240
your application from the data

268
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:58,319
is very important instead of

269
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:02,240
putting logic in your application layer

270
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:04,480
that knows how to interpret certain

271
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,680
structures in your database everything

272
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:08,800
is directly expressed

273
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:10,399
in the data itself and then as i

274
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,560
already mentioned well you have this

275
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:16,000
possibility of ignoring facts

276
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:18,640
so you can really sub class

277
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,279
or make application profiles of a data

278
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,959
model

279
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:22,800
and sort of specialize them for your

280
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:25,839
application context

281
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:28,399
so a very generic standard and then

282
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:29,440
make something for your application mis

283
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:32,240
add the missing

284
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,440
parts and then this data can still be

285
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:36,079
interpreted

286
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,560
by applications that handle that work on

287
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:39,760
this

288
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:40,959
generic data model by simply ignoring

289
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,720
the things that

290
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:45,199
that you stated that they cannot

291
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,200
understand

292
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,560
now well yeah the obvious the obvious

293
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,959
things that

294
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:55,040
big corporations are using knowledge

295
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:58,560
graphs for now are the

296
00:11:55,040 --> 00:12:01,120
um interactive assistants like the

297
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:02,079
uh the tiller screens of amazon that uh

298
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,720
you know the

299
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:06,620
what are they called the the things you

300
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,839
can talk to

301
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:11,120
[Music]

302
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:13,040
alexa then of course

303
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:15,200
google uses it to improve search because

304
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:16,719
well modeling knowledge and relating

305
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:19,519
things to each other you can

306
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:21,200
greatly increase your insight in how the

307
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:24,399
world

308
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,720
fits together and well chatbots are and

309
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:28,399
also

310
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:28,399
also an uh another example

311
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:33,279
so this is how you express a query i'm

312
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:36,839
just going to speed up a bit

313
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:38,240
uh coming to the drupal part of things

314
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:40,639
um

315
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:42,000
what did we do uh well we have this

316
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:45,040
project called join up

317
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,839
um where we have this catalog of

318
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:48,719
reusable

319
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:49,360
solutions uh open source we try to

320
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,320
express

321
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:54,079
everything uh there in a

322
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,959
machine-readable format so that people

323
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:58,479
can also use

324
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:59,760
reuse our catalog um and it is really a

325
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:02,079
federated portal so the

326
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:03,200
there are member states of the of the

327
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:05,359
european union

328
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:07,120
that have their own catalog and we

329
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:09,519
harvest data from them

330
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,959
and turn it uh throw it together into

331
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:14,399
one european

332
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:16,079
uh catalog it's licensed under upl

333
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:18,560
and it's open source if you grab the

334
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:21,839
slides you can click on all those things

335
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,839
and get to the github page

336
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:27,200
so what was really the the thing that

337
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,839
that

338
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,399
we we required well that were required

339
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:33,360
of

340
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:35,279
of us the team that was responsible of

341
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:38,399
of the implementation

342
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:40,160
well it has to be it the solution uh had

343
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:44,079
to be free and open source

344
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:47,279
um we were we had the requirement that

345
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:48,079
uh our project was had to be open source

346
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:51,199
which is

347
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:53,040
always of course very nice drupal was

348
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:54,000
part of the requirements because there

349
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:57,360
are a lot of

350
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,680
um there is a lot of knowledge

351
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:01,120
in the european commission on drupal

352
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:03,760
they know how to host it

353
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:06,000
well if you have a stack like this try

354
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:09,040
to reuse it

355
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,519
we had to publish our data as open data

356
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:12,639
so

357
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:15,839
hence the rdf part

358
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:19,360
and then harvesting of other catalog so

359
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:19,839
integrating data sources and of course

360
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,680
well

361
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:23,120
the whole solution had to stay

362
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:25,279
compatible with the

363
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,399
contributed modules in in the drupal

364
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:29,519
ecosystem

365
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:32,160
so that was another thing that we wanted

366
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:32,160
to safeguard

367
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:38,560
what did we do well we swapped out

368
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,920
the database layer of drupal so we wrote

369
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:42,560
our own

370
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:44,560
orm let's say we made a module that

371
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:48,319
plugs into drupal and

372
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:51,359
that simply instead of doing a sql

373
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:54,720
it does sparkle

374
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:57,600
and since it's drupal has a quite

375
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,240
well defined database abstraction layer

376
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,320
we can

377
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:02,800
we can now express the same type of

378
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:07,120
queries in the in the orm

379
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:07,120
as it would go to to a sql database

380
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:14,399
so whenever we hit save on on a form

381
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:16,560
it just goes goes to the to the

382
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:17,839
sparkle to the triple star database that

383
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:22,319
stores everything in rdf

384
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:22,800
instead of and that was really our goal

385
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,199
was

386
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,079
not to store any linked data concepts

387
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:28,639
outside of the

388
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:29,758
infrastructure layer not to use any of

389
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:32,000
those concepts

390
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:33,199
so it's a normal drupal site from the

391
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,720
outside

392
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:41,199
only on the infrastructure layer we have

393
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:44,720
link data things

394
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:46,000
gonna skip this coming to i it's not

395
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,959
very readable

396
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,000
the resolution got to me but what you

397
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:52,800
see here

398
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,079
is on the right side we have two

399
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,000
databases that we use

400
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:57,439
we store part of our content in a

401
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,639
relational database

402
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:02,800
and part of our content in a

403
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:05,440
triple store database and everything

404
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:07,199
fits them into the cms system

405
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:09,120
and we had to do a bit of trickery

406
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:09,599
because well if you have two completely

407
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,399
different

408
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:15,600
database technologies things get a bit

409
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:18,880
tricky if you have to do a query

410
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:21,199
so in the end we decided to well

411
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:23,360
let's index everything in apache solar

412
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:25,359
and we run our queries against solar

413
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,560
and then when we do object loads we just

414
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,880
get them from the

415
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:31,758
from the database and that worked out

416
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,759
perfectly fine

417
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:39,360
we also have a copy of this

418
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,240
triple store database that we put out in

419
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,800
the public

420
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,519
and and there we have our public sparkle

421
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:47,279
endpoint

422
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:50,160
so you can you can go and query this so

423
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:51,279
quickly some lessons learned our objects

424
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:53,920
well

425
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:54,480
everything all loads from the database

426
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:57,360
we

427
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:58,800
since drupal likes caching we ended up

428
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:01,600
with a reddit server so

429
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:02,719
in also our objects just gets cached in

430
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:06,079
in redis

431
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:07,600
and our queries go to to solar

432
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:09,359
so in the end the database the triple

433
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:10,000
store database and the mysql are just

434
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:12,159
sitting there

435
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,199
being idle only when somebody says

436
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:16,240
something

437
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:16,240
something gets written there

438
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,839
of course what i think is the huge

439
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:24,559
potential

440
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:26,879
for big organizations is this ability of

441
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:27,678
extending data models and still being

442
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,720
compatible

443
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:32,080
with with the base data model so imagine

444
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,880
you have 200 websites

445
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:35,600
in an organization every organizational

446
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:38,880
unit

447
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:42,240
has a different notion of what a news

448
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:44,880
item means this one director wants to

449
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:48,000
have a subtitle on his news

450
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,400
uh you can accommodate for this and

451
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,400
still

452
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,440
operate you can query on the corporate

453
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,679
level with uh

454
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,480
with the shared data model and on the

455
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:57,600
local level

456
00:17:54,480 --> 00:18:00,799
uh those specific websites can use their

457
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:03,678
specific models it's

458
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:05,520
awesome for data integration so our data

459
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:08,960
coming from the member states

460
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:11,600
we can just pipe it through and

461
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:14,160
get it all in our triple star database

462
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:16,719
of course with validation in the process

463
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,919
and working with reference data like we

464
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,799
have code lists of

465
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:21,600
countries uh languages these kind of

466
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:24,480
things

467
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:25,039
it's uh it's really enjoyable because we

468
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:28,160
can

469
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:29,840
we can simply um

470
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:32,559
remove everything related to a certain

471
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:34,879
topic and replace it with a new version

472
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:36,720
and everything is still there and

473
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:43,840
working

474
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:43,840
now let's have a round of questions

475
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,559
yep excellent

476
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,400
okay great can you say that you use both

477
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:57,520
uh relation

478
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:59,120
that face and a triple database is it

479
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:00,720
simple a matter of everything that the

480
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:02,959
system knows the

481
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:05,200
the apologies that it knows is the

482
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:06,640
relational database and all the

483
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,320
predicates that we don't know are the

484
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:11,919
triples or is it more complex than that

485
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:14,240
no so the question was um

486
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:15,200
is everything stored in every database

487
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:18,480
and or if

488
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:20,720
if the the if the is the data that we

489
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:23,440
cannot express in a relational model

490
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,840
stored in a date in the triple store or

491
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:27,039
where it

492
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:29,760
goes what kind of data the well

493
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:32,080
the the reality is that we have a part

494
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:35,120
of our

495
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:35,840
data model this standardized we use adms

496
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:38,879
ap

497
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:41,840
which is an um sort of

498
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,840
decat ap

499
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:47,039
variation and

500
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,960
all of the entities that are described

501
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:51,039
in this model which store in

502
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,400
in the triple store database everything

503
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:57,360
else news events

504
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:57,360
they go to the relational model

505
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,720
it was if we would have the the the

506
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:05,439
tooling that we built now

507
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:07,919
uh when we started probably we would

508
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:09,679
have expressed everything in rdf

509
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:12,080
um but at that time it was very

510
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:14,880
difficult to uh

511
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:15,600
to rely on the thing and things like

512
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:20,159
versioning

513
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:20,799
are also not so easy in rdf and that's

514
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:24,000
why we

515
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:24,000
decided to make the split

516
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,639
yup maybe

517
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:33,360
we're using virtuoso the open source

518
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:35,760
version

519
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:38,000
it was what was what we got our hands

520
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:39,360
out at the time and it was working fine

521
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,799
so

522
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:45,280
there's i think by now there are better

523
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:46,720
maybe better products on the market but

524
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:49,840
it's

525
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,840
it works fine

526
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,918
well virtuoso works works well it scales

527
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,000
pretty well

528
00:20:55,919 --> 00:21:00,840
uh it's still one of the most performant

529
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:04,159
ones it's just that the documentation is

530
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:06,879
horrible so that that was more the

531
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:08,640
challenge than uh

532
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:10,320
you had the questions so you mentioned

533
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:14,000
that you use solar

534
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:16,240
for for queries right yeah

535
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,000
does that mean solar of course is

536
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:21,200
document-based does that mean that

537
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:24,480
you have the simple queries

538
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:27,760
to work with or have you also

539
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:31,280
been supporting sparkle endpoints

540
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:35,600
so excellent

541
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:37,918
yeah yeah yeah so uh the question was um

542
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:40,320
can you do everything with solar because

543
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:44,159
the document it's a document database

544
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:45,360
and you sort of lose the expressivity of

545
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:48,640
sparkle

546
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:50,719
if i can summarize it well

547
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:52,480
we have parts since we don't have

548
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:55,919
everything in

549
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:59,600
in our triple store database we had to

550
00:21:55,919 --> 00:22:02,720
do something um drupal works very

551
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:05,280
entity based anyhow so it's not

552
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,760
it's more it's more a natural document

553
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:09,520
model

554
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:13,039
i would say than than really graph data

555
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:15,600
so it is already it's a bit it already

556
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:16,640
puts a bit of an opinion on what your

557
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:20,080
graph will look like

558
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:23,200
um but what we do offer

559
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:24,639
is for the so we have the one database

560
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:27,919
we have the other database

561
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:30,080
both of them have their query layer from

562
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:31,360
from drupal on top we have an object

563
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:33,120
model that is

564
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:34,559
similar that is the same for both of

565
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:37,918
them they're just

566
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:37,918
entities in the cms

567
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:41,360
we index everything in solar and and

568
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:44,480
then

569
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:47,120
well our queries don't go

570
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:48,240
pretty wild it's it's more retrieving

571
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:51,600
things related to

572
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:54,640
well um yeah it's

573
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:58,158
yeah it's just simple things actually

574
00:22:54,640 --> 00:23:00,960
um for the querying the solar um

575
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:01,440
the sparkle querying um we do offer a

576
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,760
public

577
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,720
sparkle endpoint which is a copy of all

578
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,559
the

579
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:08,000
of a subset of all the graphs we have in

580
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:11,200
our main triple

581
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:13,679
store so there you can

582
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,880
everybody who wants to have the fine

583
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:18,720
grain sparkle

584
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:22,880
things can can use that

585
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:37,520
any other questions or

586
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:39,600
can we start switching

587
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,600
you
