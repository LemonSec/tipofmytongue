1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,480
okay so we've got another lightning talk

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,400
on the pictor telescope a free to use an

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,320
open source radio telescope

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,400
great thank you very much uh hello

5
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,000
everyone my name is apostles uh

6
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:20,080
in this lighting talk i will present to

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,560
you a picture which is afraid to use an

8
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:24,639
open source radio telescope that allows

9
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:27,759
anyone from all around the world to

10
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:31,279
observe the radio sky for free

11
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:33,920
so let's start a little uh introduction

12
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:34,719
so this is our galaxy uh i think most of

13
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,440
you have already

14
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:38,800
seen this image maybe uh but how did we

15
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,160
take this image

16
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,559
well of course we didn't send a

17
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:45,760
spaceship there that's a bit too far

18
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:46,640
but uh so how did we compose it well we

19
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,440
synthesized it

20
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:51,120
this is an artist's conception uh mostly

21
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:54,399
using radio astronomy

22
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:56,718
uh so you know if you if you've seen the

23
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:57,440
the galaxy at night the milky way band

24
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:00,239
uh

25
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:02,160
you may not really be able to tell if we

26
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:04,080
even live in a spiral galaxy

27
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,240
so today we'll try to prove this to you

28
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,000
with a live observation

29
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,679
so let's start with the electromagnetic

30
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,439
spectrum i think you've all

31
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:14,720
seen this uh sketch uh so

32
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:16,399
in the middle part we have the visible

33
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:18,320
spectrum this is a spectrum that we see

34
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,240
with our own eyes

35
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:22,479
this is where most astronomy takes place

36
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:25,360
in and of course we have some

37
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:26,080
invisible wavelengths like x-rays gamma

38
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,000
rays infrared

39
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:31,280
ultraviolet microwaves and of course

40
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,680
radio which i will focus on today

41
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,759
so now under certain conditions hydro a

42
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,439
neutral hydrogen atom can emit radiation

43
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,400
a photon with a wavelength of 21

44
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:41,279
centimeters

45
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,759
is called the spin flip transition um

46
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,520
which is

47
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,200
responsible for the productions of the

48
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,000
of these waves and as you know our

49
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,960
galaxy is

50
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,680
full of hot full of hydrogen so we can

51
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,839
detect the

52
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,119
these spiral arms you see this is an old

53
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,360
sky map and

54
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:57,119
in the center we have the milky way

55
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:59,040
hence why it's so uh bright and

56
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:00,479
at 420 megahertz this is this

57
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,600
corresponds to wavelength of 21

58
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:03,200
centimeters

59
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,119
so we wanted to build a radio telescope

60
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,719
that can detect this very very faint

61
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:07,600
radiation and make it available to

62
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:09,598
everyone

63
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:11,359
to use online for free without any

64
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:12,560
registration advertisements or anything

65
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,840
like that

66
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:17,360
so we began uh planning some uh

67
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,879
we've begun with some simulations for

68
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,280
the antenna

69
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:22,079
this is a fit horn simulation uh using

70
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,800
electromagnetic

71
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,760
solvers this is a simulated radiation

72
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,920
pattern

73
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:30,000
and after that we decided to build the

74
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,359
the antenna and uh got it measured in

75
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,400
the lab this is the tool company

76
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:36,239
the telecommunication systems laboratory

77
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,080
of the department of digital systems at

78
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:40,319
the university of heroes

79
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,400
uh we got the graphs uh and everything

80
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:45,119
this is s11 of the monopole for

81
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,840
those familiar with rf systems and of

82
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,440
course we

83
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:51,680
we measured the entire feedhorn which

84
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:53,359
made it made the monopole a bit more

85
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:56,560
wideband

86
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:59,200
so let's look at some stats uh it's uh

87
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:01,680
it's got it's a parabolic antenna with a

88
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,480
diameter of 1.5 meters so it's a large

89
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,120
dish

90
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,079
it can operate from from 1300 to 700

91
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,599
megahertz so

92
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,280
if anyone doesn't want to observe the

93
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:11,679
hydrogen line uh he can

94
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,720
look at a different frequency uh the

95
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,800
half power wing width

96
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,720
this is like the field of view it's

97
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:20,000
about nine degrees

98
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:21,840
and uh most importantly uh it's got a

99
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,080
filtered lna very low noise amplifier

100
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:26,799
with a 0.5 db noise figure

101
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,920
and of course it's fully open source so

102
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:30,879
anyone uh

103
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,280
can take the code and uh build his own

104
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:32,959
uh

105
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,280
so this is what the telescope looks like

106
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:38,400
uh in its current form

107
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:40,480
and uh this is this is basically the

108
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,840
the data acquisition flow graph the

109
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,280
digital signal processing

110
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,879
it's based on polyphase filter bank

111
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,280
spectrometer uh

112
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:48,239
this is gnu radio um many of you know

113
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,440
this

114
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:51,680
and uh you can find the full

115
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:53,439
documentation here on uh i've

116
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,760
made a separate documentation just for

117
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:58,400
for this flow graph

118
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:59,040
so uh how does it work the signal enters

119
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,959
the fit horn

120
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:03,040
gets amplified filter and then amplified

121
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:05,280
this is a two stage low noise amplifier

122
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,159
and runs through a three meter low uh

123
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,720
low loss

124
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:10,079
a coaxial cable then runs through a

125
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,840
furrowed cage to reduce

126
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,840
spurious emissions to the telescope

127
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,560
which is undesired runs through biased

128
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,760
and sdr

129
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,760
and of course raspberry pi

130
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:22,000
so let's uh why don't we make an

131
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:24,639
observation

132
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,639
so to make an observation a user simply

133
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:32,560
uh

134
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:34,639
simply goes to pictortelescope.com

135
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,000
and you can scroll down i've got the

136
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:39,120
github here and everything

137
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,440
check some information out and i've also

138
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,520
written a pdf in english you can take a

139
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:46,800
look at that it has some introductory uh

140
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:48,400
radio storm information uh so

141
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,560
maybe that's uh something you're

142
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,599
interested in for beginner users for

143
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,880
example

144
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:56,160
so we have here uh some a form it tells

145
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:59,040
you where the telescope is

146
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:01,360
uh pointing to uh right now it's in the

147
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,680
knees so direct lever head

148
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,520
so it allows us to uh for example uh put

149
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:08,400
an observation name like uh

150
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:09,120
like forces an example uh center

151
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,479
frequency

152
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,039
we want to do we want to observe the

153
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:16,240
hydrogen line so 420 megahertz

154
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:19,360
sounds reasonable uh bandwidth you can

155
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:22,639
go up to 3.2 uh megahertz but

156
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:24,080
2.4 is usually sufficient

157
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:25,720
then we have the number of channels this

158
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:28,960
is the fft size uh

159
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:31,039
2048 is usually fine

160
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,400
it's more than enough uh and you have

161
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:34,400
the number of bin which basically

162
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,440
determines the integration time per fft

163
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,400
sample

164
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:39,840
uh this won't really affect your signal

165
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,159
to noise ratio it's usually for uh

166
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:45,280
interference mitigation

167
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,160
and other kinds of things so duration

168
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:49,599
let's just put

169
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:53,840
20 seconds and uh input

170
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,840
our email address

171
00:05:54,240 --> 00:06:03,680
so if we hit helps okay

172
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:03,680
let's run this again so we said falsdam

173
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:09,359
okay 20 second duration and our email

174
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,359
address

175
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:18,880
okay all right let's uh

176
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:20,400
hit enter okay so now the observation is

177
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:23,280
running and the telescope

178
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,919
just picks up this uh this observation

179
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:28,559
let's actually

180
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:28,560
look into this in more detail

181
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:36,479
so what happens is uh the user uh loads

182
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,638
the observation page

183
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:40,000
checks the server checks if the if there

184
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:42,000
is an observation running and

185
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,039
if not it permits the user to submit an

186
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,440
observation with his

187
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:47,199
desired parameters so then the telescope

188
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:49,360
awaits the observation request

189
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:50,400
checks if if it has already been run and

190
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,639
if not then

191
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,638
it runs the observation does uh some

192
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:57,680
digital signal processing

193
00:06:54,639 --> 00:07:01,280
including rfi mitigation etc

194
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:02,080
and then sends the the data to the

195
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,559
observer via

196
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,680
email so the user the user can just go

197
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,639
into his email

198
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:10,240
and check the observation data so i

199
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:13,360
think we should have received

200
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,360
the observation now

201
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:20,800
let's give it a second usually takes

202
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:23,199
maybe a minute or two for the email to

203
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,199
arrive

204
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:32,479
okay there we go

205
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,919
so we have here the the observation uh

206
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:35,840
parameters that we entered

207
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:37,440
uh bandwidth sample rate number of

208
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,919
channels and everything

209
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:41,680
and over here we have the the graphs so

210
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:44,000
the telescope data

211
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,520
so we have four graphs in total this is

212
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,960
the average spectrum this is a

213
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:50,159
calibrated spectrum

214
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:52,560
so this is what the sdr receives and you

215
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:55,680
can see it's a very faint peak there

216
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:57,599
but you'll see some three humps so

217
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,680
this this is called the bandpass shape

218
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:02,878
and it's due to the it's like an sdr

219
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:04,479
artifact so if we calibrate that

220
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:06,720
it becomes flat and we can see the

221
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:10,240
hydrogen line a lot more clearer

222
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:12,879
so uh what would we see here in this uh

223
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,240
in this pic this is the hydrogen line

224
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:16,800
this corresponds to

225
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,919
a unique spiral arm in our galaxy

226
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,960
specifically this is the

227
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:21,599
the cygnus arm so our house spiral arm

228
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:24,840
of the

229
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:26,080
of a solar system and we have two more

230
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,840
graphs uh

231
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,680
the waterfall which basically shows you

232
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,359
the the entire data

233
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:33,839
it's just not very easy to see hence why

234
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:37,680
you have some some more graphs

235
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:37,680
and of course power versus time

236
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:43,039
okay so if we go back to the

237
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,039
presentation

238
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,839
okay so this is another example

239
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,640
observation taken at an even

240
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:54,480
even better time you can see three uh

241
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:57,120
three peaks here

242
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,839
so each each of those peaks corresponds

243
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,720
to a different

244
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:02,720
uh spiral arm in our galaxy so with just

245
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:05,680
uh an observation which this you can get

246
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:07,680
such data in like 60 seconds for example

247
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:09,760
you have proven you have detected three

248
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,599
unique spiral arms of the galaxy so

249
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:14,000
you've proven that the milky way

250
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:16,000
is indeed like we do in italy we do

251
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
indeed live in a spiral galaxy

252
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,320
which is not very easy to prove uh using

253
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,959
optical measurements

254
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,640
so let's look at uh let's look at some

255
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:27,760
statistics

256
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:31,199
so uh picture has been used uh

257
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:34,160
from 360 plus unique users

258
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:36,959
from all around the world uh we have uh

259
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:40,640
2.3 000 observations on the archive

260
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:42,319
uh imagine our goal was to hit a hundred

261
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:44,560
unique users in a year

262
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:46,800
and in less than a year in just a few

263
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,000
months we reached so many users which is

264
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:50,479
great

265
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,120
uh and these users include students

266
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54,480
teachers

267
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:57,839
uh educators professors amateurs and

268
00:09:54,480 --> 00:10:00,880
even professional astronomers

269
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:02,399
uh so some future plans uh

270
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:04,399
we have a lot of plans for for the

271
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:06,079
future regarding radio astronomy

272
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:08,720
uh one of them is the development of a

273
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:11,760
similar educational instrument

274
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:13,279
for uh for pulsar education and maybe be

275
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:15,760
part of research

276
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,480
as part of the pulsar monitoring network

277
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:19,680
which will be

278
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:22,959
dedicated for uh for glitch research uh

279
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:25,359
ultra glitch is basically uh an

280
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:27,040
open issue in uh northern problem in

281
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:30,399
science because

282
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:33,519
uh what what it means is the pulsar

283
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:34,079
upholstery is a neutron star uh it

284
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:37,600
presents

285
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:38,479
a sudden sudden uh decrease a sudden

286
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,440
change in the

287
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:44,240
in the in the spin period so we're

288
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:46,800
looking to uh research more into that

289
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,279
and of course we have lyra net which is

290
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,279
uh

291
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:51,040
which will be a global network of open

292
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:54,160
source radio telescopes

293
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:55,839
uh these include uh some small and large

294
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:58,160
dishes the largest one right now is

295
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:59,040
18 meters in diameters it's a huge huge

296
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:02,319
dish

297
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:04,719
and we have some many many more

298
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:07,200
and this this network will be for our

299
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:10,560
research and education as well

300
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:13,760
so we have plenty of plans for that

301
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:15,680
and last but not least

302
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,880
we'd like to thank liberspace foundation

303
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:19,040
for their support and

304
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:20,079
uh the support with the stickers and

305
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,240
also helping us

306
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:23,680
build another antenna that all with that

307
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:29,839
will also be part of

308
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:29,839
laronnet so uh yeah thank you very much

309
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,959
and of course feel free to take any

310
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:39,360
stickers you want uh

311
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:43,839
from over there and i'll be happy to

312
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,839
take some questions

313
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:50,719
okay so the question is uh what's the

314
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:54,000
cost of designing the such telescope

315
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,880
yes so uh it depends on the diameter of

316
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,800
course and

317
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,920
what backhand you will use and what rf

318
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,479
frontend so

319
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:02,479
maybe you you want to go with uh some

320
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,519
even lower noise amplifiers some better

321
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,720
filters

322
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:09,040
um a larger dish uh

323
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,160
you know maybe you want to make it more

324
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:13,120
wideband

325
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:15,040
uh so there's a lot of options uh you

326
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,920
can design a telescope like picture for

327
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:18,880
uh

328
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:19,599
uh you know uh a few hundred bucks maybe

329
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,760
less

330
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,639
uh we just designed a new one called

331
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,880
nanort

332
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:25,920
nanoradio telescope which looks like an

333
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:29,120
optical telescope

334
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:31,760
it's very very small um

335
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,639
this this costed under a hundred so

336
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:36,160
there's a lot of

337
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:38,240
possibilities and if anyone wants to uh

338
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,920
to build a radio telescope they can

339
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,600
really do this i mean i've written

340
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:45,040
all the software for you so you don't

341
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,040
have to go through this work as well

342
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:53,839
any more questions yes

343
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,120
uh so the telescope basically uh points

344
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:03,040
uh constantly to the neath

345
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:05,200
so you can use uh students can use

346
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:06,800
something like uh like a planetarium

347
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,480
virtual planter software like a

348
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:10,079
stellarium to uh

349
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:13,120
to see where the telescope is pointing

350
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:13,120
to so

351
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:16,959
the the elevation sometimes changes for

352
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:20,000
example

353
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:21,680
on requests like uh if a student

354
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,360
wishes to observe the moon or the sun

355
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:25,599
for example then they tell us

356
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,959
uh can you can you please shift it to a

357
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:30,399
certain elevation

358
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:32,079
and uh they they often perform a drift

359
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:33,920
kind of observation so

360
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:35,199
uh they don't have in the case of the

361
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:37,120
moon and the sun you don't have to

362
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,320
observe at 14 20 megahertz because

363
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,279
you're not looking to observe the

364
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,639
hydrogen line

365
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:43,680
you're looking to observe something uh

366
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:46,800
much closer uh so in the case of uh

367
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:48,479
of a sun or a lunar lunar drift kind of

368
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:51,439
observation you you what you're looking

369
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:53,360
for is the um power versus time

370
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,560
in this case you you should see the

371
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:58,000
power being

372
00:13:54,560 --> 00:14:00,719
mostly flat and slowly rising uh

373
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,600
forming a gaussian curve and then you

374
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,600
know uh going

375
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:06,399
straight like so you basically see a

376
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:08,399
peak when the uh

377
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:09,440
when the sun or moon enters your your

378
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:12,320
field of view of the beam

379
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,320
of the telescope

380
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:17,839
any any more questions

381
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:31,839
okay thank you very much thank you

382
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:35,360
you
