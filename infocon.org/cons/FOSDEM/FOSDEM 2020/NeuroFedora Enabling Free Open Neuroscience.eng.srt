1
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:08,320
okay so

2
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:09,920
hello everyone um i'm aniket pradhan am

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,320
i audible over there

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:14,240
it's fine yeah cool so i'm aniket

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:18,080
pradhan and today i'll be talking about

6
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:20,800
nero fedora and how we can

7
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:22,799
use i mean like about neuro fedora what

8
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,000
it is and what's the aim and motive

9
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,400
behind it and

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,240
what's what's the purpose of like

11
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,799
actually having a neuro fedora

12
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:33,440
thing over here so i guess like everyone

13
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:36,000
would be aware of fedora what fedora is

14
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:38,239
so fedora is just another another

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,440
operating system based on linux

16
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:45,199
just like debian or ubuntu

17
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:46,800
so nero fedora is a group that's main

18
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,480
purpose is to provide new

19
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,839
neuroscience packages neuroscience

20
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:53,199
software

21
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,800
in fedora so before we dig into

22
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:56,320
dig deeper into nato fedora let's just

23
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,078
start about like

24
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,440
how do we do our research in

25
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,239
neuroscience in the neuroscience

26
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:04,479
community

27
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:06,479
so the research pipeline basically

28
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:08,159
so i mean as you can see in the diagram

29
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:08,960
it's actually a simplified diagram but

30
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,520
it's

31
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,960
actually quite complex process so i mean

32
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,840
it's the general

33
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,559
overflow i mean like we go from uh data

34
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,680
analysis

35
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:24,400
to uh theory and then we have like

36
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:26,240
uh modeling our neurosci our near

37
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,240
any neuroscience structure and then we

38
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,720
have our experiments and stuff

39
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,360
like more most of these works nowadays

40
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,720
are being

41
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,720
conducted through the use of computer

42
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:37,920
software and computer tools

43
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,880
so like there are many there are many

44
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,520
tools

45
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:43,839
like for experimental we have like eeg

46
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,439
monitoring and stuff and like we have ct

47
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,399
machines we have mri

48
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:49,919
for data analysis we have statistical uh

49
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:52,240
machine learning libraries

50
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,880
and data analysis like numpy cipher i

51
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:57,839
mean like python libraries i mean

52
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,399
and then we have theory and uh modeling

53
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,119
uh

54
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:02,640
softwares there are there are all kinds

55
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:05,200
of simulators

56
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,240
so i mean like there's a list of like

57
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,560
all kinds of

58
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,959
all kinds of tools and software that you

59
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:13,599
we use to like uh produce and reproduce

60
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:14,160
information in the uh research domain

61
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:16,319
that's

62
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,599
like we need softwares for visualization

63
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:21,599
academic writing like

64
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:22,000
logic and um i don't know any other sort

65
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:24,399
of

66
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,680
logic but yeah we have non-academic

67
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,800
writing like blogging

68
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,319
and uh yeah we do we use software for

69
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:34,080
podcasting and stuff and

70
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:36,720
so on so forth okay so uh

71
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,120
what do we mean by free and open signs

72
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,359
okay

73
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,519
so i mean like free and open like

74
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:44,560
everyone should be able to

75
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:46,400
like have the freedom to share read or

76
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,840
make amendments and modify to your

77
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,760
scientific material

78
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,680
right like that's the definition of

79
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:54,079
first everyone should have access the

80
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:56,000
should have freedom to access and study

81
00:02:54,080 --> 00:03:00,400
what you are actually working on

82
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:04,640
right so okay let's move on forward

83
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:08,000
so over here it's about it's uh

84
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:09,440
it's a paper uh by p gleeson uh about

85
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,519
a commitment to open science and

86
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:14,159
neuroscience it's basically its main

87
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:16,319
motive is to solve the reproducibility

88
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:18,079
crisis that we have like we are unable

89
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:19,679
to reproduce the data or

90
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,959
the results i mean like that's very

91
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,080
important if you are publishing some

92
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:25,680
papers or

93
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:27,840
your results on on to the public

94
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,440
so like what can be the benefits of

95
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,360
having open source codes

96
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:33,920
i mean like it can first of all solve

97
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,760
the reproducibility crisis

98
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,280
like people can reuse that code and then

99
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,840
build upon their new

100
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,680
tools and software on it and the

101
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,120
publication or the code becomes an

102
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,560
adword for each other

103
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,920
i mean like you go to a publication

104
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,440
people will look at your code you go to

105
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,640
the code people look at your publication

106
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:51,200
and then

107
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:52,958
you can go on forth with developing new

108
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:56,560
stuff

109
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:59,439
so neuro fedora why so i mean like

110
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,799
the neuroscience community is full of i

111
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:02,480
mean the scientific community is full of

112
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:03,680
people from different domains i mean not

113
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:06,959
everyone over here

114
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:09,200
is a software developer right i mean

115
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,560
that most of most people are biologists

116
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,720
or some

117
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,319
data analysts or some not everyone is a

118
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,560
software developer

119
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:17,599
not everyone has the required experience

120
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,000
right so

121
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,799
only a small proportion of the

122
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,840
scientists

123
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:27,039
or the actual people working on research

124
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:28,000
are trained software developers so they

125
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,040
work on the software

126
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,560
and they create uh they create uh

127
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,400
they are basically developers of the

128
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,160
software too they create us

129
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,758
they create a tool that can be used for

130
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,160
by the end users

131
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:41,840
but the main problem here is that the

132
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,199
developer may not provide like proper

133
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,799
instruction on

134
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:46,560
how to use the tool i mean he may not

135
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,880
provide documentation

136
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,560
and there are some people the end user

137
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,560
and like

138
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,400
the the end users they're not not

139
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,759
necessarily they are not necessarily

140
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,400
trained software developers

141
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:59,440
so they might not have the required

142
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,440
knowledge

143
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,479
they may not have the required knowledge

144
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,080
or the

145
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:05,520
experience to build and use the tool

146
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,840
directly

147
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:09,280
and over here the end users may not

148
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,359
always provide the feedback

149
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,880
on how good the tool is if it's working

150
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:16,320
correctly or not

151
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:18,400
so if you are a developer i mean a

152
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:21,199
neuroscience a tool developer

153
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,000
then like we often face many of such

154
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:23,440
problems like

155
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,520
there's often a single developer a

156
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,199
single professor a single professor

157
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,719
who's working on a single

158
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:30,479
uh or a small team who's working on a

159
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:33,759
single uh development tool

160
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:35,360
so and like given how interdisciplinary

161
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:37,280
in the neuroscience community is

162
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:39,039
most researchers are not entrained and

163
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:41,520
development so

164
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:43,840
i mean like we have limited maintenance

165
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,520
or short lived projects because once a

166
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,880
research event started research work is

167
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:49,280
done like

168
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:51,199
people no longer contribute to it and

169
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,799
they have limited access to hardware

170
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:55,520
limited code quality

171
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,880
and like based on all these uh evidences

172
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,799
like software using

173
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,800
research is not always of the best

174
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,840
quality may not always be of the best

175
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,919
quality

176
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:06,239
so i mean like it may or may not mean

177
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:08,240
the development standards that

178
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,319
people in the programming domain have

179
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,080
like the proper developers

180
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:14,720
who are trained in software programming

181
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:17,359
and all so

182
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:19,199
and they have complex dependency chains

183
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,520
there can be some dependency loops as

184
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,479
well

185
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:24,400
but like how can how can a developer

186
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:26,400
solve that so

187
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:28,159
that's the problem in the software in

188
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:31,520
the research domain right now

189
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:33,120
but for the end users like uh

190
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,560
many of the end users they waste time

191
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:37,280
and effort to install

192
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,960
your the when whenever they waste time

193
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,799
in installing a particular tool

194
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,479
they have to go through the particular

195
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,960
tools dependencies and then resolve the

196
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:47,919
dependencies first and then get the tool

197
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,799
right they lack the required skill of

198
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:51,120
programming

199
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,720
usually i mean like not always but yeah

200
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,120
they have a hard time setting up and

201
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,560
using the software they rarely send bug

202
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,479
reports upstream

203
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,240
and they do not check for tests i mean

204
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:02,080
like they do not run the test with

205
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,680
so how do they ensure the correctness of

206
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,758
the working program i mean

207
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,520
uh testing the correctness of a program

208
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,639
is very important in the res in the

209
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:11,680
research domain and that

210
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:15,520
academic domain that's to ensure your

211
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:18,560
uh your final papers correctness

212
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:20,639
and many of the end users are unaware of

213
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:24,240
the help for developmental tools

214
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:25,199
like many of many many end users do not

215
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,240
know that there

216
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:30,240
exists a library to analyze your

217
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,880
dicom files and everything but instead

218
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:35,199
they do it manually so

219
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,919
that's what that's where neuro fedora or

220
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:38,160
this red

221
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:39,440
distributions come in so what basically

222
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,800
distributions do

223
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,120
is that they take the code from the

224
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,319
developer and then they package it in a

225
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:47,919
neat and nice way

226
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:50,319
and then provided it to the end user so

227
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:51,280
the distributions like fedora or debian

228
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:53,199
they act as

229
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:55,359
a liaison between the user and the

230
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:58,400
developers they provide

231
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,520
the feedback and report bugs to the

232
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,878
developer as well

233
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:06,080
and it basically simplifies in

234
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:08,560
your installation and your usage of

235
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:10,000
any software tool that is being packaged

236
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,319
so i mean like

237
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,160
distribution selected where they have a

238
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:15,759
good advantage at being over here

239
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,160
they have high-end servers they have

240
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:19,280
like multiples multiple mirrors running

241
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,479
across the globe

242
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,719
and they have you have the

243
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:24,159
infrastructure and they're like firm

244
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,560
packaging guidelines

245
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,919
follow the best practices we always run

246
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,520
the test suits and we

247
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:31,599
before a tool this package it goes

248
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,598
through a heavy-duty review process

249
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:34,958
so i mean like the tool is properly

250
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:38,080
tested and then

251
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:40,239
it is provided to the end users

252
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,680
and we constantly work on community

253
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,159
development we learn from

254
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:45,519
one another and we are we always provide

255
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:48,560
help to the users

256
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:52,000
so that's where we come in

257
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:54,479
so neuro fedora what it is it's

258
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,800
a group of people who are aiming to

259
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:59,600
package your neuroscience tools

260
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,560
and software for the fedora operating

261
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,640
system

262
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,959
so our primary goal is to provide a

263
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:07,439
ready-to-use integrated force

264
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:08,239
platform for neuroscientists right so we

265
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,519
aim to create

266
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:13,760
a spin or a lab image of your fedora

267
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:14,959
and provide it to the users in fact we

268
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:17,439
have created one

269
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:18,800
and we will i will share it to you in

270
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,760
the next few slides

271
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:23,199
and our secondary and the secondary

272
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:25,120
goals is to provide

273
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,560
improve the standards of packaging and

274
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,880
maintaining the tools

275
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:31,119
help users develop help users develop

276
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:33,360
the software development skills

277
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,760
that are required for when you are

278
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:37,680
creating a tool or when you are using it

279
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:39,399
and

280
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,040
make neuroscience accessible to

281
00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:43,920
non-specialists

282
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:45,839
right so our neurofed with our current

283
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:47,839
metrics we just turned a year old in

284
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:50,880
september 2019

285
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:54,399
we have like 20 volunteers 16 packages

286
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:55,920
and only five who has from a

287
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:57,920
neuroscience background

288
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:00,079
so most of us are just acting as

289
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:01,680
packages while those five are actually

290
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:05,040
guiding us on how to

291
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:06,880
package and how to review stuff

292
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:09,519
we have five designers and newcomers as

293
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,519
well so

294
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:17,680
sorry so

295
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:19,760
about software we have like 135 tools we

296
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:21,920
have packaged for fedora right now

297
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:24,480
uh we have like the neuron simulator the

298
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:27,599
nest simulator genesis brian moves

299
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:30,240
and we are uh we have like multiple

300
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:32,560
uh packages in queue as well we have

301
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:36,720
around like 180 packages in queue

302
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:36,719
like or something sorry

303
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,760
sorry yeah so we have like 180 packages

304
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:48,560
in queue

305
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:49,360
that are being that are in process of

306
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:52,640
being packaged

307
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:56,720
and stuff so we have near mlight and

308
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:58,640
simulators of that kind as well so

309
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,760
i guess that's it this is the current

310
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:02,079
slide i mean

311
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,680
you can search us on google and you can

312
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:05,279
search we have a mailing list over here

313
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:07,040
as well we have an irc channel a

314
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:08,959
telegram channel as well

315
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:11,760
our documentation is present at neuro

316
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:15,119
dot fedoraproject.org

317
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,680
we have a blog as well please do have a

318
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:29,519
look at

319
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:32,800
it that's it for me so um any questions

320
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:35,120
uh people may have regarding neurofedora

321
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,120
over here

322
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,839
yes

323
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,320
is going please trying to upstream as

324
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:45,839
many of those packages into the main

325
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:57,839
fedora repository

326
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:57,839
can you please read the question um

327
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:02,800
uh i mean like uh all the packages that

328
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:06,000
we are creating right now

329
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:08,000
okay so okay yeah so uh

330
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,079
the question is uh if we are creating a

331
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,240
separate uh repository for fedora

332
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:13,599
uh this upstream is separate from the

333
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,360
federal repository right

334
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,440
so uh the upstream is separate from our

335
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,240
federal repository i mean we create we

336
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,360
are creating our

337
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,800
and we are creating our own uh packages

338
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,880
and they are getting stored in the

339
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,839
fedora servers the upstream is separate

340
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:29,120
from it we just

341
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:32,079
take the release turbo or the release

342
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:33,200
zip from the upstream and then use it as

343
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:35,519
our

344
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,959
uh source code and then we package it in

345
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:39,360
a lightweight nice way and then we

346
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:43,439
provide it to the end users

347
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:46,560
so it's all separate right

348
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:49,600
please as a follow-up question um how

349
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:52,638
would you describe the help or

350
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:55,279
the how does the fedora team core

351
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:57,519
welcomes like packaging coming from the

352
00:12:55,279 --> 00:13:01,040
scientific background

353
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:03,920
uh coming from the scientific world yeah

354
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:06,160
so uh his question is uh what does the

355
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,839
fedora core team think of

356
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:10,000
the packages coming from the scientific

357
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:12,880
world so

358
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,600
um i don't have any views of that what

359
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,680
the core team

360
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,040
thinks of the fedora core teams thing

361
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:20,719
but we as a group

362
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:24,319
think that each and every like

363
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:26,480
uh software can like can be up from many

364
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:28,639
any domain like either be it scientific

365
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,639
or

366
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:35,120
video or multimedia so

367
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:36,880
that's our perspective that uh we want

368
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,839
neuroscience packages in fedora so we

369
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,920
formed a group

370
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:41,440
we want like neuroscience packages and

371
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,319
the fedora the community is very

372
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,639
welcoming the co

373
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:46,880
the core team they actually support us

374
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:46,880
