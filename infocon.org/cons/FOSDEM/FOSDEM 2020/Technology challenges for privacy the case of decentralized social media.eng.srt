1
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,599
we still have two minutes

2
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,040
uh however i think we can just start and

3
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:39,200
i will start with all these guys

4
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,079
if it's okay i'll work without slides

5
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,480
for the first

6
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,399
few minutes well i will just need the

7
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,959
computer basically to look at the slides

8
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,960
myself

9
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,719
so my computer will not be available

10
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,960
anywhere that's the only

11
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:53,360
thing so if you can put it on another

12
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,360
computer

13
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:58,160
i will just take this off okay and start

14
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:00,399
to present

15
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,919
with my laptop and uh without the slides

16
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:03,760
on the screen for the audience but i

17
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,879
will explain basically the content on

18
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,920
the slides or however

19
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:07,600
it's just going to be a speech you'll

20
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,880
use your slides to help you remember

21
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:12,789
exactly

22
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:15,869
exactly that we really need a slide

23
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:15,869
[Music]

24
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,240
so i apologize we're having a little bit

25
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:37,840
of technical difficulty with christina's

26
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,520
slides but hopefully we'll get that

27
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,040
fixed shortly but she's going to go

28
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,839
ahead and get started so thank you

29
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:46,479
christina

30
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,479
yes so hello everyone uh

31
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:52,798
and uh in my defense i do have slides

32
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,640
but they are here so i will use them for

33
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:58,880
the purpose of this presentation

34
00:01:54,640 --> 00:02:01,040
uh so my um my my challenge would be

35
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:04,719
basically to attract the attention here

36
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,719
and not on the screen um

37
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,520
okay and i am however very excited to be

38
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,680
here

39
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,440
and to present you some aspects

40
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,000
regarding technology challenges for

41
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,680
privacy the case of decentralized social

42
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,239
media

43
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,520
uh first of all a small disclaimer this

44
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:24,000
talk is not

45
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,959
a legal advice it is meant to be taken

46
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,800
generic

47
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:28,720
and it's not to be applied to a certain

48
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,560
particular situation if you're searching

49
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,640
for legal advice i strongly encourage

50
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,400
you to go and seek it

51
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,238
and also it's meant to be a bridge

52
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,560
between technical aspects

53
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:41,040
and the legal community and this means

54
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,720
that it's sort of sacrificing a bit of a

55
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:45,440
legal and technical procedure

56
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,239
in order for it to be more uh more

57
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,000
adjusted

58
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:49,360
for both the communities the legal

59
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,080
community and also the technical

60
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,920
community

61
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,879
i'm sorry you need to put output to the

62
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,799
hdmi

63
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:58,319
because there is no output from your

64
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,680
left over there okay

65
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:03,920
no letter glitter speaking yeah

66
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,920
okay

67
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,720
yes no it's okay

68
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:17,120
um okay so to continue uh

69
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:19,519
some um some legislation i think you've

70
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,280
everybody heard about the gdpr it's very

71
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:22,000
it's very we are very aware of its

72
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,519
existence

73
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,760
uh is meant to protect personal data

74
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:30,400
and personal data means in the sense of

75
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:32,399
the gdpr personal identifiable data

76
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,080
and that means basically any data that

77
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,040
can be used to identify

78
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:39,519
an individual alone or corroborated with

79
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:41,280
another type of data

80
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:43,680
and here i would like to mention for

81
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,799
example name email address phone number

82
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,920
but also ip

83
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:51,519
address and login ids images

84
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:54,559
social media posts and so on um

85
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:58,319
then on my slide i have a few

86
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:59,680
i have a few statistics regarding the

87
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:01,920
fact that the

88
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:04,000
main social media platforms have

89
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,798
increased their number of users and we

90
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,560
are talking about

91
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:08,560
billions of people that are currently

92
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,959
using social media

93
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,879
uh and on the other side we have

94
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:16,160
decentralized social media

95
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:17,120
which for example musta done where we

96
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,560
have also

97
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,560
a certain number of people so it

98
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,479
attracts attention and

99
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,160
also significant number of toots which

100
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:27,599
is in fact more than

101
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:30,320
one quadrillion 562 trillion and so on

102
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,840
so we have a lot of personal data that

103
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,440
is out there and that is being given

104
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:36,719
away willingly by us

105
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:37,440
consensual uh and here we find ourselves

106
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,639
in our

107
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:42,479
in our society basically in a situation

108
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:44,400
of being in a privacy paradox because

109
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:48,400
ourselves we are giving away

110
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:49,039
uh consensual our uh private data but on

111
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,599
the other

112
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,880
from from the other point of view uh we

113
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,199
are

114
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:57,360
we are seeing ourselves uh basically in

115
00:04:55,199 --> 00:05:00,000
a situation of

116
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,000
of um

117
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,479
of how to say how to explain uh give

118
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:06,639
away our data willingly

119
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:08,159
but on the other side we find a lot of

120
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,280
awareness campaigns and a lot of

121
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,199
situations

122
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,880
where we hear from everywhere that

123
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:15,280
privacy is important we should

124
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,560
care about our privacy and so on but on

125
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:19,119
the other side

126
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,320
we are giving away our data and this

127
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,039
creates a situation

128
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:24,639
of maybe a black bloc society it has

129
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:25,840
been said that we are living in a black

130
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:27,919
box society

131
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,198
where hidden algorithms can make

132
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:31,359
allowing reputation

133
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:39,759
decide the destiny of entrepreneurs or

134
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:43,600
even devastate an entire economy

135
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:46,880
just one second is everything okay okay

136
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,759
so uh we have uh uh some privacy design

137
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,800
strategies

138
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:52,720
uh and this uh this need for

139
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,639
privacy by design the principle of

140
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,240
privacy by design from the gdpr

141
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:57,840
becomes more stringent in such a

142
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,919
situation because it eliminates the

143
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,119
aspect of us consenting to give away our

144
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:02,880
private data

145
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,880
and it it's it's basically very

146
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:08,560
important to have people

147
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:12,479
uh to have to have the people uh that

148
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:14,000
are that are taking uh

149
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:16,318
into consideration the principle of

150
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,960
privacy by design and incorporate

151
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:19,360
privacy

152
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,560
requirements into account right from the

153
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,800
start and throughout

154
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,560
the system development life cycle and

155
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,160
this means according to this philosophy

156
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,680
of privacy by design the fact that

157
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,759
privacy should be regarded as an

158
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:33,120
intrinsic software attribute

159
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:34,080
and we can identify eight main privacy

160
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,400
strategy privacy

161
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:38,240
design strategy existent we have

162
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,080
basically uh we should look at them

163
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,840
basically as an ideal concept because

164
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,639
the point is to aim to reach some of

165
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,280
them

166
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:47,039
and also neither of them in itself is

167
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:49,840
ensuring compliance with privacy by

168
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,840
design

169
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,560
now regarding these privacy design

170
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,560
strategies

171
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,800
they are split into two main categories

172
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,400
based on based on how what they tackle

173
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,240
on one side they are tackled data

174
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,919
oriented aspects and on the other side

175
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,960
we are talking about processes

176
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:09,280
inside an organization now the first one

177
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,880
is minimize i will not actually go and

178
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,799
discuss about each of them very in

179
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,520
detail i will focus just on one which is

180
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,520
separate

181
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,960
but just to give you a glimpse of it the

182
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,719
first one is minimize which means

183
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,638
basically that the amount of personal

184
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:23,039
data that is processed should be

185
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:25,919
restricted to a minimal amount possible

186
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:26,719
and as main tactics recommended we have

187
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:28,318
select

188
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,840
which means that we should select the

189
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,280
relevant people and the relevant

190
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:33,039
attributes exclude

191
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,719
which means basically that we should

192
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:35,759
exclude people or attributes from the

193
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,759
beginning

194
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:39,919
uh remove data and also destroy it

195
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:42,319
permanently

196
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:44,318
uh the second one is height and height

197
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:46,720
means that any personal information

198
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:48,720
should be hidden from plain view for

199
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,720
example in a situation of mixed networks

200
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,639
to hide patterns or in a situation where

201
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,440
there is a request for the right to be

202
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:55,680
forgotten

203
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:57,680
uh the data to be deleted but it's not

204
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:00,319
really deleted it's still kept on

205
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:02,400
on our databases in that situation that

206
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:03,919
data still exists and should be made

207
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,520
unlinkable and should be made

208
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:07,758
unrelatable basically

209
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,878
and the main tactics in this principle

210
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:11,599
uh is uh

211
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:12,080
dissociating crypt and uh restrict

212
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:15,840
access

213
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:17,280
to uh personal information

214
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,039
everything's great you're doing great

215
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:22,559
okay thank you very much

216
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:23,599
uh then uh from the point of view of

217
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,840
abstract

218
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:27,680
uh you should limit the details in which

219
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:29,919
personal data is processed

220
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,280
which means that personal data should be

221
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:33,199
processed at the highest level of

222
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:35,439
aggregation and with the latest level of

223
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:38,399
detail necessary for the purposes of

224
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:40,080
of the processing and as main tactics

225
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:42,159
they are

226
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,919
they are basically uh recommending to

227
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:46,080
summarize details into

228
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:48,480
a more general attribute and also to

229
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,560
group basically to abstract information

230
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,160
at the level of a group of people uh

231
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,959
instead of processing it at the level of

232
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:56,800
a single person

233
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:58,479
another one which is more related to

234
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:01,519
processes is inform

235
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:03,600
which means that data subjects

236
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:05,519
they should be informed about the

237
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,800
processing of their personal data in a

238
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:08,640
timely and

239
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,560
plain language manner and as main

240
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,399
tactics we have supply

241
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:14,079
make information available basically we

242
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:16,399
have notify for example

243
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:18,320
notify about the breach occurring uh we

244
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:19,360
have explained in a concise and plain

245
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,519
language manner

246
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,720
and also we have another strategy which

247
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:25,040
is control

248
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,800
uh which means that we should provide

249
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:29,360
the means necessary in order

250
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,079
to tackle the consent of the of the

251
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,880
person

252
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,760
and as main tactics we have asked for

253
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,279
consent

254
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,519
that means that the consent should be

255
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:39,839
explicit freely given in

256
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:41,839
offered in an informed manner uh we

257
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:44,240
should give the user a real choice

258
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:44,880
uh we should offer means to review and

259
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,279
update

260
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,920
personal information and we should also

261
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:51,839
retract

262
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,839
offer the possibility to retract consent

263
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:56,239
and another to uh enforce and

264
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,399
demonstrate

265
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:00,480
uh the aspect of enforcement we should

266
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:01,600
establish privacy policies inside our

267
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,920
organizations

268
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,519
and as main tactics we have create

269
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,160
maintain and update these privacy

270
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:08,160
policies

271
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:10,480
and also demonstrate which means

272
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:12,480
basically that we should be taken

273
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,480
accountable to proof compliance with

274
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,839
privacy regulations as the main tactics

275
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:19,519
the recommendation would be

276
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:22,800
to audit to record to report to private

277
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:25,839
to privacy authorities

278
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:28,479
and then we have finally separate

279
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:30,720
the separate aspect means that as a best

280
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,800
practice we should distribute or isolate

281
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,560
any processing of personal data storage

282
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:37,040
collection operations perform

283
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:38,959
and as main tactics we have isolate and

284
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:41,519
isolation means that we should process

285
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:43,839
personal data in separate databases

286
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:46,000
or apps independently without access or

287
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:47,839
correlation between parts

288
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,519
and also a second one which is very

289
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:51,200
relevant for this for the stock is

290
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:53,120
distribute that means that we should

291
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,760
partition personal data

292
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,959
so that more access is required in order

293
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,319
to process it

294
00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:00,239
uh and we should distribute the

295
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,399
processing of personal data over

296
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:05,279
different physical locations

297
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:07,120
with no control from one single entity

298
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:11,040
and we should use the equipment

299
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:13,120
of the data subject himself and versus

300
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:15,120
as opposed to central components and

301
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,880
basically we should use decentralized

302
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:20,000
over centralized

303
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:21,760
as a best practice now if we think about

304
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,519
the current state the status quo

305
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:26,000
how social media looks like and if we

306
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:27,360
think about the ideal social network

307
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,160
from the perspective of these eight

308
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,160
principles

309
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:31,279
we see that there's a long way to go so

310
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,120
basically there are a lot

311
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:35,200
there's a lot of room for improve for

312
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,720
improvement however the point being is

313
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,800
that if there is such a

314
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,720
ideal social network the social network

315
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,479
would be decentralized

316
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,920
and user will store basically their

317
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,839
personal information on their own

318
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,640
devices and share them in a peer-to-peer

319
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:48,720
fashion

320
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:50,800
a decentralized system basically if we

321
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,399
go more deep into the matter we discover

322
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:54,560
that it's not just peer-to-peer

323
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:56,000
and it's a distributed system where

324
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:58,079
multiple authorities control

325
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:01,440
different components and there is

326
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:05,279
basically no single authority that

327
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:06,959
is fully trusted by others and we have a

328
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:08,800
large variety of designs

329
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:11,518
uh starting from the peer-to-peer

330
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:14,800
fashion and ad-hoc mesh and so on

331
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:16,560
until we go to for example more complex

332
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:19,359
structures which are federated super

333
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,359
node networks

334
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:27,439
regarding federated systems are the as

335
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,920
the characteristics of these

336
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:31,279
systems we have the provider nodes which

337
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:33,360
act as an authority

338
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:34,399
and they are being trusted basically by

339
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:37,120
other users

340
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:38,399
uh each provider is responsible for its

341
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:40,959
own users

342
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:44,240
between providers there is collaboration

343
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:44,239
in order to provide a service

344
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:50,639
there is no single provider that has

345
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,480
authority over the rest

346
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:54,639
the infrastructure is usually

347
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,959
independent and the providers act as a

348
00:12:54,639 --> 00:13:00,560
super node in terms of routing

349
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:02,560
and as a backside the provider itself

350
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,119
because the responsibility falls upon

351
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,040
himself

352
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,480
is actually the main target for attacks

353
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:08,560
related to security

354
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:10,560
and the provider has the potential to

355
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:15,119
violate the privacy of the nodes

356
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:15,119
based on design choices on the platform

357
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,760
as main benefits of decentralized social

358
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,760
media

359
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:23,760
we have the aspect of surveillance the

360
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,639
fact that it's more challenging to take

361
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,120
place

362
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:27,760
uh there is no entity in control so

363
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,079
obviously

364
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:31,040
it's it's easier uh to avoid such a

365
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:33,120
situation

366
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,880
because of the diversity location uh

367
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:37,680
this can overpass censorship

368
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,320
political censorship uh we are talking

369
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,479
about

370
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:42,320
because of this model about distributed

371
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,959
trust which means that the network can

372
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,920
be built

373
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:48,000
in such a way uh that part of the nodes

374
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:50,160
are trustworthy and in this context the

375
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,199
security of the network is preserved and

376
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:53,040
from this benefit

377
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:55,120
for example blockchains are taking

378
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:57,760
advantage a lot of this feature

379
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:59,360
we have integrity which means that the

380
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:02,480
model is more robust

381
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:04,800
versus an attack that is meant down that

382
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:07,760
is meant to take down the entire network

383
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:09,599
because of being decentralized uh from

384
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,319
the point of view of confidentiality the

385
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,959
framework

386
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,760
could act as a field uh for third

387
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:16,479
parties

388
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:18,160
and uh also uh from the point of view of

389
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,680
serenity from the user

390
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:21,360
the user is more in control of the

391
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:25,040
personal data

392
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:26,320
and uh it avoids the uneven balance of

393
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,639
power between

394
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:30,720
centralized operators and users because

395
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:31,839
in the end in a centralized network we

396
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,920
are seeing ourselves

397
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:35,360
in an uneven balance of power where we

398
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:37,519
have the operator

399
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:39,440
which sees everything on the platform

400
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:41,199
and we have the small user that uses

401
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,680
that platform but in the decentralized

402
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:43,519
model

403
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:46,079
this balance of power shifts and it's

404
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:46,079
more even

405
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:50,560
as challenges of decentralization we

406
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:53,760
have in fact

407
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:57,199
surprised the gdpr framework which is

408
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:58,720
pretty much meant to if you read the

409
00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:01,439
gdpr you will see

410
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,920
that it's more meant to uh to discuss

411
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,240
about

412
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,680
the centralized cloud-based internet so

413
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:08,079
it's more it more talks

414
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:10,638
uh for the situation of having a company

415
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:13,120
or an organization or an individual

416
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:13,839
and the relationship with their cloud

417
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,680
provider

418
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:17,279
it talks about a data controller and a

419
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,959
data processor it does not refer

420
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:21,040
directly to the situations when

421
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:22,638
when we have peer-to-peer networks so

422
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:25,439
this framework itself

423
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:27,760
is uh let's say uh not very clear from

424
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:30,560
the from the perspective of the law

425
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,680
and also we have difficulties applying

426
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,279
some aspects

427
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:35,040
the right to be forgotten for example

428
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:37,360
how do we apply it to blockchains

429
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,240
or how do we apply data minimization to

430
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:42,079
uh to

431
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:44,560
such big databases and on the other side

432
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:46,479
we can notice also some trade-offs that

433
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:49,680
are happening because in a situation of

434
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:52,839
centralization versus decentralization

435
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:54,479
in fact the trade-off is trust versus

436
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:56,480
transparency trust

437
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,600
in the central provider in the case of

438
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,600
centralization

439
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:01,199
and in the case of decentralization we

440
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,360
are giving away privacy

441
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:04,399
sorry transparency because the

442
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,160
interactions

443
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:08,399
are the interactions happening on the

444
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:10,399
network they are becoming more visible

445
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:13,120
on the network in order for the

446
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:18,240
decentralized system to exist

447
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:20,240
and uh there is no content transparency

448
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:22,320
but there is the protocol transparency

449
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:24,079
so by transparency i'm not talking about

450
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,839
uh the content itself because from the

451
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:26,560
point of view of the content we are more

452
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:28,639
pr

453
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:30,399
especially if we if we think about

454
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:33,040
encryption mechanisms we are more

455
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:34,880
okay the content that we post on social

456
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,599
media which is decentralized it's more

457
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,720
protected

458
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,040
but from the point of view of the

459
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:42,639
metadata uh

460
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:44,000
there are a radical of uh transparency

461
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:46,079
at the level of the protocol

462
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,680
or the metadata so this this is uh this

463
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:49,359
is problematic from this point of view

464
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,479
so when we talk about this trade-off of

465
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:54,639
transparency

466
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:56,800
we are referring more about uh about

467
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:59,040
not content transparency but more

468
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:00,719
protocol and metadata transparency

469
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:03,599
which needs to work to be working

470
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:05,839
somebody was telling me that

471
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:08,160
metadata is for a decentralized system

472
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:08,958
like the oil is for an engine to

473
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,880
function

474
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:12,640
so in order for it to function we do

475
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:16,400
need to have access to this and we do

476
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,400
need to build this trust between nodes

477
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:22,479
now uh a very interesting uh example

478
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:24,559
is the example of the photoverse uh

479
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:27,199
where uh

480
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:29,039
we can find present on the platform and

481
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:31,679
as actors present we have

482
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:33,440
users lots of data subjects we have

483
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:34,240
instance administrators they are the

484
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,840
ones that

485
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,840
maybe they are processors or the

486
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,959
controllers from the perspective of the

487
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:41,039
gdpr

488
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:43,520
uh or they are programmers or protocol

489
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:46,879
designers uh

490
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:51,440
for example in this case uh the the

491
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:55,039
the uh we are talking about activity pub

492
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:57,039
being the protocol and uh

493
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:58,400
from the point of view of the instance

494
00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:01,600
admins

495
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:03,280
because they are the the ones that are

496
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:05,199
processing or they are controlling

497
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,639
information in the sense of the

498
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:09,520
framework of the gdpr

499
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:11,039
are we talking about a data processor or

500
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:13,760
a data controller

501
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:16,320
and i asked this question and uh the

502
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:18,240
conclusion that i reached is that uh and

503
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,600
it's a personal conclusion it's the fact

504
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,919
that if

505
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:23,600
you are just a simple admin who just

506
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:25,440
installs for example mastodon or

507
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:27,439
pleroman has no idea how

508
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,120
they are working you should be treated

509
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:32,080
as a processor from the perspective of

510
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:34,080
the gdpr for example but if you are

511
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,918
someone who writes a fetiverse instance

512
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:38,000
for example that collects all the data

513
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:40,400
in order to do analytics and not tech

514
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,440
in that situation you should be seen as

515
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,600
a controller

516
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:45,919
in the sense of the gdpr however the

517
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,879
framework that the gdpr is proposing is

518
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:50,240
a framework that

519
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:52,720
is not very specifically applied to this

520
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:55,120
situation so it's just an interpretation

521
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:56,880
at this point

522
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:58,639
now in terms of what we should do

523
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,799
further in order to

524
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:02,559
ameliorate to to make the situation

525
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:04,960
better from the point of view of the

526
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:05,918
legislators legislators should align

527
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,000
legislation

528
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:10,240
with tech particularities and also they

529
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,120
should keep up basically with the tech

530
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,960
innovation

531
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:14,719
because i'm not sure exactly if this

532
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,760
might be a reason but when the gdpr

533
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,000
started to be

534
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:21,039
a thing and people started to discuss

535
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,960
about it around 2012

536
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:24,559
in that situation decentralized social

537
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,400
media was very at the beginning so maybe

538
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:26,799
they did not took into consideration

539
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,480
this

540
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:30,080
particular situation this particular

541
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:32,080
framework however

542
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:34,159
things are moving and in the future i do

543
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:36,159
expect that we will have clear answers

544
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,880
about how to tackle the suspects and we

545
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:39,520
will not

546
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,960
uh we will not uh remain with questions

547
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:43,039
unanswered basically

548
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:44,880
and also from the point of view of

549
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:46,320
technology because we also have some

550
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,080
issues from this point of view

551
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:50,159
technology should align to large

552
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:52,480
principle of privacy by design

553
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:54,240
uh because decentralization alone with

554
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,200
all those principles that i was stating

555
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:57,360
in my talk

556
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:59,360
decentralization alone is not enough to

557
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,159
be a better alternative to centralized

558
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:02,559
systems

559
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:03,600
uh privacy wise it needs to be doubled

560
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:06,158
by other

561
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:08,320
uh privacy strategies because if you

562
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:10,880
have a system which is decentralized

563
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:13,360
that doesn't mean that you are compliant

564
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:15,520
with privacy by design alone it does not

565
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:17,840
get you to compliance however

566
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:20,080
if there exists such a thing as a social

567
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:23,199
media network which is ideal

568
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:25,039
uh and incorporates all eight principles

569
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,640
if that network definitely should be

570
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:30,320
decentralized

571
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:32,480
um so

572
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:33,600
that was it we still have five minutes

573
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:36,720
for questions

574
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:39,199
and uh feel free to contact me i will

575
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:42,799
however post the slides

576
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:46,000
after after this this talk

577
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:49,840
and um and thank you very much for

578
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,840
for attending it

579
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:56,480
let's give one extra applause for

580
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:00,000
persevering and giving an amazing talk

581
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:00,000
during the most distracting

582
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:06,210
does anyone have circumstances questions

583
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:06,210
[Applause]

584
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:19,520
thank you so on you said that

585
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:22,320
essentially decentralized um social

586
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,320
media doesn't

587
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:26,159
or isn't covered by the gdpr because it

588
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,919
only focuses on controllers and

589
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:29,440
processors which is of course correct

590
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:30,480
but i would argue well there's also a

591
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,080
joint controllership

592
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:34,159
we just don't know what it means yet and

593
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:37,840
how to interpret it exactly

594
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:39,679
exactly um and on the other hand if you

595
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,959
look at like the ecj decisions that are

596
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:42,400
coming out

597
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,679
we're actually getting to a point where

598
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,480
it's pretty clear that all of that is

599
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:45,840
covered

600
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:47,280
and they are actually all just showing

601
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,879
controllers which doesn't make it any

602
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:50,720
better because then you just get to

603
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:52,080
get into the whole discussion around

604
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,200
what contracts do you need to put in

605
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:55,520
place right

606
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,640
um but i would say it's it's very much

607
00:21:55,520 --> 00:22:00,158
covered um

608
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:03,039
it's just really hard to implement

609
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:04,159
the gdpr properly in that kind of

610
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:05,840
context right

611
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:07,200
um that's one comment i would have not

612
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:10,959
really a question the other thing

613
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:14,159
um blockchains and right to be forgotten

614
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:16,720
um isn't the reason

615
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:17,280
for the right to be forgotten to be

616
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,360
sorry

617
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:20,639
for the right to be forgotten to be hard

618
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:23,360
in that context

619
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:25,120
that you actually oh not you but

620
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:28,559
controllers actually

621
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:31,840
stretch the consent

622
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:34,399
as legal basis and don't rely

623
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:35,840
on contracts for example sufficiently

624
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:39,039
enough

625
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:41,199
well according according to the gdpr

626
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:42,799
it's not just consent the reason why we

627
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:45,039
are processing personal data

628
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:46,639
but it is basically a best practice

629
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:48,158
because if we would have an informed

630
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:51,360
free given consent

631
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:53,679
uh then it would be very very nice to uh

632
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:55,600
to process personal data based on that

633
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:56,960
consent or that contract because in the

634
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:59,360
end the contract is giving

635
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:01,679
consent but it's not it's just treated

636
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:05,120
separated from this point of view

637
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:06,320
uh i would i would say that we also have

638
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:08,719
legitimate interest

639
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:09,760
and usually uh technologies that do not

640
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,159
answer do not

641
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:14,320
uh enter in situations of having a

642
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:17,520
contract or in having uh

643
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:19,840
uh or having consent freely given

644
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:21,120
uh then we also have legitimate interest

645
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:24,080
it's it's a trap

646
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:24,799
basically a a technical trap let's call

647
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:27,199
it like that

648
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:28,720
but uh it's something that definitely

649
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,080
can have an answer from the point of

650
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,799
view of the law because the law however

651
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:34,799
needs to be

652
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:34,799
interpreted and applied to specific

653
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:39,439
situations

654
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:41,200
thanks for your talk um did you have a

655
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:42,799
look at uh secure scuttlebutt where you

656
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,799
own your own data

657
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:46,879
in the social network and if yes what do

658
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:50,559
you think about it

659
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:52,240
i am not i do not hear the question

660
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:54,158
um did you have a look at secure

661
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:56,559
scuttlebutt via you own your

662
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:57,520
social media data and what do you think

663
00:23:56,559 --> 00:24:00,158
about it if you

664
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:03,440
took a look at this i i did not i heard

665
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:04,960
about it but i did not look at it

666
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:08,400
i i think we're out of time let's give

667
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:08,400
another round of applause thank you

668
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:26,320
no it's okay i'm not do not no i'm not

669
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:26,320
eating but yeah it was a pleasure
