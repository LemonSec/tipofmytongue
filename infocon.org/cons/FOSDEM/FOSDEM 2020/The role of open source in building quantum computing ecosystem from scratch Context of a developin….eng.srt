1
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:11,679
all right

2
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,840
thanks guys for joining us for another

3
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:14,960
12 in the session so the next next

4
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:19,198
speaker is

5
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:21,760
hack i hope i pronounced it correctly

6
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:23,199
he's currently the director of gate 42

7
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:26,400
quantum computing lab

8
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:29,039
in armenia and an associate professor

9
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,400
at the armenian university of american

10
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:34,399
university of armenia

11
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:37,600
he holds a phd in quantum optics from

12
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:40,800
universe that federal daminas gerais or

13
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,800
ufmg and from brazil

14
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,879
it's actually working on creation of

15
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,640
free and open source learning resources

16
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:49,039
as part of gate 42

17
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,480
and you can find them on github today he

18
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:52,879
will talk about

19
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,559
the role of open source and building

20
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:55,839
quantum computing ecosystems from from

21
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:59,839
scratch

22
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,840
please welcome the speaker

23
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:10,080
thank you can you hear me

24
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:12,720
so the the goal of my talk will be

25
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,840
for example if you are not a grand

26
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,759
company google

27
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:20,320
ibm or righty or any and

28
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:21,840
then how how can you get involved in

29
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:25,520
quantum computing and

30
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:28,000
how can you do with

31
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:30,720
quantum computing that turns out there

32
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,560
are lots of open sources you can start

33
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:38,640
learning and also when learning

34
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:40,000
you can also share what you learn with

35
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,040
others it's a

36
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,240
good experience and also teach

37
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:48,240
so the country i come from is armenia

38
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:51,199
which is a developing country

39
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,199
and it's a

40
00:01:53,439 --> 00:02:00,320
it doesn't okay so

41
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:03,680
um i will talk about uh the country

42
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:06,320
uh armenia uh developing country

43
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,360
and how quantum computing uh entered in

44
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:10,000
armenia

45
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:11,840
and then i in the second part of my talk

46
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,160
i will talk about the projects

47
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:18,080
we are working with in gate 42

48
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,280
i will focus on error mitigation

49
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,959
techniques

50
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:26,640
uh project by

51
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:29,920
we applied for a unit in unitary fund

52
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:33,760
wheelzing runs unif units refund and

53
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:36,000
some other projects molecular similarity

54
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:37,679
and crown chemistry and quantum networks

55
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,720
which you can find in our

56
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:44,400
github so armenia is a

57
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:48,800
very small country population 33 million

58
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:51,440
and diaspora is 8 million and

59
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,519
it's been famous in the soviet union as

60
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:56,560
a silicon valley

61
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:58,480
of soviet union but uh as you know

62
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,400
soviet union was closed and nobody

63
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:02,399
outside of that didn't know what was

64
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,280
happening inside soviet union

65
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:07,280
and mainly was good at computing and

66
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,599
electronics and high quality stem

67
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:12,959
education

68
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:15,599
but uh at this moment uh no quantum

69
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:19,519
computing course was taught in

70
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:23,280
in armenia so

71
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:23,680
the total number of stem students is a

72
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,280
bit

73
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:30,840
above 10 000 from almost

74
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:34,720
70 000 bachelor students

75
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:37,280
overall and it's it's growing uh so the

76
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,239
interest in stem is is growing it's a

77
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:42,080
good thing and then

78
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:45,280
the recent report from world bank also

79
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:47,440
say some good stuff among other

80
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,720
other areas they mentioned also about

81
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:52,400
quantum computing

82
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:54,480
so armenia is strong from eda and

83
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,799
which is highly relevant for quantum

84
00:03:54,480 --> 00:04:00,399
computing development it's their words

85
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:01,280
and uh quantum national quantum strategy

86
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,000
is needed

87
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,720
and in international collaboration they

88
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,680
recommend

89
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:08,560
to build capacity and relevance in nasa

90
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:12,640
and technologies

91
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,640
while they are still accessible

92
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:16,399
so some more facts and then i will go to

93
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,519
the projects

94
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:22,560
uh the tech industry in armenia is

95
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:27,120
really thriving and

96
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:31,120
from 2006 to 2018

97
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:34,479
the gdp uh was uh from one to seven

98
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:36,639
point four percent and favorable tax uh

99
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:37,520
uh regime for tech companies if you want

100
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:40,320
to build a

101
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,719
company in armenia that's a good thing

102
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:44,560
but

103
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:48,080
uh from uh natural sciences

104
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:51,120
viewpoint it's a really kind of disaster

105
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:53,599
a very big accelerary gap gap

106
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,960
people from natural sciences once they

107
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,759
they

108
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:59,120
finish their bachelor's they go outside

109
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:02,400
so brain drain happens

110
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,400
so we need to fix this

111
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:07,120
just yesterday forbes said that welcome

112
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:08,240
to the world's next tech up so i hope

113
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,840
this this becomes

114
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:14,720
true for for armenia

115
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,679
okay i'll talk about now uh gate 42 and

116
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,479
uh

117
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,759
and our projects gate43 is a non-profit

118
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:22,800
foundation

119
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:27,120
founded in 2018 uh

120
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:29,919
which is uh mainly based on fundings and

121
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,919
donations from from tech companies

122
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:34,479
smartgate rafa solutions

123
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:38,960
and hex division and also individual

124
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:42,960
donations so

125
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:44,560
and with gate 42 we

126
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,880
what to do in in this kind of when you

127
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:49,919
are in this situation what to do it

128
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:53,039
uh whether you want to have more control

129
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:57,280
or collaborate compete or execute

130
00:05:53,039 --> 00:06:00,400
so in this sense we are in the

131
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:04,000
in this bottom bottom part bottom

132
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:07,840
left part and we also have to do some

133
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,880
some innovations to get say new users

134
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,599
because

135
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:13,680
there is nothing you you have to do you

136
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:16,880
have to do something to engage people

137
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,520
to to to start doing quantum computing

138
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:22,319
and

139
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:25,280
not only students but also you have to

140
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:26,960
persuade a government also to to adopt

141
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:30,318
some some national strategy one

142
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:34,159
one way is to just popularize it we

143
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:37,039
we had there are some conferences

144
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,240
we have uh asked them to add some

145
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:41,919
quantum tracks

146
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,720
we went there and presented uh our works

147
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:45,919
there

148
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:49,840
uh the the

149
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:53,280
uh wilson was there also last year

150
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:54,400
and there are also some some interesting

151
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:57,119
things we want to

152
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:58,159
also innovate get school school children

153
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,120
also involved

154
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,440
so these bottom two images are creation

155
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:05,120
of

156
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:08,240
children uh that they kind of

157
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:09,520
mix uh we we present some situation from

158
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,400
quantum they

159
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:14,240
just uh do some art and connect armenian

160
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:16,560
proverbs and then quantum computing

161
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:20,639
together so it's a kind of a small

162
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:23,840
project that we will do

163
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:27,599
next and we have also 200 and

164
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:29,359
about 40 members in facebook group

165
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:32,240
an active group we share some

166
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:36,639
information and discuss

167
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:39,120
okay so now i will turn to our projects

168
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:42,080
so on the research side we we do quantum

169
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:45,280
chemistry quantum networks

170
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:48,159
error mitigation from units refund and

171
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:50,479
molecular similarity on the education

172
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,479
side

173
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:56,319
by talking to other universities to the

174
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,440
universities there

175
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:02,400
they just started one by one started

176
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:03,360
teaching quantum computing in in their

177
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:06,400
included in their

178
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:08,800
curriculum so i i started teaching

179
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:11,520
quantum computing in the uni american

180
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:14,560
university of armenia

181
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:17,440
this january and we are

182
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,960
going to do a quantum computing course

183
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:22,719
uh hands-on course

184
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:27,280
coding in kiskit pikeville and all other

185
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:31,680
frameworks in the innovation center

186
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:31,679
for science and technology

187
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:38,240
starting in february the

188
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:42,479
open source frameworks we use

189
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:46,640
are these ones pike wheel kiskeet

190
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:49,120
strawberry fields uh penny lane also

191
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,240
d-wave and simulacron i think that there

192
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,399
will be a talk

193
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,440
about simulacrum here but we have

194
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:56,560
already heard

195
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:58,800
about the rest here and there are also

196
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:00,800
some other tools open source tools like

197
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:04,000
open fermion pi gsti

198
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:07,040
qe4 and q-tip which are great things to

199
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,760
to do some some things in the in the

200
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:11,279
middle

201
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:14,160
when you're doing some problem

202
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:16,959
so in our github you can find the error

203
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:20,800
mitigation techniques implemented in

204
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:25,040
in both pi wheel and kiskit

205
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:28,399
also some bb 84 which is a cryptography

206
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:30,560
uh protocol uh when you encode your

207
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:34,800
classical messages you you

208
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:37,839
encode uh with a bit string generated

209
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:39,120
with the with means of quantum so it's a

210
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:41,279
quantum chart

211
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,160
uh molecular similarity it's not in the

212
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:45,680
github yet but

213
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:46,399
we are working and it's uh using open

214
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:49,680
fermion

215
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:53,839
as well as uh zenedus

216
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:57,040
strawberry fields gaussian boson sampler

217
00:09:53,839 --> 00:10:00,160
well there are some tutorials

218
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:02,560
and the guides guide to enter a

219
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:03,360
quantum computing field with lots of

220
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:06,719
resources

221
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:08,800
please check out okay so the error

222
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,880
mitigation i i will mainly talk about

223
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:14,240
these error mitigation techniques

224
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:16,399
and it it's about noise and we

225
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,880
we have we already heard that uh from

226
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:22,079
the last talk that when you want to do

227
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:25,680
quantum computation there are

228
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:28,800
you have qubits so let's say ions

229
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:31,439
or superconducting circuits etc

230
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,719
and then you want to apply some gates

231
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:36,320
but these gates

232
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:38,880
can be noisy also the environment

233
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:40,160
can also affect the state of the qubit

234
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,640
and

235
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:44,000
decohere the state the coheres this

236
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:47,760
that's the word

237
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:50,320
and the processes uh that the quantum

238
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:51,360
quantum state goes through these

239
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:54,560
channels

240
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,959
are the simplest ones are usually uh

241
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:58,479
called

242
00:10:54,959 --> 00:11:02,319
depolarization channel where

243
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:03,200
um just uh from any parts of the block

244
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,440
sphere

245
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:07,519
that there are some errors with flips

246
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,640
and then your blog sphere just shrinks

247
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:10,320
down in this

248
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:12,319
in this case and then you you lose

249
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:15,120
information and the state

250
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,600
from from pure it becomes a mixed state

251
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,000
and

252
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:20,320
another is the coherence which can be

253
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,839
dephasing and amplitude damping

254
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:26,720
well dephasing is is when for example

255
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:28,320
you create a superposition state which

256
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:31,279
means you take your

257
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,760
qubit from the zero state to the equator

258
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:34,320
and

259
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,800
as the states on the equator of blocks

260
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,839
where

261
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:41,120
are the equal superpositions of zero

262
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:42,000
and one so sometimes can be one

263
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:45,279
component

264
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:48,000
just uh go to go to

265
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:49,279
zero because of uh because of the

266
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,320
interaction from

267
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:52,880
uh with the environment and then because

268
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,240
of this

269
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:59,920
uh the block sphere shrinks in this

270
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:02,959
towards the z axis so you you lose the

271
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:06,880
superposition you you lose the coherence

272
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:06,880
and also amplitude damping

273
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,359
which which has similar meaning and the

274
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:14,720
block sphere

275
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:17,600
well i i guess i i i confused this one

276
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,959
is when when the one component of of the

277
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:24,000
superposition

278
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:26,638
goes to zero so these are

279
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,279
two channels to to describe and model

280
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:30,480
noise

281
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:31,279
noise and the noise processes themselves

282
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:34,560
can be

283
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:36,399
two of two types systematic like you

284
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:38,719
you physically implement it you

285
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:40,320
physically have a gate to apply to a

286
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,880
qubit

287
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,600
for for it to to rotate for for some

288
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,439
amount and

289
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,120
that's that would be your gate for

290
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:49,839
example there

291
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,839
we are supposed to do an x-gate but it

292
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:53,680
over-rotates around the rotates and it's

293
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:55,040
a systematic error and each time it does

294
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:59,680
the same so

295
00:12:55,040 --> 00:13:02,000
by calibrating your hardware and

296
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:03,199
improving your hardware you can correct

297
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,399
this kind of

298
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:10,320
this kind of errors in in

299
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:11,120
drives drives microwaves or lasers for

300
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:14,000
for different

301
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:15,040
kinds of qubits so these appear as

302
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,240
noises when

303
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:21,199
when they are implemented with

304
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,760
other other gates in in sequence and in

305
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,760
the end

306
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,880
they appear noise but in fact they are

307
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,439
systematic things

308
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,800
that can be calibrated and there is also

309
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:32,480
a stochastic

310
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:34,959
uh noise which which comes from

311
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,760
from from the environment of your qubit

312
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:38,399
for example

313
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:39,279
if in the in the case of superconductor

314
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:41,440
circuit

315
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:42,320
there are different processes going on

316
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:45,199
and

317
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:47,040
uh for example flux of magnetic field

318
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:49,439
photons phonons enter and

319
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:52,160
go out and they are uncontrollable so

320
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:55,680
these are more stochastic

321
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:58,560
some parameters some parameter

322
00:13:55,680 --> 00:14:00,160
fluctuates and you don't have a control

323
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:02,880
so fluctuations in the

324
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:03,920
amplitude of the control field let's say

325
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:08,000
it's it's a

326
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:11,839
laser or a microwave so uh can

327
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:15,920
can cause uh so you you would have a

328
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:17,360
real sinusoid here but because of this

329
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:20,560
fluctuations

330
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:23,920
you you lose the thing that

331
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,920
your gate was supposed to do

332
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:32,639
fidelity is a measure by which you can

333
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:33,439
test whether your gauge or the state of

334
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:36,800
the qubit

335
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:38,160
you prepared via gates is

336
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,839
is the same as mathematically

337
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:42,319
constructed one

338
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:44,959
so this is some kind of metric uh you

339
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,959
want to

340
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:51,360
quantify your process or or

341
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:52,000
state so process is also some kind of

342
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,920
operation

343
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,279
which is supposed to be the ideal gate

344
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:58,719
but sometimes they are

345
00:14:55,279 --> 00:15:01,360
not as ideal as you want so because

346
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,320
instead of a unitary operation they they

347
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:05,360
become

348
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:08,480
probably not not not unitary so

349
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:09,920
but these uh two two things uh state

350
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:13,680
tomography and

351
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:16,880
process tomography i are really resource

352
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:19,519
consuming things and

353
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:21,839
they they they grow exponentially with

354
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:24,959
the number of qubits you want to

355
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:28,560
uh measure the the state or the

356
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:30,399
the processes and there is also

357
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:32,560
another technique called randomized

358
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:36,639
benchmarking which which gives the

359
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:39,680
net error rate so this one

360
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:42,000
in the bottom at the bottom is is you

361
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:43,680
have some known well calibrated gates

362
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,399
and you want to

363
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:48,560
check whether your new gates are

364
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:51,680
performing well or not

365
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:54,959
so you sequentially increase the depth

366
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:58,000
of these gates and interleave with

367
00:15:54,959 --> 00:16:01,119
with the unknown gates the green ones

368
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:03,519
on the slide and then uh you run

369
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,959
the same circuit without the new gates

370
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:08,320
and the difference

371
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:11,279
somehow gives you the the performance of

372
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:14,480
your new gates you want to

373
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:14,880
evaluate performance and you keep doing

374
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,519
this

375
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:19,920
increasingly deeper and deeper and you

376
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:19,920
you get

377
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:26,480
the net net error rate of of

378
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:30,160
gates of of of some

379
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:33,360
toolkit of gates not just one one gate

380
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:36,160
and these are formulas for computing

381
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,680
fidelities the first one is for state

382
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:41,839
tomography if you have

383
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:43,920
the state sigma and you

384
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:45,839
mathematically you want to prepare state

385
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:48,839
sigma but what you do

386
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:50,320
comes out as raw and this is the the way

387
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:52,720
to

388
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:54,160
compute the formula the second one is

389
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,000
for for gates

390
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:57,360
to compute the gate with led and the

391
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,160
third one is

392
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,720
uh entanglement fidelity of the gate

393
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:04,000
which is

394
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:07,280
more uh which is better

395
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,679
quantity to to measure gate fidelity

396
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:11,839
but it's difficult to realize

397
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:13,760
experimentally

398
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:15,839
but experimentally it's easy to to do

399
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:18,240
the what's called mean

400
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:20,000
mean gate fidelity and then there is a

401
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:22,400
connection

402
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,679
between this mean fidelity and

403
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:27,679
entanglement

404
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:30,080
fidelity okay how to

405
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:32,480
combat this noise when you when you have

406
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:36,000
noisy hardware and noisy gates

407
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:38,880
and what to do

408
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,559
first thing you have to understand the

409
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:43,679
noise

410
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:45,360
for example this is in the frequency

411
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:47,120
domain when the process processes

412
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:49,918
surrounding your qubit

413
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:51,918
are too many and too complicated but you

414
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:53,679
can get some insight from the

415
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:54,960
frequency domain there are some low

416
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:57,039
frequency noise

417
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,720
there is this thermal noise which is

418
00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:01,280
proportional to temperature

419
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:03,039
there is this nyquist noise which is

420
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:06,080
which is quantum noise and which

421
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:10,000
is not symmetric because for example if

422
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:13,439
you are in the absolute zero temperature

423
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:16,160
uh you can the qubit can

424
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:17,679
give energy to the environment and

425
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:21,120
cannot get back because the

426
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:24,880
environment is in the vacuum state

427
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:27,199
so on the on the left of the

428
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:28,960
diagram is when qubit absorbs from the

429
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,240
environment these are the frequencies

430
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:33,280
and on the right

431
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:36,320
when when is when the qubit gives to

432
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:39,918
to the environment some some energy

433
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:41,520
so the ideally if

434
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:44,320
if you are an engineer from the

435
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,320
engineering pro

436
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,679
perspective the qubit frequencies are

437
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:50,799
here

438
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:53,919
this omega q and minus omega q you would

439
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:57,918
probably want to put some filters

440
00:18:53,919 --> 00:19:02,240
in this region in order to have

441
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:02,240
to to filter outside

442
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:09,039
outside interactions interactions coming

443
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:13,039
from outside and

444
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:15,120
and leave some some window open for

445
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:17,039
just for your gate when you apply a gate

446
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,639
because environment is also some kind of

447
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:20,480
gate applying continuously

448
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:22,400
on your qubit and spoiling everything

449
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:26,160
you want to do but if you

450
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:28,799
do the filter you can

451
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:30,960
protect your qubit so it turns out when

452
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:30,960
you

453
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:37,280
do this filter in a frequency domain

454
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,160
in the time domain it corresponds to a

455
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:41,440
some kind of

456
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:44,000
pulse sequences and

457
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,640
these pulse sequences are usually called

458
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,840
spin

459
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:50,400
echo or dynamical decoupling but

460
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:51,120
there are many there are some many

461
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,200
papers

462
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:55,360
with different techniques so with

463
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:57,360
dynamical decoupling you are doing

464
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:59,039
exactly this you are creating filter in

465
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:01,840
the time domain so you apply

466
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:03,600
you are applying some pulses in in some

467
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:06,158
defined intervals

468
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,959
which turns out is the filter you want

469
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:10,480
to

470
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:12,720
you want to do so uh for this for

471
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:15,200
example this one is the hamiltonian

472
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:17,440
for the system and the b is the

473
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:20,320
environment bath and

474
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:21,120
and the noise term can be constructed as

475
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:24,240
this

476
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:26,719
and then you control is the

477
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,919
drive field you you want to apply so if

478
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:33,280
you do

479
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:36,200
z so so this zx zx are the pauli

480
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:38,000
matrices or public gates so if you do

481
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:42,080
zxzx

482
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:46,240
uh the qubit will return

483
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:48,720
uh where it was it started from

484
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:51,600
but if you don't do this and just wait

485
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:53,440
qubit will lose its coherence and go to

486
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:55,199
some other place in the on the block

487
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:58,480
sphere if you do this

488
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:59,600
like kind of you are waking up the qubit

489
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:01,679
or cubits

490
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:03,280
qubit wants to die during the

491
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:06,799
interaction with the environment but

492
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:10,960
when you interfere and go and

493
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:13,200
apply these pulses qubit starts to

494
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:14,559
come back where it was and then you you

495
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:17,440
apply a gate so this

496
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:19,760
the third equation here is and another

497
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:23,039
technique

498
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:26,400
for uh gates not just

499
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:27,360
qubits if you want to stay in the in the

500
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:31,280
same state

501
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:34,559
as it it it was before like memory

502
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:37,760
but in this case you protect also

503
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:41,039
gates with these dd sequences

504
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:44,240
and here is the diagram pulse width

505
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:45,360
and with and pulse interval if you

506
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:49,200
choose correctly

507
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:51,840
usually when you start to model and

508
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,400
do coding with this it's really hard to

509
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:55,760
find the

510
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:56,720
the right parameters to to actually make

511
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:59,600
this work

512
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:00,400
so this is some kind of optimization

513
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,559
needed to

514
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,559
do

515
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:11,039
okay with the memory case uh

516
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:13,120
so the idea is to prepare a circuit here

517
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:14,960
made of uh so this is the state

518
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:18,000
preparation part

519
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:21,679
uh these unitaries are made of

520
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,240
uh hadamard t gate square root x squared

521
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:24,400
y

522
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:27,280
and if the it's uh more than one qubit

523
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:30,159
also controls that

524
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:30,799
operations so you randomly sample from

525
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:33,280
from

526
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:34,720
this set of gates and then you apply to

527
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:37,760
to state zero

528
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:41,120
and then you prepare your state and just

529
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:42,400
in one case you just wait and in the

530
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:45,360
other case you apply

531
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:46,080
x y x y or x z x it it really doesn't

532
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:49,840
matter

533
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:53,280
and in the plots we see that the

534
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:54,320
this technique really works because the

535
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:57,600
fidelity

536
00:22:54,320 --> 00:23:01,280
we measure in the end is

537
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:01,280
is higher than than the other one

538
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:08,080
there is another technique called

539
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:09,360
richardson extrapolation to the zero

540
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:12,879
noise limit this is

541
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:13,360
uh needed when you you apply this when

542
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:16,960
you

543
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:20,080
want to compute or calculate the

544
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:22,880
expected value of some observable

545
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:23,840
you want to measure in the beginning you

546
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,640
expanded

547
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:27,600
in a power series here where the

548
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:30,640
coefficients

549
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:33,280
depend on the noise model and these

550
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:36,400
lambdas are small noise parameters

551
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:39,280
and we you want this ideal

552
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:42,400
case when when there is no noise your

553
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:46,080
expectation value of the observable

554
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:50,799
is the zeroth term of the expansion

555
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:54,799
well the this technique uh says okay you

556
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:57,760
you run your circuit and then you run it

557
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:58,799
noisy circuit and then you run it the

558
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:01,440
same circuit but

559
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:03,120
this time all the gates as pulses

560
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:06,559
stretched

561
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:09,199
or just increase the noise parameter

562
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:11,279
and then you keep doing this and take

563
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:13,600
this

564
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:15,600
measurement from all these circuits

565
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:17,918
measurements of these noisy

566
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:19,600
expected values for different noise

567
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:22,240
parameters here

568
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:25,120
and then there is this set of equations

569
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:27,039
linear equations you solve for gamma

570
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:28,639
you find the gamma and then you you

571
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:32,640
construct this

572
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:35,200
uh this and this should converge to the

573
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:37,440
ideal case this is the richardson's

574
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:39,760
approach the details are in this paper

575
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:42,799
we reproduced

576
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:45,760
this for for

577
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:47,200
memory case and then you can't go to the

578
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:50,480
first second and third

579
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:53,840
orders uh we see improvements here

580
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:54,559
and also we we did so this is fidelity

581
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:57,439
which is

582
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:58,559
equivalent for measuring poly sigma z

583
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:00,799
expected value but

584
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:02,240
in this case this is for hydrogen

585
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:05,279
molecule

586
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:07,600
we we did this uh expected value

587
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:08,720
of the energy of hydrogen molecule and

588
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:11,918
we see that

589
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:13,440
with no noise and with noise and in the

590
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:17,279
middle here is the

591
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:17,279
mitigated case we see that it

592
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,918
it works

593
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:28,159
there is one more

594
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:31,120
another technique called q vector which

595
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:34,960
is quantum variational error corrector

596
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:37,600
so this circuit is uh supposed to

597
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:39,679
kind of incr when you when you want to

598
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:42,158
do logical operations already error

599
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:45,200
corrected uh

600
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:46,159
computation but we know that for now we

601
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,840
don't have

602
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:49,279
error correction and fault tolerant

603
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:52,320
computers

604
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:55,600
but the idea is first you

605
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:58,960
prepare your state s so let's say it's

606
00:25:55,600 --> 00:26:00,959
zero zero plus one one so this is the

607
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:02,400
state you want to encode in the logical

608
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:06,799
level not in the physical

609
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:10,559
level this the second part vp

610
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:13,679
uh should do that encoding

611
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:14,399
from the logical the logical state you

612
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:16,480
want

613
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:18,480
from the physical to already logical

614
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:21,600
level we know that

615
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:26,480
logical qubits need

616
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:28,799
to be constructed at least with

617
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:29,760
five qubits one load so steam scroll

618
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:32,879
this five

619
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:36,240
distance five and then there is

620
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:40,000
also when there is noise this

621
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:42,320
third part does the recovery process

622
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,520
and then you reverse everything in order

623
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:46,320
to

624
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:46,960
have reversible computation and then you

625
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:50,080
feed this

626
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:53,279
uh in into the loop

627
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:57,600
find the and specify the cost function

628
00:26:53,279 --> 00:27:00,240
or as the ability average code fidelity

629
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:01,039
or so-called the ability of the encoded

630
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:04,320
recovery

631
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:06,480
circuit w here and then you do classical

632
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:09,520
optimization until you find the

633
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:12,880
parameters you prepared

634
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:17,679
for this vp and also wp

635
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:20,000
wq the parameters that

636
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:21,360
are optimized and give the the right

637
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,960
result

638
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:28,320
and this vp is just

639
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:34,240
made of paulie matrices public gates and

640
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:37,439
control z gates

641
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:39,520
so the paper also did the paper

642
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:42,159
considered three qubit case and five

643
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:42,158
qubit case

644
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:47,840
for three qubit case i i guess it's just

645
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:50,480
a an error mitigation technique not

646
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:53,600
logical level encoding but five

647
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:57,039
could be considered so so

648
00:27:53,600 --> 00:28:00,320
uh another ongoing work we are doing

649
00:27:57,039 --> 00:28:03,760
is uh so a few few weeks ago

650
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:07,120
q controls team published their paper

651
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:10,799
on archive this one and it's a

652
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:14,559
really fantastic paper they are

653
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:18,000
doing uh control in the

654
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:21,120
lower levels of of the stack and

655
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:23,520
the the theory is is is is this the

656
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:25,520
the total hamiltonian of the field is

657
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:27,840
the control and also some errors that

658
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:30,720
might happen

659
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:32,399
so this is the schrodinger equation

660
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:34,000
let's say for the unit revolution

661
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:37,678
operator

662
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:40,720
and we want to do something that

663
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:44,720
this error term doesn't affect our

664
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:48,320
our operations so it can be expressed

665
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:50,399
this uh u tilde operator

666
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:52,080
in terms of this total and control that

667
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:55,360
dagger which is the

668
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:55,760
inverse of the unit tree and we want

669
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:59,760
that

670
00:28:55,760 --> 00:29:02,879
our target unitary or or the target gate

671
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:04,320
be this control which which is governed

672
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:07,039
by this hamiltonian

673
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:07,520
and the error gate will be just identity

674
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:10,720
that

675
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:13,120
says does nothing and this tilde means

676
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:17,600
that it's in the toggling frame

677
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:19,918
which is you original you and

678
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:21,678
you control your control dagger from

679
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:23,919
both sides

680
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:25,840
and the procedure is is the following

681
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:26,880
construct your hamiltonian error

682
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:30,080
hamiltonian

683
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:33,200
with the noise operators you you can do

684
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:36,559
like cross operators etc

685
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:37,919
then you can probably do this but it's

686
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:41,279
difficult

687
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:43,120
it's time ordered and because this is

688
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,440
time dependent hamiltonian it's really

689
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,678
hard

690
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:48,880
difficult to do but instead you could

691
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:52,080
you could use filter function

692
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:54,480
there is this formula for the infinite

693
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:55,520
infidelity so which is this is something

694
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:59,360
you measure from your

695
00:29:55,520 --> 00:30:01,360
quantum computer and this is expressed

696
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:04,559
with this filter function and this s is

697
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:07,279
this power spectral density

698
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:09,360
this filter this can be measured filter

699
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:12,240
function can be computed

700
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:12,959
using these noise operators you defined

701
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:16,640
with

702
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:18,960
your hamiltonian you they you take the

703
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,760
inverse fourier transform of this square

704
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:22,960
and

705
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:25,279
this this pi is just a

706
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:27,039
projector into the space you want to do

707
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:29,200
your computation

708
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:31,600
and once you have all this you can

709
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:34,480
deduce this sk with

710
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:35,039
other techniques which is more doable

711
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:38,320
than

712
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:38,320
just go directly here

713
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:43,600
so this is something that we are going

714
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:46,799
to

715
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:50,240
implement and include or in the uh

716
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:53,760
and make like one whole package

717
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:56,640
with this with our project we started

718
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:56,640
with units refund

719
00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:02,320
and one last thing uh is the

720
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:03,600
i want to talk about molecular

721
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:07,918
similarity

722
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:11,600
which is uh an interesting thing

723
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:14,480
to kind of compare molecules

724
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:15,199
there are some techniques approaches

725
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:17,440
people just

726
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:20,320
build the graphs of the molecules and

727
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:23,440
then they they compare

728
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:24,639
but here we want to do this uh

729
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:28,640
comparison with

730
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:32,000
directly hamiltonians so the idea is you

731
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:35,039
just with open fermion open fermion has

732
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,840
lots of functionality to work in quantum

733
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:39,200
chemistry

734
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:42,480
with open fermions you just take uh

735
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:45,679
construct the hamiltonian of uh

736
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:48,480
of molecules then from from this

737
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:51,760
hamiltonian in the second quantized form

738
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:54,960
these quantities

739
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:57,519
can be can be put in a matrix which is

740
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:58,799
which turns out to be symmetric matrix

741
00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:01,840
this one goes to the

742
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:03,760
go to the diagonal and the other ones to

743
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:07,360
the rest of the matrix

744
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:09,919
and then we switch to zenedus

745
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:11,519
gaussian boson sampler which accepts

746
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:15,840
symmetric matrices

747
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:15,840
and produces some feature vectors

748
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:22,000
so uh of course doing this uh

749
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:23,039
on a classical computer by simulating

750
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,799
everything is

751
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:28,799
really exponentially hard problem and

752
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:30,240
there are half nuns involved in this

753
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:33,360
computation but with

754
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:34,320
once boson sampler hardware is available

755
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:36,959
this is a

756
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:38,000
real world problem you can compare

757
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,679
different

758
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,760
so once once you have the feature

759
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:44,720
vectors then you

760
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:46,080
can do other classification clustering

761
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:50,480
or other machine learning

762
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:54,399
tasks to to to separate molecules with

763
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:58,960
with their similarity in hamiltonians

764
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:58,959
so hamiltonian is naturally uh

765
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:05,160
is kind of the the signature of

766
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:07,360
of uh the system

767
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:09,360
[Music]

768
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:10,719
so i guess that that's all and this is

769
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:13,519
our team

770
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:14,640
in in armenia so four of us are working

771
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:24,220
in these projects

772
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:26,399
so thank you for your attention

773
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:29,120
[Applause]

774
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:29,120
any questions

775
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:38,159
because the question just raise your

776
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:46,240
hand i'm going to come with a mic

777
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:46,240
okay well then in that case
