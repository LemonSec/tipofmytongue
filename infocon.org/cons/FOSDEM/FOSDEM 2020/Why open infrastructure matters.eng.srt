1
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,800
the next talk will be

2
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:10,719
from thierry carres he is the vice

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:13,040
president of engineering

4
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:14,239
at the openstack foundation and he will

5
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:17,710
present to us

6
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:23,359
why open infrastructure metals

7
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:27,439
[Applause]

8
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:29,840
so hello everyone a quick introduction

9
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:30,560
i've been actively contributing to a

10
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,840
number of

11
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,640
free and open source software

12
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:38,079
communities for the past 16 years

13
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:40,879
and my first first name was in 2005 and

14
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:41,440
back then it was very much like it is

15
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:43,360
today

16
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,760
except it was much more difficult to get

17
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,320
food there were no food trucks there

18
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,039
were no

19
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:52,160
open cafeteria and it was not as

20
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:55,199
pleasant as it is today

21
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:58,160
the idea behind this talk

22
00:00:55,199 --> 00:01:00,000
really started with the paradox we are

23
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:02,000
here at fosdem

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,239
the free and open source developers

25
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,600
european meeting

26
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:10,840
because we believe that open source

27
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:12,240
is a superior way of building superior

28
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:15,280
software

29
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:18,320
and yet if we look at

30
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:21,759
what we are using day to day

31
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:24,158
to write this software i'm seeing

32
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:25,520
like in dev rooms yesterday even in this

33
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:27,280
room today

34
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:29,920
even in the freedom track i'm seeing a

35
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:32,159
lot of macbooks out there

36
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:34,240
and sure those might run open some

37
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,640
software

38
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,600
but the operating system delivering it

39
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:41,200
to you

40
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:43,199
is very much proprietary so even here

41
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,560
in this temple of free and open source

42
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,880
software

43
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,159
people are using proprietary operating

44
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:51,039
system to build

45
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:51,439
open source software and before you

46
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,280
start

47
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:54,479
laying the blame on your neighbor in the

48
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,000
in the crowd

49
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:58,320
i'm pretty sure a lot of you are using

50
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,560
github

51
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,360
i've thought it's free as india for open

52
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,960
source projects

53
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,560
it's very convenient has lots of

54
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:08,079
features

55
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,360
but it's also not open source so can we

56
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,360
really say

57
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,720
that we believe that open source is a

58
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:16,000
superior way

59
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:18,560
of building superior software if we are

60
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,840
not trusting open source for things as

61
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,080
intimate as our laptops operating

62
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:25,440
systems

63
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,440
or are developing tooling

64
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:30,079
benjamin macko hill argues that free

65
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:33,120
software is only as

66
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:36,080
free as the tools you are using to

67
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:38,319
build it and i agree with that because

68
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,640
if you're using proprietary tools

69
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:42,560
to build open source software then

70
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,440
you're subject to the whims and the

71
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,680
limitations

72
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:48,560
of that service provider and your

73
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:51,680
software is not really free

74
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,239
the runtime side of this paradox is that

75
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,000
a lot

76
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:55,360
of the open source software that we

77
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,280
write today

78
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,040
ends up running on proprietary

79
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:02,480
infrastructure

80
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:05,040
and by cooperative infrastructure i mean

81
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:07,359
amazon web services google cloud or

82
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:09,920
microsoft azure

83
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,440
sure you might request a linux vm or a

84
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:13,920
kubernetes cluster to run your

85
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,599
applications on

86
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,958
but the infrastructure service

87
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:19,920
delivering that

88
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:22,000
vm or that cluster to you is very much

89
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:24,399
proprietary

90
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,760
so in the same way that will advocate

91
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,480
here for using more

92
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,760
open source in your development

93
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,399
infrastructure

94
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:34,560
in this talk i would like to advocate

95
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,959
that we do the same for our runtime

96
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,000
infrastructure and use open source

97
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,560
solutions

98
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,040
for providing infrastructure what we

99
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:45,680
call open infrastructure

100
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:47,840
because it's better but also because it

101
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,840
matters

102
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:52,319
and so first what do i mean by

103
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:52,640
development infrastructure what do i

104
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:54,560
mean

105
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:57,200
by runtime infrastructure or computing

106
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,200
infrastructure

107
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:01,120
and why do people need it if you look at

108
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,879
the history of computing

109
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,239
it's all about piling up layers and

110
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:06,000
abstractions

111
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:07,280
and this is primarily done for two

112
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,040
reasons

113
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,760
when there is market pressure on one

114
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,239
side when you have a given company

115
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,280
owning

116
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:16,320
a certain layer the way to displace the

117
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,040
old king

118
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,238
is by commoditizing that layer and

119
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,160
building a new layer

120
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:23,359
on top of it where differentiation is

121
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,160
happening

122
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:29,199
that's basically what microsoft did in

123
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,320
the 80s and the 90s to displace the ibm

124
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:33,440
pc platform

125
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:35,199
which was dominant at the time on the

126
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,639
other side there is developer pressure

127
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,880
developers are looking for more

128
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:42,000
convenience so they are interested

129
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:44,960
in building new layers to abstract the

130
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,040
differences between the lower layers

131
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,880
like web browsers being used as an

132
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:51,040
application platform

133
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:53,280
to abstract the differences between

134
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,800
operating systems

135
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,559
and this piling up of layers and

136
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,080
abstractions is happening on all sides

137
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,840
of our industry

138
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,440
like if you look at application delivery

139
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,239
for example traditionally you would

140
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:05,199
represent

141
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:08,000
applications like this like users on one

142
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:09,680
side and applications on the other

143
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,479
but the way you deliver those

144
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,720
applications has been evolving

145
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:16,880
20 years ago when i started you would

146
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:19,759
procure some physical hardware

147
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:21,120
and as an application deployer you would

148
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:22,960
install an operating system

149
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,560
and then all of your dependencies and

150
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,960
then your application

151
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:29,440
on top of that but we started to add

152
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,880
more and more layers

153
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,520
uh first we added hardware

154
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:36,240
virtualization abstracting the server

155
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:38,000
your application is running on from the

156
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:42,080
physical hardware that actually

157
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:44,240
runs it then we added a new layer

158
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,840
cloud apis to allow you to

159
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:49,520
programmatically access

160
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:51,679
those virtualized resources so you have

161
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:53,840
programmable infrastructure on one side

162
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:56,880
and cloud native applications

163
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:59,758
being deployed on top of that

164
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:01,600
more recently we added a new layer cloud

165
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:04,160
application deployment apis which is

166
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:06,479
basically what kubernetes provides

167
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,759
higher level primitives that you can use

168
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:10,318
to deploy complex

169
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:13,039
applications on this programmable

170
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:13,039
infrastructure

171
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:18,318
and so the infrastructure space has been

172
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:21,280
evolving we are seeing an evolution

173
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:23,840
towards with developers and application

174
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:27,119
deployers wanting to care less and less

175
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:28,560
about infrastructure details we are

176
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,319
seeing an evolution towards using

177
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,800
commodity hardware

178
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:33,360
so when your needs increase rather than

179
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,759
scaling

180
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,280
up and buying a larger server or more

181
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:40,800
specialized server

182
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:42,719
you scale out by buying a lot of simpler

183
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,720
similar machines and you spread the load

184
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,080
among them

185
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,720
we are seeing an evolution towards

186
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:52,639
commoditized runtime environments

187
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:55,599
so rather than having a highly curated

188
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:56,319
entune runtime environment that you have

189
00:06:55,599 --> 00:07:00,400
to make sure

190
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:02,560
it never dies you are moving towards

191
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:04,400
using disposable easy to recreate

192
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,960
runtime environments that you can easily

193
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:08,719
kill

194
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:11,039
and recreate from scratch

195
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:13,440
and we're seeing an evolution towards

196
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:15,599
lighter and lighter runtimes so

197
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:18,479
we from physical machines to virtual

198
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:20,000
machines to containers to functions

199
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:23,120
and there is no reason to think that

200
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,120
this evolution will stop there

201
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:27,120
and finally as we add those abstractions

202
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:29,120
the share of complexity that is handled

203
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,440
by software compared to hardware

204
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:33,360
is increasing in order to optimize

205
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:36,400
utilization in order to

206
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:39,039
reduce development and deployment times

207
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:40,560
or costs to change more often to react

208
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:41,840
faster

209
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,080
so we are building more and more of

210
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:46,318
those layers in the infrastructure

211
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,919
space and as you pile up those

212
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:49,840
abstractions

213
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:51,520
it's clear that there is a growing

214
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:53,198
separate role of providing

215
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:56,159
infrastructure for others

216
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:57,759
to deploy their applications on and this

217
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,000
is really the population that we care

218
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:00,319
about

219
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,240
when we are talking about providing open

220
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:03,840
infrastructure solutions

221
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,759
the people that provide that

222
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,599
infrastructure can be

223
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:09,520
private infrastructure for the needs of

224
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:12,000
a given organization

225
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:13,680
or it can be public infrastructure for

226
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,639
anyone around the world with a credit

227
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,680
card

228
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:18,800
but it's the same job and that's really

229
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,440
the new role that we're trying to

230
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,440
facilitate

231
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:25,039
so now that we set the stage and explain

232
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,960
what we mean by um

233
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:29,280
by computing infrastructure and the

234
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:31,599
people that are actually trying to serve

235
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:33,838
why should you adopt open infrastructure

236
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:35,760
why should you prefer it over

237
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:36,880
using property infrastructure that is

238
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:40,479
already

239
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:42,640
available and ready to use

240
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:44,159
well the first reason is actually

241
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,680
obvious uh open

242
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:47,680
infrastructure is based on open source

243
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,319
software so it shares all the benefits

244
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,560
the business

245
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,480
practical benefits of open source

246
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,319
software and sometimes it's easy to

247
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:57,040
overlook them where we

248
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,320
probably in this crowd have been using

249
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,599
free and open source software for a

250
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,680
while and so

251
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,880
sometimes it's easy to overlook why a

252
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:05,279
business would

253
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,240
choose open source software the first

254
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,959
benefit

255
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,920
is availability the fact that there is

256
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:12,640
no barrier

257
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:14,479
monetary contractually or otherwise to

258
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:17,360
trying out the software

259
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,959
with all of its functionality the fact

260
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,120
that you can simply evaluate it for

261
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:22,399
future use play with it just have fun

262
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,800
with it

263
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:26,720
the fact that there is no friction going

264
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:30,319
from that experimentation

265
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:33,040
to production so it's really to me

266
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,800
one of the major benefits of open source

267
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,319
software but even more important

268
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,560
especially in the corporate setting is

269
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:40,880
sustainability

270
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:42,319
when an organization makes the choice of

271
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:45,120
deploying

272
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:46,560
software it does not want to be left out

273
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:49,680
without maintenance

274
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:50,000
because the vendor changes its mind or

275
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,640
goes

276
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,560
burst and so the ability for anyone to

277
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:56,000
take and modify the source code

278
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:58,239
means that you are not relying on the

279
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,760
single vendor for for long-term

280
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,920
maintenance

281
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:03,279
it also conveniently avoids finding

282
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:05,120
yourself locked in

283
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:06,560
because the cost of switching software

284
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,959
is just too high

285
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:10,479
and you end up on the vulnerable side of

286
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:13,279
the deal

287
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,920
another key benefit of open source

288
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,000
adoption

289
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:17,760
in a corporate setting is that open

290
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,240
development methodologies make it

291
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:22,240
really easy to identify and attract

292
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:24,560
talent

293
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,360
companies can identify potential

294
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,439
candidates

295
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,480
based on the open record of their

296
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,079
contribution

297
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,640
to the technologies that they're

298
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:34,880
interested in and conversely

299
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:36,640
candidates can easily identify with the

300
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:39,279
open source technologies

301
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:40,720
that organizations are using so they can

302
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:43,200
join those companies

303
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,160
with certainty that they will be able to

304
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,160
capitalize

305
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:48,399
on the experience that they will have

306
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:49,920
there it's much better than working on

307
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:53,279
proprietary software

308
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:53,760
which you are not even allowed to talk

309
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:55,600
about

310
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:59,360
and you will have no chance of

311
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:59,360
encountering ever again in your career

312
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:03,920
from a technical standpoint access to

313
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,519
the source code means that you're able

314
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:08,000
to look under hood

315
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:09,200
and understand by yourself how the

316
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,399
software works

317
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:14,480
or why it behaves the way it does this

318
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:16,480
transparency also allows you to conduct

319
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:20,160
independent security audits

320
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:20,160
for looking for vulnerabilities

321
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,880
but beyond that the ability to take and

322
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:27,199
modify the source code means that

323
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,959
you have the possibility to find and fix

324
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:32,079
issues by yourself

325
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:34,079
without even depending on a vendor this

326
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:37,359
really further increases your

327
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:40,719
ability to react fast to unexpected

328
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:42,880
failures or unexpected behaviors

329
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,480
and finally last but not least with open

330
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:46,560
source you have the possibility to

331
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,560
engage in the upstream community

332
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:50,638
producing the software

333
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:53,279
and influence its direction by

334
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:55,040
contributing directly to it

335
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:56,560
the organizations that engage in

336
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,839
upstream open source communities are

337
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,680
more efficient

338
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:01,680
they're able to anticipate changes

339
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:03,599
they're able to voice concerns when the

340
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:06,239
community is making choices that would

341
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:09,680
adversely affect them

342
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:12,160
they can make sure that the software

343
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:14,800
to their future needs by growing the

344
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:16,480
features that they will need tomorrow

345
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,000
and those are not like abstract or

346
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,720
philosophical benefits

347
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,600
those are really practical business

348
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,079
benefits

349
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,839
and the main reason why companies all

350
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:26,479
around the world today adopt open source

351
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:30,160
software

352
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:32,959
including open infrastructure

353
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:35,040
but using open source software for

354
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:37,199
providing infrastructure

355
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:38,719
also gives you three additional benefits

356
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:42,959
which we call the three c's

357
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,959
capabilities compliance and cost

358
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,880
so first capabilities

359
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,480
so back in 2010 when we started

360
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:55,839
openstack there were

361
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:59,040
people saying that there would soon be a

362
00:12:55,839 --> 00:13:01,120
standard cloud with standard size vms

363
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:03,040
and that competing against amazon web

364
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:06,399
services in providing

365
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:10,079
that service was a losing ballot

366
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:11,839
and yet 10 years after we're seeing

367
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:13,120
clouds in all forms and shapes we're

368
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:15,200
seeing um

369
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:17,440
io optimized instances we are seeing

370
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:19,440
memory optimized instances cpu optimized

371
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:22,560
instances gpus

372
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:24,639
bare metal instances so clearly one size

373
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:26,319
does not fit all

374
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:28,079
and some of those features if you want

375
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:31,200
access to a specific

376
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:32,959
feature set are really overpriced in the

377
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,000
in the public cloud market because it's

378
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:37,119
really difficult for

379
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,320
them to provide those specialized

380
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,639
resources

381
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:43,519
with the same margins as they have for

382
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:45,120
their standard size vms

383
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:46,959
and some features that you might need

384
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:49,519
are not available

385
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:51,199
so for example if you want to piece up a

386
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:52,480
specific piece of hardware within your

387
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:55,519
servers

388
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:57,440
well it's it's difficult to find it in

389
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:58,959
the public cloud if you want an atomic

390
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,800
clutch in your servers

391
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:02,560
well there's just no public cloud that

392
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:06,319
will offer you that

393
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:09,359
even if they are using it themselves

394
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:11,279
and so using

395
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:13,920
open infrastructure you can actually

396
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:16,160
decide what you put in your servers

397
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:17,760
you can have the extra flexibility the

398
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:20,079
extra extensibility the

399
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:22,720
the feature set that you want exactly in

400
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:22,719
your servers

401
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:26,880
um open infrastructure also allows full

402
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:29,199
compliance with local regulations

403
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:31,839
uh it's especially important in europe

404
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:34,479
because we have very strong privacy laws

405
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:36,000
and uh so data locality in particular is

406
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,800
very critical

407
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,240
but we are seeing that concern transfer

408
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,959
to other parties like

409
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:44,720
governments potentially being spied on

410
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:47,760
by the countries where their

411
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:51,040
public cloud resources are based

412
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:54,160
and or strategic organizations like

413
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:57,680
airbus or the atomic

414
00:14:54,160 --> 00:15:01,120
research groups which are potentially

415
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:02,959
also spied on by the same foreign spies

416
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,399
and finally we're seeing more recently

417
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:06,160
concerns from

418
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:08,399
companies that are competing with those

419
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:11,519
public cloud providers

420
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:14,240
and and running their infrastructure on

421
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:16,959
their services like netflix for example

422
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:18,560
competing with amazon prime video while

423
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:21,518
running all of their infrastructure in

424
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:21,518
amazon web services

425
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:29,439
with open infrastructure you decide who

426
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:29,440
has physical access to your servers

427
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:34,639
and finally the last c is cost so as an

428
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:38,639
infrastructure provider

429
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:38,639
if you're interested in providing

430
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,880
private infrastructure for for the needs

431
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,800
of a given organization

432
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:46,720
there are a number of of proprietary

433
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:50,000
software solutions that you can

434
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:52,399
choose but those really have

435
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,639
a high licensing cost so the cost can

436
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:55,199
add up quickly if you start using really

437
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:57,759
your

438
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:58,479
infrastructure the licensing cost really

439
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:00,160
adds up

440
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,839
and so using open source for the

441
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,439
solutions will

442
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:06,000
allow you to keep those costs under

443
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:09,040
control and if you're a company

444
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,560
interested in building a public cloud so

445
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:12,560
for anyone around the world with a

446
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:14,880
credit card

447
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:16,319
you can start from scratch there is just

448
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:18,399
no solution out there so you can

449
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,519
write something from scratch and to be

450
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:22,000
honest you will probably get to

451
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:24,959
something working really fast

452
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,720
after all like openstack nova was

453
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:28,160
written prototype over a weekend of

454
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,160
coding so it's not

455
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:32,240
rocket science like you can get to

456
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:34,560
something working really fast

457
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,360
but there is a reason why in the past

458
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:39,599
year

459
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:43,120
openstack still saw 47 000 changes

460
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:46,079
uh 10 years in it's because the devil is

461
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:48,000
in the details in all the corner cases

462
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:50,239
and so being able to rely on the

463
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,480
community sharing the same code

464
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:54,320
will save you massive amounts in

465
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:57,040
development and maintenance costs

466
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,040
over the long run

467
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,959
so those species are yet another reason

468
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,639
why you should adopt open infrastructure

469
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:05,879
but now i want to talk about

470
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:08,160
how open infrastructure facilitates uh

471
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:09,919
interoperability and hybrid cloud

472
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:12,160
scenarios

473
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:15,760
so at that point you may wonder hybrid

474
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:19,679
cloud like isn't that a buzzword from

475
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:21,599
industry um well yes and no

476
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:23,760
the traditional thinking behind choosing

477
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:26,719
between public and private cloud

478
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,720
goes a bit like this

479
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:31,360
so if you look at the price profile of a

480
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:34,880
public cloud

481
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:36,000
and you graph the cost of your cloud per

482
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,840
cpu core

483
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,919
with public cloud it looks a bit like

484
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,959
this you pay a certain price per cpu

485
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:42,480
core

486
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,559
until you hit the number of calls and

487
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:47,360
then you hit new pricing tier and price

488
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:48,160
goes down a bit etc etc until you hit

489
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,320
the final

490
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,440
pricing tier and you pay that's the

491
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:54,720
price you will pay for

492
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:55,600
uni extra units forever the price

493
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:57,520
profile for

494
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:59,360
private cloud on the other hand looks a

495
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:02,000
bit like this you have this

496
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:03,199
high investment upfront then you hit

497
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,640
economies of scale

498
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:08,400
and at some point you need

499
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,240
the point of diminishing return so it

500
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:13,039
just goes

501
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:14,160
like this at the end and so the choice

502
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:15,679
between public and private

503
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:18,480
infrastructure looks simple like

504
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:20,720
above a certain number of core makes

505
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,200
more sense to use private infrastructure

506
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,200
while

507
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,240
under a number of cores it makes more

508
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,960
sense to use

509
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:29,039
public infrastructure but in reality

510
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:31,360
things are a bit more complex

511
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:33,120
because this assumes that your the

512
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:36,320
amount of resources you consume

513
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:37,520
is the constant over time and in reality

514
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:39,600
your usage

515
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:41,600
probably looks more like this like with

516
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:43,678
spikes and drops in usage

517
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:46,000
so what really makes the most sense

518
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:48,160
economically is actually to use

519
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,559
private infrastructure for those

520
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:53,200
resources that you're always using

521
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:54,399
and use public infrastructure elasticity

522
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:57,200
to

523
00:18:54,400 --> 00:19:00,480
absorb the spikes in usage which is what

524
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,480
is called hybrid usage

525
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:05,678
and open infrastructure is really great

526
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:07,919
for those hybrid scenarios because you

527
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:08,640
can use the same software on the private

528
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:11,039
side

529
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:13,120
and on the public side that allows you

530
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:15,039
to optimize cost because

531
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:16,719
you can use private infrastructure for

532
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:17,919
all those resources that you're always

533
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,520
using

534
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:21,440
and you can use public infrastructure

535
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:23,120
for those spikes but it also enables

536
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:25,120
capabilities and compliance

537
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,559
because if you need specific hardware

538
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:30,320
for specific

539
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:32,639
workloads or or you have data locality

540
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:34,559
requirements you can run those on the

541
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:38,240
private side of your infrastructure

542
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:40,320
while still using public cloud

543
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:41,280
and using the same software and apis on

544
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:44,159
the private

545
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:45,520
and the public side allows you to reduce

546
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,480
applications costs because you don't

547
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:48,480
have to validate

548
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,840
separate versions of your applications

549
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:52,160
based on where they're running

550
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:53,840
allows you to move applications around

551
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:56,799
from the private to the public side of

552
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:58,959
your infrastructure and vice versa

553
00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:01,360
examples of open source software that

554
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:03,919
provide that kind of interoperability

555
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:06,000
include openstack which provides

556
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:09,280
interoperability at the infrastructure

557
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,880
as a as a service layer so you can find

558
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:12,639
private clouds running openstack and

559
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:14,640
public clouds running open stack

560
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:16,559
but also kubernetes which provides

561
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:18,400
promises interoperability at the

562
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:20,480
application deployment layer

563
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,760
so any cloud that provides kubernetes

564
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:25,360
gives you

565
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:27,520
gives you some interoperability there

566
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:28,479
so open infrastructure is pretty great

567
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:32,320
obviously

568
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:37,360
i'm trying to make a case for it but it

569
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:39,520
also makes sense for tomorrow and

570
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:41,439
what do i mean by open infrastructure is

571
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:43,120
future proof

572
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,640
well obviously it's hard to know what

573
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:46,000
the future holds i i

574
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:48,320
certainly don't know that but we're

575
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,240
pretty sure of a few things we

576
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:52,320
are pretty sure that abstractions will

577
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:54,559
continue to be piled

578
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,439
we've gone from virtualization to cloud

579
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:58,000
apis

580
00:20:55,440 --> 00:21:00,960
to application deployment apis this is

581
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,960
clearly not over

582
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:05,199
we're also pretty sure that there is no

583
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:07,280
technology that will end all

584
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:10,320
technologies

585
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:12,320
we are using vms we're using containers

586
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:13,918
we are now using functions

587
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:16,240
and there is no reason to think that

588
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:18,559
containers somehow is the end

589
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:21,120
to all things there will be new things

590
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:22,799
invented tomorrow

591
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:24,879
and we're also pretty sure that we'll

592
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:25,280
need to provide infrastructure for those

593
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:28,080
new

594
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:30,000
those new technologies infrastructure

595
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:32,158
will always have to be provided

596
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,679
applications will always have to run

597
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:37,520
somewhere

598
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:39,679
i mean even serverless servers

599
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:41,280
and in that uncertain future open

600
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:43,200
infrastructure can help because with

601
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:45,760
open source

602
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:48,559
you invest in communities you don't

603
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:51,919
invest in products

604
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:54,080
and those communities tackle a problem

605
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:56,159
space they are not

606
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:57,600
only producing a specific narrow

607
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:59,360
solution

608
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:01,039
so for example the the openstack

609
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:04,399
community is not

610
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:05,840
about producing openstack it's about

611
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,760
taking the perspective of the

612
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:09,678
infrastructure provider

613
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:11,679
and helping them build and operate open

614
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:12,000
infrastructure if we need to create

615
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:14,080
other

616
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,039
pieces of technology other open source

617
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:17,520
projects

618
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:18,960
like if that community needs those to

619
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:21,200
provide open infrastructure

620
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:23,200
then they will be able to do it so

621
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:26,000
investing in that community lets you

622
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:28,480
share issues and other infrastructure

623
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,960
with other infrastructure providers

624
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:33,919
and build solutions for tomorrow

625
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,919
whatever you need there

626
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:44,399
so to summarize

627
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:46,080
that's really fast so to summarize

628
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:48,000
we've seen several reasons why as an

629
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:50,000
infrastructure provider you should adopt

630
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,120
open infrastructure some of them are

631
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,679
like rooted

632
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:55,199
good business reasons based on the fact

633
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:57,440
that it's open source

634
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:59,039
uh some of them are more specific to

635
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:02,080
open infrastructure like

636
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:02,799
capabilities compliance and cost we've

637
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:05,840
seen how it

638
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:06,879
enables interoperability and hybrid

639
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,639
cloud usage

640
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:12,000
we've seen how it better prepares you

641
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:15,120
for whatever is coming up tomorrow

642
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,320
but there is really a deeper reason

643
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:18,719
why you should choose open

644
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:22,639
infrastructure and it's that

645
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:24,400
open infrastructure enables innovation

646
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:27,039
i mean i love open infrastructure

647
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:29,760
because i don't want a world where

648
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:33,760
all of the infrastructure needs will be

649
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:33,760
provided by a couple of internet giants

650
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:40,480
or worse by a monopoly

651
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,279
why well first monopolies are bad i'm

652
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,679
pretty sure

653
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:45,200
that's something people can agree with

654
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:45,919
they really distort good market

655
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,720
conditions

656
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:50,720
in the end they limit innovation and the

657
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:53,679
prices go up so having

658
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:54,720
concentration of cloud of infrastructure

659
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:56,320
providing in a

660
00:23:54,720 --> 00:24:00,159
couple of big shops really creates a

661
00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:00,158
problem it's not really sane

662
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:04,799
but what's even less sane and i would

663
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:07,918
say borderline dangerous

664
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:09,600
is monocultures monocultures are

665
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:12,159
vulnerable

666
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:14,158
so if half of the internet is running

667
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:17,120
off a single

668
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:18,720
infrastructure provider then it's not

669
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:20,959
resilient at all

670
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:23,760
a single class break can lead to

671
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:25,520
catastrophic failure

672
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,960
and what used to be mildly annoying

673
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:30,240
because you could not check your

674
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:31,520
facebook feed anymore with more and more

675
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:33,440
devices

676
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:35,520
being connected to the internet and

677
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:37,600
relying on the internet to function

678
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:39,918
what used to be mildly annoying can now

679
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:41,760
be life-threatening

680
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:43,520
so it's really important that we have

681
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:47,039
diversity

682
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:50,639
to avoid monopolies and monocultures

683
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:53,679
but beyond that giving everyone access

684
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:56,799
to infrastructure providing technologies

685
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:58,640
allows everyone to play and innovate

686
00:24:56,799 --> 00:25:00,720
if you restrict innovation to a couple

687
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:03,760
of big shops

688
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:04,159
you're limiting what the world can do so

689
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,240
it's

690
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:07,919
important that we have strong open

691
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,200
source infrastructure providing

692
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:12,559
solutions

693
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:14,000
available for everyone it allows us to

694
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:17,600
distribute the future more

695
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:20,799
evenly and that to me is really why

696
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:22,959
open infrastructure really matters and

697
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:29,840
why i would like you to adopt more of it

698
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:29,840
tomorrow thank you for your attention

699
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:38,000
[Applause]

700
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,559
it's like 30 minutes for questions now

701
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:43,840
so

702
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:43,840
does anyone want to ask any questions

703
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:14,080
i saw you guys

704
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:16,799
thank you for the wonderful presentation

705
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:19,678
uh i have just one quick question what

706
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:22,240
are we doing to address barrier of entry

707
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:22,880
so take a little example i work for

708
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:25,600
startup

709
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:26,559
we need to spin up infrastructure today

710
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:29,279
and fast

711
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:31,039
i can do it in amazon in two or three

712
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:33,120
days

713
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:35,120
but i care about open source we care

714
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:36,719
about freedom and not being vendored

715
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:38,959
locked in

716
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:42,320
what would be the way to do the same

717
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:42,320
with say openstack

718
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:46,080
so you can you can opt for a public

719
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:49,120
cloud

720
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:49,760
sorry you can opt for a public cloud

721
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:52,080
that is

722
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:53,360
actually based on openstack we have a

723
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:55,279
number of public clouds

724
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:57,039
uh in europe in particular it's

725
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:59,039
difficult to make a dent on the public

726
00:26:57,039 --> 00:26:59,520
cloud market in the us right now because

727
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:02,640
it's

728
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:05,520
it's really a cutthroat between amazon

729
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:07,760
and microsoft and google but

730
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:10,080
in the european market there is really a

731
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:11,279
strong footprint of openstack based

732
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:13,520
public clouds

733
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:15,120
uh because we have unique concerns in

734
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:18,080
terms of data locality

735
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:19,840
and regulations so it's pretty

736
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:22,000
attractive

737
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:23,120
we have like an ecosystem of companies

738
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,200
and not like

739
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:26,239
name any of them because that would be

740
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:30,960
from getting one of them

741
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:34,320
and making enemies but you have options

742
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:36,640
you have options that will

743
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:38,559
let you benefit from the fact that it's

744
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:41,360
ready to use i'm not saying you should

745
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:42,960
do private clouds i'm saying you should

746
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:46,080
take into account the fact that

747
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:47,919
at one point you might reach a level of

748
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:49,120
optimization where it might make more

749
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:50,720
financial sense

750
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:52,399
to start setting up your own

751
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:55,200
infrastructure

752
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:57,120
especially once you have the your needs

753
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,960
start stabilized

754
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:00,320
it's easier to know how much you

755
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:03,600
actually would benefit

756
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:04,399
from implementing some of it in a local

757
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:07,039
private

758
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:08,879
infrastructure but you can prepare for

759
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:11,919
that future by opting for

760
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:12,480
uh openstack based public clouds uh in

761
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:17,840
your

762
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:17,840
in we have a marketplace thanks

763
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:22,970
are there any other questions

764
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:22,969
[Music]

765
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:33,200
okay thank you very much for your talk

766
00:28:29,970 --> 00:28:33,200
[Applause]
