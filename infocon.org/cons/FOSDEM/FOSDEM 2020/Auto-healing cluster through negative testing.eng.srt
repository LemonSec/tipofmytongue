1
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,719
all right

2
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:15,200
um hey guys um i'm rajat and uh

3
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:16,480
i work out of red hat and we we do lots

4
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,279
of open source stuff

5
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,720
and uh before we begin um so this is

6
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:22,240
where you guys can find me this is my

7
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:25,439
github and linkedin so

8
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:26,959
hit me up all right so

9
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:28,800
today we are going to talk about auto

10
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,080
healing clusters and negative testing so

11
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,640
before we begin um

12
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:33,600
i wanted to know like a show of hands if

13
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,680
anyone does

14
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,520
any kind of negative testing ever done

15
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,719
like have you guys ever done any kind of

16
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,840
negative testing

17
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:44,000
oh great all right all right

18
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:46,719
so before we talk about negative testing

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,640
we'll talk about auto healing clusters

20
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:50,320
so what is an auto healing cluster so

21
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,760
basically it's a kind of cluster which

22
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,360
basically monitor itself

23
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,039
and whenever there is a degradation of a

24
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,079
cluster you know it will start a

25
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:58,239
recovery process so

26
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:59,760
it will make always make sure keep i

27
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:01,680
mean it will always make sure that

28
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,039
there is no kind of degradation happens

29
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:06,400
in a cluster

30
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:09,200
all right so now let's jump into

31
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,000
testing so i mean this is what society

32
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,119
thinks about

33
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,799
people doing testing so

34
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:16,560
all right so in particular we'll talk

35
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:18,560
about uh negative testing

36
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,759
and how it works so these are some very

37
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,799
basic examples

38
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:26,159
for negative testing so

39
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:28,320
so basically what negative testing is

40
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,840
your system or your application or your

41
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,639
cluster should be

42
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,240
ready to uh handle gracefully all the

43
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,640
unexpected situations

44
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,679
so we'll jump back uh as you can see is

45
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,520
that uh

46
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,200
these are unexpected situation i mean

47
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:44,640
these are not the desired

48
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:47,119
input that our application wants so

49
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,799
if a user or somebody enters these kind

50
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:50,399
of input

51
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,880
our system should be able to handle

52
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:56,079
these type of situations gracefully

53
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,960
so we'll look into more complex example

54
00:01:56,079 --> 00:02:00,158
and more practical

55
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,719
later in the slides all right so why do

56
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:02,240
we need

57
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:04,320
negative testing in open shift or

58
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,839
kubernetes as we say is to

59
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,679
obviously to detect unexpected

60
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,280
conditions and

61
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,360
if we'll cover all the unexpected

62
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,160
conditions we'll all will also prevent

63
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,520
it from

64
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:16,160
will also prevent the cluster from

65
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:18,239
crashing so

66
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,239
okay so before we jump into practical

67
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:22,879
scenarios i just wanted to

68
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:24,879
okay i just wanted you guys to see this

69
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:27,120
so this is the cluster

70
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:28,640
and uh this is the master node the

71
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,040
kubernetes master node

72
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:33,200
and these are the worker nodes so weekly

73
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:36,319
basically worker nodes are the one

74
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,119
where you deploy your workload so as you

75
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:40,480
can see these are

76
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,280
osds so oz stands for object storage

77
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,440
devices and

78
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,440
short term in short you can say that

79
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,920
these are these are the devices or the

80
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,160
disks

81
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,958
which are used to store data so you can

82
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:52,319
call them

83
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:54,879
you know like normal disk storing data

84
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:56,319
then you have the mon so basically mon

85
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:59,840
or monitor as we call

86
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:02,159
so this is used to watch over these osds

87
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,120
so if there is any problem with the osds

88
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:05,120
i mean say

89
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,280
euros is not working fine or you are

90
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,959
stuck somewhere while working with osds

91
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,480
you can always look into the mon you can

92
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:12,480
check the locks for the monitors

93
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,480
and you will have all your answers and

94
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,560
these are the rgw

95
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:18,480
all right uh i also don't know because i

96
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:21,680
don't work with rgws sorry

97
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:23,518
what this means so anyways um and these

98
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,599
are the uh rook agent or the rooks have

99
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:29,920
discovered these are the operators

100
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:32,000
so in the entire in the i'm sorry

101
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,958
in this entire worker node if there is

102
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,360
any kind of

103
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,879
problem like uh if you want to have an

104
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,879
overview of what's happening actually

105
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:40,798
you can always look into these spots

106
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:43,040
you can check uh the logs for these

107
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:45,680
spots and you will have your answers

108
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:47,200
so now let's jump back so these are the

109
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,400
practical scenarios i was talking about

110
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,280
where you can perform your negative

111
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,440
testing

112
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,640
so first is what if the cluster gets

113
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,439
disconnected from the network

114
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,000
accidentally when

115
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:57,599
i was happening okay so an input and

116
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
output is happening and

117
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:01,679
okay so suppose you are on this node you

118
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,760
are having one input and output

119
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,200
and what's let's just say your network

120
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,679
you got disconnected with the public

121
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,480
network

122
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:10,159
all right so what will happen so you

123
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,720
know you can always uh

124
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:13,519
you know uh test this scenario by

125
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,840
yourself

126
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,720
and you can have the uh you know output

127
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,040
and you can check

128
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,239
if you already wrote any kind of

129
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:24,160
solution for it

130
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:24,159
what i mean to say is that um

131
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,960
what i mean to say is that uh i mean i'm

132
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,520
sorry i forgot

133
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,799
all right i mean all right the next uh

134
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,880
scenario is what happens

135
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,800
if my cluster uh what happens to a

136
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:39,120
cluster if a node shutdown so

137
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,479
say if my entire nodes got shut down so

138
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,960
what will happen what will happen to the

139
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:42,320
data

140
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,560
what will happen to the monitors what

141
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:46,479
will happen to anything so these are the

142
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,919
uh scenarios that you can uh you know

143
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:50,639
perform and check

144
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:52,400
if you have the uh corner cases written

145
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:55,040
for these kind of situations

146
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:57,280
then then it's good but if it's not uh

147
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:59,199
you need to write it

148
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,880
so what are we testing today we are

149
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:02,320
going to test the disconnection of the

150
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,240
cluster from the public network

151
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:06,240
again we are going to disconnect one

152
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,639
cluster from the

153
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,000
public network and second is detaching

154
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:11,680
the disks

155
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,120
from a running mod so as i told you

156
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,280
these are the monitors

157
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,720
and there is a disk attached to it where

158
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:19,039
this monitor runs

159
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:21,280
so so we are going to detach that and

160
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:24,560
see the outcome

161
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:28,080
so i mean i'm sorry

162
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,080
yeah can you see it all right

163
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:35,758
so here as it starts all right

164
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:37,280
so this is the command to detach a disk

165
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:39,120
from a monitor so this is the

166
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:41,198
name of the vm i mean the virtual

167
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,000
machine where the my monitor is running

168
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:43,919
or my node

169
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,280
where my monitor is running this is the

170
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:53,440
name of that image

171
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:56,960
and then i'll just disconnect it

172
00:05:53,440 --> 00:06:06,880
all right um so all right so

173
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:07,758
disc is i mean so now the disk is

174
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,360
detached

175
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:11,680
now we'll check the output of what is

176
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,680
happening

177
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,000
so i want

178
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:20,800
yeah so this is the you can say it's

179
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,560
kind of a dashboard where you can see

180
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,479
the entire health of your cluster

181
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,800
so right now i'm running a safe cluster

182
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:28,400
so i can check the entire cluster so

183
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,160
right now there is no problem with the

184
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,039
with my clusters at all because health

185
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:34,639
is okay

186
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:36,240
um all my demons are up my osd as i told

187
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:37,759
you my storage devices all are working

188
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,000
since very fine

189
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:40,000
so

190
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:47,919
all right so as you can see as i just

191
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,960
detached my monitor

192
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:53,840
disk from my monitor my monitor got into

193
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,840
error status

194
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:01,360
all right i mean i was just highlighting

195
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,359
it so

196
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:06,880
and now as you can see the uh like the

197
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:07,440
status of my except cluster has been

198
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:10,159
changed

199
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,800
it says that one of one by three monitor

200
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,800
is down

201
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,400
so that means when i negative tested it

202
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,720
there was already a solution written for

203
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,318
it

204
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:19,520
so that means you have already verified

205
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:22,160
it you're okay you know that um

206
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:23,520
my cluster will work fine if it will get

207
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:27,280
into a situation like this

208
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,280
so you need not to worry about it now

209
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:34,080
just a second and yeah and there it goes

210
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,199
i'm sorry yeah so as you can see it

211
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,960
start it's

212
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:42,720
it's changed its status from error to

213
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,758
crash loop back off so that means it's

214
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,319
kind of a loop

215
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:48,639
so what i mean to say is that uh it

216
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:50,560
started a auto healing process so it is

217
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:52,319
constantly running in a loop and it is

218
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,240
trying to find the disc if it is there

219
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:56,479
or not it's just re-verifying it

220
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,319
but it's not finding it's like my

221
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:59,199
monitor is not able to find the attached

222
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,759
disk

223
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:03,759
so that is why into it was it's just

224
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:04,800
running into a loop to find it again and

225
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:06,960
again

226
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,960
so

227
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,160
so now what i'll do i'll attach the disk

228
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:18,400
again so

229
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,400
here the command is all right

230
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:25,759
i mean yeah so

231
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,599
i think the player is there so that is

232
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:29,199
why you aren't able to see it but

233
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:30,960
yeah so if you can see the command right

234
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:32,719
now this is the command to attach the

235
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:35,838
disk back again to the monitor

236
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:37,440
now we'll uh check the

237
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:40,880
watch the status again so right now the

238
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:43,519
health is still in the warning phase

239
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:45,279
now we got a new error for a container

240
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:47,680
creating configuration so

241
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:48,640
even if the disk is attached still we

242
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:52,319
are not able to

243
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:54,959
uh get the monitors running again

244
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,440
so this is the problem like uh so now

245
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:57,279
you can

246
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,040
you have an output now you can report

247
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:00,560
this back to developers or

248
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,319
you can write a code for this by

249
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,399
yourself is that uh

250
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,360
whenever you attach a disk uh the

251
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:07,120
cluster should be

252
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,120
up and running again and again but that

253
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:11,839
doesn't work so

254
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,160
now i have to manually delete the pod

255
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:14,320
and

256
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,319
uh

257
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,160
so people who are familiar with

258
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:23,519
kubernetes uh it's a concept i mean

259
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:26,399
you guys must be knowing is that it's a

260
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:29,040
concept for a replication controller

261
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:30,880
uh is that whenever you delete a pod uh

262
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,399
the pod will again come back up

263
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,240
so that is gonna happen that is what is

264
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:35,120
gonna happen we have i've deleted the

265
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:51,120
pod and

266
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:54,720
the pod will come back again

267
00:09:51,120 --> 00:10:05,839
i'm checking the pot status again so

268
00:09:54,720 --> 00:10:05,839
yep so as you can see all right

269
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,519
okay again the player is there so you

270
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,839
cannot see it but

271
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:13,680
this is the mon uh which was in the

272
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:16,160
pending or in the area state

273
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:17,599
but since it's the player is here so you

274
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:20,000
are not able to see the oh okay

275
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,920
good i mean so as you can see it got

276
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:25,519
into the running phase again when

277
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:28,319
when we deleted the pod so

278
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:29,360
so this was uh one thing this is the one

279
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:33,839
testing that i did

280
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:33,839
is detaching the mon now we'll look into

281
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:42,800
now i'm sorry yeah so now we'll uh

282
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,399
look into disconnection of a cluster

283
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,279
from the public network so what we're

284
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:48,320
gonna do is that

285
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:49,600
we are going to uh disconnect one entire

286
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:52,560
node from the

287
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:54,320
cluster by shutting down its public

288
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:57,760
interface public network interface

289
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,760
so let's see what happens

290
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,599
all right so this is the node and this

291
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,800
is the ip

292
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:08,240
and now we're gonna get the uh

293
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:10,479
we are we first search into the node

294
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,519
and now we are gonna get the public

295
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:15,839
network interface

296
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:15,839
for this node

297
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:29,839
okay

298
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,360
all right so this is the command that

299
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:37,120
i'm typing for is to

300
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,800
shut down the public network interface

301
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,440
so once the public network interface is

302
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,920
down

303
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,560
nobody should be able to access into the

304
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:45,040
node

305
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:46,640
so this is what uh i was expecting

306
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:49,519
before uh testing it

307
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:51,519
so now let's see the result if if if if

308
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:54,839
it's behaving like the way it was coded

309
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:56,959
it's fine but if it's not then that's a

310
00:11:54,839 --> 00:12:01,440
problem

311
00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:03,119
yeah so i shut it down now let's see the

312
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:11,839
outcome if i'm able to stage into the

313
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:11,839
nodes or not

314
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:18,560
okay still there is no response so that

315
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:21,279
is a good thing is that uh

316
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:22,880
you know once you have shut down the uh

317
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:25,360
once you have shut down one node

318
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:26,720
uh it's not able to give back any kind

319
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,800
of information

320
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,079
so that's why it's into the you know

321
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,240
there is no further

322
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:35,519
command or it's this command is not

323
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,519
getting completed

324
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:41,440
so now here i'm going to try it uh i'm

325
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:43,920
going to try to search into the

326
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:46,880
same node again with the same ip and as

327
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:48,959
you can see i got a warning that uh

328
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:50,720
something nasty it's possible that

329
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:53,199
someone's doing something nasty

330
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:55,040
and i'm not able to search into the node

331
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,880
so that verifies this thing is that

332
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,079
once my public interface network

333
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:03,080
interface is down

334
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:04,839
nobody is able to access it so

335
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:07,839
[Music]

336
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:07,839
yep

337
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:12,000
all right uh just to verify again uh

338
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,600
this is the part that was running on the

339
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,720
node that i just shut down

340
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:21,839
and let us just try to sh into this

341
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:21,839
pod and let's see if this happens or not

342
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,800
yeah and again i was not able to switch

343
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:30,000
into the

344
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:33,120
pod because the node that was

345
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,720
i mean the pod on which this i mean the

346
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:38,000
node on which this port was running

347
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:41,199
that is already shut down so it is

348
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,199
happening as expected so

349
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,880
yeah so that is how i negative tested

350
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:47,040
these

351
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,639
that is our negative testers these two

352
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:51,680
scenarios

353
00:13:48,639 --> 00:14:03,839
and yeah that concludes it and if you

354
00:13:51,680 --> 00:14:03,839
have any questions so one

355
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:19,760
do we have any ideas yeah suggestions

356
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:30,560
how can we apply this technique for

357
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:33,120
negative testing self-healing um yeah so

358
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:34,638
firstly you need to have some kind of

359
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,800
unexpected situations

360
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:37,760
figure out already which don't happen

361
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:40,959
very often

362
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:42,399
and then uh you can you can uh automate

363
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:45,839
things if you want or

364
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:45,839
you can negative test it so

365
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:49,390
[Music]

366
00:14:54,800 --> 00:15:01,439
yeah so

367
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:04,800
when you inject your your failure

368
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:08,079
the one component detects them

369
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:10,479
and something triggers a reaction

370
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:11,199
sorry and something in the cluster

371
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:14,480
triggers

372
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:16,000
reactive to the defender i'm sorry can

373
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:19,120
you come again with the question

374
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:22,720
so let me see if i understood

375
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:27,839
yeah sure yeah failure

376
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:27,839
yes explicitly

377
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:40,959
but when the failure is

378
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,959
to

379
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:57,120
sorry all right so

380
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:59,360
the thing that he was asking if i

381
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:02,480
understood correctly is that uh

382
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:03,440
if my mom was shut down and uh if there

383
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,600
is some kind of

384
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:07,440
permanent uh cluster damage happens then

385
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,839
what ones do right

386
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,839
yeah so

387
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:16,470
[Music]

388
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:37,839
thank you very much

389
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:51,839
yes

390
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,800
and then it will be recorded and

391
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:05,040
published automatically we will receive

392
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,040
another

393
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:19,520
[Music]

394
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:33,840
okay so we have

395
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:33,840
we have some presents for speakers

396
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:49,039
yes just put it like here

397
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:51,520
well yeah here is good yes yeah it's

398
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:51,520
perfect

399
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:56,000
somewhere in your belt or your pocket

400
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:15,840
actually i'll bring over a chair for

401
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:15,840
some of it

402
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:36,160
um okay maybe i can i put my laptop over

403
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:39,120
here somehow

404
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:39,120
no not really i guess

405
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:45,440
10 minutes i guess we'll start right on

406
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,440
time right yes

407
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,918
you can try

408
00:18:56,950 --> 00:19:00,960
[Music]

409
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:02,959
but what will happen if i accidentally

410
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:06,000
hit any of these buttons

411
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:06,400
these are lights you cannot fit them so

412
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:11,840
hard

413
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:11,840
that they do something bad

414
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:22,799
i think maybe i'll just be standing

415
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,799
or

416
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:39,840
i'll just try to do it standing it's

417
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:39,840
just gonna be some typing

418
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:52,240
yeah so when you have a question or

419
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,280
discussion repeat or summarize for the

420
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,799
people who are watching

421
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:57,440
the live stream yeah and for the

422
00:19:54,799 --> 00:20:01,039
recording speak louder

423
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:03,120
if you can yeah i think i tend to

424
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:04,158
speak pretty loud at these things so i'm

425
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:07,600
just afraid that

426
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:10,640
i kind of blessed these guys

427
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:12,959
on the camera ah okay

428
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,960
great

429
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:17,200
it's the first time i tried to do this i

430
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,840
mean

431
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,799
basically in a very long time so it's

432
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:21,918
like

433
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:23,840
i think first time it's just like a

434
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:25,280
really cool conference you know but it's

435
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:27,199
also very casual like

436
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,399
i signed up for this thing and i just

437
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,480
walk in here on the day

438
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:32,559
and then i didn't know if there was

439
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:35,039
somewhere i had to go and

440
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:36,480
sign up or something like that didn't

441
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:39,360
you receive like an email with

442
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:40,880
instructions for the faq on the website

443
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:43,520
yeah let's try to find some information

444
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:49,360
but i don't know

445
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:51,200
we should do it yeah yeah speakers yes

446
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:53,360
yeah because i looked in the like on the

447
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:55,039
first plane with it for like

448
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:56,559
if there was some notes for speakers or

449
00:20:55,039 --> 00:21:00,158
something like that but it's not like

450
00:20:56,559 --> 00:21:01,760
really it's like you know five sentences

451
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:03,600
true but you can send it to being

452
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:05,919
recorded everything is creative commons

453
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,918
that's it

454
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:17,840

yeah but i thought we started 14 25 we
