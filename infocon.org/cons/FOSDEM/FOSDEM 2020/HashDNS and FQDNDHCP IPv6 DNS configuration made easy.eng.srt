1
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:15,090
that I cannot there is virtual square is

2
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:18,900
a team of developers studying the

3
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:21,900
frontiers of your quality I indeed the

4
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:25,859
group / the group was created in Bologna

5
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:32,668
I don't know 16 17 years ago we have

6
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:35,040
done several several projects our most

7
00:00:32,668 --> 00:00:37,769
famous processes mediator distributed

8
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:41,040
the internet which is virtually eaten is

9
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:45,240
supported by many virtual machines like

10
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:48,860
avian came over / boxer or a user not

11
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:51,450
Linux today I am talking about

12
00:00:48,860 --> 00:01:01,050
Hokkien as a fully qualified domain name

13
00:00:51,450 --> 00:01:04,229
the ACP we are dealing with Internet of

14
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:06,929
threads so our idea is that it's

15
00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:09,390
anachronistic to give IP addresses just

16
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:12,329
to interfaces or machine

17
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:19,909
maybe it's process in the future can

18
00:01:12,329 --> 00:01:25,559
have its own IP address we need strikes

19
00:01:19,909 --> 00:01:29,850
networking structure as libraries and we

20
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:33,359
need the ipv6 because given that we want

21
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:37,460
address it's a process so we need a

22
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:42,990
great number of IP addresses available

23
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:46,579
which is the problem with ipv6 from one

24
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:50,990
sided that you have to write down

25
00:01:46,579 --> 00:01:56,428
128-bit each time you want to write in a

26
00:01:50,990 --> 00:02:01,649
an address it means I think 32 X or

27
00:01:56,429 --> 00:02:06,689
decimal digits so it's a procedure very

28
00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:11,569
prone to error yeah and the second is

29
00:02:06,689 --> 00:02:16,319
that you have to deal with DNS

30
00:02:11,569 --> 00:02:18,170
addressing this kind of nonsense so they

31
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:26,390
I think

32
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:30,950
the dream that a maintainer is that man

33
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:36,440
working with DNS a dream that this kind

34
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:41,269
of person has is to be able to to add

35
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:43,730
and you know just by writing those two

36
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:46,489
lines over there so I created this

37
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:49,579
seminar in a circular way first of all I

38
00:02:46,489 --> 00:02:52,280
wanna show you which is the goal of the

39
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:55,430
topic of this seminar and then we are

40
00:02:52,280 --> 00:03:00,319
going to see how to achieve that goal so

41
00:02:55,430 --> 00:03:04,819
I want to add to the interface that

42
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:12,260
their interface file in it it is the

43
00:03:04,819 --> 00:03:14,988
network just those two lines efface here

44
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:18,760
the the top tier is just an example the

45
00:03:14,989 --> 00:03:23,239
interfaces you wanna give an address and

46
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:27,858
got the name and everything must be

47
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:31,130
configured in an automatical way we want

48
00:03:27,859 --> 00:03:35,180
is to configure the actual ipv6 address

49
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:38,530
of the machine the dns for the for the

50
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:44,930
direct and the DNS for the reverse

51
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:49,040
resolution how can it be done why

52
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:52,030
because ipv6 adoption ensures that not

53
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:56,420
only for our Internet of triodes

54
00:03:52,030 --> 00:04:00,530
processes or virtual machines but even

55
00:03:56,420 --> 00:04:06,488
for real machines in late November last

56
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:12,910
late November ripe in year who emitted a

57
00:04:06,489 --> 00:04:23,770
warning saying that they ran out of ipv4

58
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:32,210
Nats the first idea is to use the ACP so

59
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:38,190
for in ipv6 terminology stateful Auto

60
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:41,370
configuration there is an NFS c-47a -

61
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:44,190
that says that the queries can include a

62
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:48,260
fully qualified domain name but this

63
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:48,260
fully qualified domain name is usually

64
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:59,100
in order to update the DNS once the ipv6

65
00:04:55,110 --> 00:05:04,700
has been calculated by the DHCP server

66
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:08,930
so the DHCP is responsible for

67
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:12,030
generating the ipv6 address and then

68
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:16,830
that fully qualified domain name is used

69
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:23,099
to push the pair name addressed to the

70
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:29,520
DNS we have extended the idea of this of

71
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:33,690
this field of this option when the DHCP

72
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:38,120
server gets a query including a fully

73
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:41,460
qualified domain name it asks the DNS

74
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:46,770
which is the IP address for that name

75
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:49,229
and the answer from the DNS is used to

76
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:56,280
create the actual ipv6 address to the

77
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:59,970
node okay so you can just give the name

78
00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:03,469
and provided the DNS is able to give an

79
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:08,370
address to that name the game is

80
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:15,740
completely closed so we have achieved

81
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:19,980
this result but there is another point

82
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:23,310
there is the standard way that this how

83
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:31,080
fully qualified Romanian DHCP works the

84
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:35,610
client ask make it makes a query but

85
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:38,700
instead of the DHCP returning address it

86
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:43,460
asks for the DNS server for the name

87
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:45,590
resolution the second row is the same

88
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:48,229
set of act

89
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:51,859
but in order not to put too many errors

90
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:55,760
that they are repeated so the the answer

91
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:59,590
path is from the DNS server the IP

92
00:06:55,760 --> 00:07:03,590
address that is forwarded to the client

93
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:06,320
but this is not enough because in this

94
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:08,599
way you can give the name of the holster

95
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:12,409
you can use the two lines but you have

96
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:15,889
to configure your DNS server in order to

97
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:22,960
write your address so we need a second

98
00:07:15,889 --> 00:07:29,150
idea hash based ipv6 addresses so

99
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:34,849
instead of having long and boring tables

100
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:38,659
in the DNS server we generate the low 64

101
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:46,760
bits of the ipv6 address as a hash of

102
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:55,550
the name so given the prefix of that

103
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:59,750
network you can just catenate the prefix

104
00:07:55,550 --> 00:08:06,080
and a tail which is computed as in hash

105
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:08,360
out of the name and you have a serve in

106
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:14,859
an empty v6 address it means that this

107
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:18,740
kind of DNS server if it has been

108
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:25,250
created for roam my Corp or kia is able

109
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:35,060
to resolve any name and in Rome my Corp

110
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:39,740
of the torque may be okay maybe the the

111
00:08:35,059 --> 00:08:43,599
IP that the DNS server generates an IP

112
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:47,150
address which belongs to no one

113
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:50,930
so you have a DNS server which is able

114
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:57,130
to translate anything that answer in a

115
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:57,130
dot on my Corp order so

116
00:08:57,340 --> 00:09:07,490
Danya is that now we have to say to the

117
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:11,900
DNS server the prefix we have reduced

118
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:15,520
the complexity of the problem but still

119
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:21,110
we have to provide the the DNS server

120
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:24,829
this DNS server with the prefix actually

121
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:28,310
the DNS that the preface can be computed

122
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:32,840
by it in a DNS server itself so let us

123
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:35,170
see step by step how the process the

124
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:38,180
resolution process has been carried out

125
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:41,750
a-crying somewhere in the world wanna

126
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:45,800
talk with w cuba hash my name archaea

127
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:50,440
and it it asks to the closest to the NS

128
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:54,290
a-- the resolution so there is the the

129
00:09:50,440 --> 00:10:01,370
the recursion of a name server at the

130
00:09:54,290 --> 00:10:04,459
end the query the query reaches the DNS

131
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:07,160
server of my domain to torture my there

132
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:12,230
is an error obviously it was my name the

133
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:14,630
target my name the torture the the the

134
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:18,170
main server which is assigned or bind

135
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:25,730
server for world today because there is

136
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:30,979
a delegation for was the the query to

137
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:35,240
the hash dns server who asks to this DNS

138
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:37,490
server which is the base address in

139
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:40,690
order to have no configuration at all in

140
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:49,300
the hash DNS server which can handle

141
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:49,300
many sub sub domain of my name but order

142
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:58,940
now the DNS server that the NSA with the

143
00:10:54,830 --> 00:11:01,460
maintainer server replies with base

144
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:04,040
address actually a nice computer at the

145
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:09,230
complete address that is returned to the

146
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:10,219
client okay so in this way I have just

147
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:13,100
to put

148
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:17,420
line saying which is the base address in

149
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:20,570
the standard DNS server and everything

150
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:25,520
can be done without further

151
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:31,690
configuration but baptize your you know

152
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:35,449
the giver give it a name so now we can

153
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:41,060
use the two technology togethers

154
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:45,520
together we can have the note asking the

155
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:51,079
DNS or asking the DHCP server is its

156
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:57,380
address the DCP server asks the hash DNS

157
00:11:51,080 --> 00:12:01,610
address a and in this way everything

158
00:11:57,380 --> 00:12:04,840
converges and exhaust by the name giving

159
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:08,930
the name you can have the the trickles

160
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:11,270
the ipv6 address DNS or forward a

161
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:17,349
solution what about DNS reversal

162
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:25,760
resolution as Genessa takes a cache of

163
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:27,950
the recently sort resolved names and you

164
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:33,680
can there is a configuration you can now

165
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:36,740
you can force this cache to to to store

166
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:40,040
all the resolution but in such case you

167
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:42,020
can have out of memory attacks somebody

168
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:46,099
who can't want to resolve many many

169
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:50,810
names that can fill in your cache or you

170
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:54,380
can buy an option set the DNS server to

171
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:59,900
store just the request coming from the

172
00:12:54,380 --> 00:13:05,090
same net so the local requests you can

173
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:07,490
say if you give ipv6 address 64 of the

174
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:12,829
people six addressed by hash you can

175
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:16,639
have collisions yes that's true

176
00:13:12,829 --> 00:13:19,758
in theory because if you use some

177
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:24,110
statistics that there is a application

178
00:13:19,759 --> 00:13:27,379
case of the birthday paradox so

179
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:30,739
computing the number of possible hasha

180
00:13:27,379 --> 00:13:36,829
if you are dealing with the network of

181
00:13:30,739 --> 00:13:40,160
10 1000 not so the probability of hash

182
00:13:36,829 --> 00:13:46,040
collision is less than 10 to the minus

183
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:49,420
14th 14 so it's a quite low in case it

184
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:53,269
happens you can just change the name

185
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:57,378
instead of double cube web or something

186
00:13:53,269 --> 00:14:03,019
like that and the probability it drops

187
00:13:57,379 --> 00:14:05,869
even more if you have more collisions it

188
00:14:03,019 --> 00:14:11,269
means that you have better luck and so

189
00:14:05,869 --> 00:14:13,600
you'll need to take some some

190
00:14:11,269 --> 00:14:20,329
countermeasures about luck

191
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:24,439
okay then scenario given that the talk

192
00:14:20,329 --> 00:14:28,699
is not so expensive I decided to give

193
00:14:24,439 --> 00:14:31,059
you a virtual demo so there is the

194
00:14:28,699 --> 00:14:36,498
scenario and there are slides in which

195
00:14:31,059 --> 00:14:40,819
you can see the the sequence of comments

196
00:14:36,499 --> 00:14:46,480
and yeah the sequence of Commons and the

197
00:14:40,819 --> 00:14:50,209
expected output the scenario has been

198
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:56,449
carried on carried out on wanna VD

199
00:14:50,209 --> 00:15:01,459
Network but as the picture may may make

200
00:14:56,449 --> 00:15:05,179
evident it should be on a real network -

201
00:15:01,459 --> 00:15:08,388
so the everything applies to real or

202
00:15:05,179 --> 00:15:13,309
virtual networks in the local area

203
00:15:08,389 --> 00:15:19,939
network we have they have DNS we have

204
00:15:13,309 --> 00:15:23,740
the fully qualified DHCP server and I'm

205
00:15:19,939 --> 00:15:28,849
a client on the same net

206
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:32,200
okay and somewhere I have a DNS server

207
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:37,240
primary for this is one of our domains

208
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:41,540
weighted that sheís thought University

209
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:43,880
ok let us follow the require the the

210
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:48,319
slides can you see there at the cursor

211
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:53,660
it's a bit black but here in this part

212
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:58,730
of the slider I've copied some lines so

213
00:15:53,660 --> 00:16:03,140
from the bind nine delegation so the

214
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:07,970
whatever is hash the v-square CSU

215
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:13,939
nobility IT is dedicated to that to that

216
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:20,380
the NSA renamed the hash DNS which has

217
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:25,150
an ipv4 and ipv6 address the next line

218
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:29,689
hash we squares yes universidad mapper

219
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:32,300
without a final dot so it means that it

220
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:35,240
was also Ashby three squares yes

221
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:40,390
University map square CSU nobility is

222
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:46,190
the base address for that sub Network

223
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:51,920
and for example I use a cinema to show

224
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:55,700
that you can one questions that may

225
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:58,790
arise is that the names are related to

226
00:16:55,700 --> 00:17:07,339
the to the local area network so if you

227
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:11,619
wanna give sibling names in network you

228
00:17:07,339 --> 00:17:16,399
can you will you need to have different

229
00:17:11,619 --> 00:17:22,010
base address but you can you see names

230
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:25,520
so ever the name related to the physical

231
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:28,640
position of the host the name is related

232
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:31,010
to the physical position of the host we

233
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:34,760
changed the one generator from the hash

234
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:37,210
table and the name the short name as a

235
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:40,149
cname to the act

236
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:44,169
generated name okay that's only the

237
00:17:40,149 --> 00:17:48,219
delegation then I have connected my

238
00:17:44,169 --> 00:17:51,190
switch to to switch connected to the

239
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:53,409
Internet in the real world this means

240
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:57,010
I've connected one plug to the streets

241
00:17:53,409 --> 00:18:00,370
and the other plug to the router I've

242
00:17:57,010 --> 00:18:02,470
started on one host here on the web tour

243
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:05,939
Network but you can do it in an area

244
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:09,010
network I've started they have DNS and

245
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:13,320
which are the argument of oxygen acid

246
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:17,260
sailors now there is a proof of concept

247
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:19,210
there is a proof of concept working from

248
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:23,529
Wisconsin we are going where we are in

249
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:28,450
this time rewriting the code ways in in

250
00:18:23,529 --> 00:18:31,419
a more completed accommodated way but as

251
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:39,460
DNS to the common connected over to

252
00:18:31,419 --> 00:18:44,140
networker this is the name the the

253
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:49,809
suffix to have the base address so this

254
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:50,380
hash DNS query for cache which were blah

255
00:18:49,809 --> 00:18:56,080
blah

256
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:58,539
it it searches in the DNS cache which

257
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:03,158
query as the university maps which

258
00:18:58,539 --> 00:19:07,059
Square CSU nobility so you have the ipv4

259
00:19:03,159 --> 00:19:08,830
address so with the default gateway ipv6

260
00:19:07,059 --> 00:19:11,590
address with the default gateway and

261
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:14,770
that's enough for the happiness are no

262
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:22,809
more configuration for qualified

263
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:27,490
immunity SCP is even simpler because you

264
00:19:22,809 --> 00:19:29,710
can just start the the server saying

265
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:35,440
which is the interface of the virtual

266
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:39,549
network it has to run in so let us try

267
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:44,500
some experiments of virtual experiments

268
00:19:39,549 --> 00:19:46,840
so one experiment is use this

269
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:49,840
infrastructure to give addresses to

270
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:50,310
namespaces because we now has been in

271
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:55,199
space

272
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:59,669
if you try if you just type with ENSO

273
00:19:55,200 --> 00:20:04,080
video dot slash slash believed that

274
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:05,640
social action is as kind of URL in which

275
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:08,520
you can use a different kind of

276
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:12,990
technologies which is legacy technology

277
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:19,190
VD but you can have weeks VD or many

278
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:19,190
others really if you want now

279
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:35,970
unfortunately the AC client does not

280
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:37,680
have a option in common line to say send

281
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:40,580
a fully qualified domain name so the

282
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:42,960
only way is to create a temporary

283
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:47,040
configuration file to say just that

284
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:49,380
option so I created this temporary

285
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:52,500
configuration file with this with this

286
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:57,000
command is just a single line of a

287
00:20:52,500 --> 00:21:03,600
configuration and then I asked about the

288
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:06,540
DAC client to give an address and just

289
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:09,840
using this the whole infrastructure came

290
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:15,020
to this namespace and ipv6 address so

291
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:21,570
and forward the reverse configuration

292
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:23,790
mmm if you have a KVA machine that's the

293
00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:31,770
common to start with KVM machine

294
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:36,780
connected to VD you can just add in the

295
00:21:31,770 --> 00:21:48,629
ATA in the interface dot t-- file the

296
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:51,330
two lines of the first slide and now I'm

297
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:55,160
sorry for these two lines it is

298
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:59,100
explained it in the next slide because

299
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:59,910
I've taken as you can see phoenixes oh

300
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:02,209
sorry

301
00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:02,210
a

302
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:12,270
city-based well-known image so to show

303
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:15,890
you that is nothing as in the system but

304
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:19,310
that configuration and the files

305
00:22:15,890 --> 00:22:22,770
generated by the script these are

306
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:24,389
general these two files are the

307
00:22:22,770 --> 00:22:29,670
scripture to use the fully qualified

308
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:32,150
domain in the ACP in a 15 which is which

309
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:37,500
are general not related to the specific

310
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:41,730
addresses this specific node so given

311
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:44,700
you add these two files to to give the

312
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:47,520
fabric down and the rules to apply in

313
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:57,120
order to get to take an interface up and

314
00:22:47,520 --> 00:23:01,110
down and I fulfilled my promise and the

315
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:05,669
premises and in this way I have given

316
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:13,800
the IP address forward the reversal

317
00:23:05,670 --> 00:23:17,550
resolution in into lines 10.0 I told you

318
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:21,720
for the reversal resolution that there

319
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:26,700
is a cache of the recently resolved

320
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:32,010
names to have the reversal solution one

321
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:37,350
may say but after a while this kind of

322
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:42,510
casual can expire but given the ACP that

323
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:46,350
from time to time is renewing the the

324
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:49,290
address the ACP is also reviewing the

325
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:56,219
reverse resolution so everything seems

326
00:23:49,290 --> 00:23:59,730
to be in army so if you have question or

327
00:23:56,220 --> 00:24:02,310
for further info you can have a look of

328
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:03,960
our wiki site where there is the

329
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:06,600
Leicester the long list of all

330
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:10,760
approaches or obviously you can contact

331
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:10,760
me by email thank you

332
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:24,690
Thank You Renzo any questions for Renzo

333
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:26,490
Andre hi this is Andre from I see so so

334
00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:26,790
my question is and I might have missed

335
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:28,680
it

336
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:30,720
who is a target audience for this

337
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:33,330
because it breaks quite a lot of

338
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:36,800
assumptions about the ipv6 like privacy

339
00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:39,870
or who configures the IP address so so

340
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:42,810
who is the who's the user and user so

341
00:24:39,870 --> 00:24:50,699
who would use your technology that so

342
00:24:42,810 --> 00:24:54,090
that's my best maintenance of DNS or

343
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:57,260
design of DNA so the wanna add this

344
00:24:54,090 --> 00:25:02,480
feature or maintainer of the Anessa were

345
00:24:57,260 --> 00:25:06,360
too busy to add useless ipv6 addresses

346
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:11,310
so these features could be integrated in

347
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:16,560
future dns servers or the community of

348
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:21,720
dns development can help us to provide a

349
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:26,000
final solution a final implementation of

350
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:26,000
these ideas in the most effective way

351
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:33,199
Dimitri I don't give you Mike

352
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:40,249
for many highly available servers it is

353
00:25:37,519 --> 00:25:43,249
common to assign multiple IP addresses

354
00:25:40,249 --> 00:25:46,399
to multiple hosts which served the same

355
00:25:43,249 --> 00:25:47,989
fully qualified domain name such that by

356
00:25:46,399 --> 00:25:51,559
definition you will have the hash

357
00:25:47,989 --> 00:25:54,889
collision how do you resolve that when

358
00:25:51,559 --> 00:25:57,168
you want to serve archive dub intercom

359
00:25:54,889 --> 00:26:03,070
from many servers which all should have

360
00:25:57,169 --> 00:26:06,230
ipv6 addresses that's quite still and

361
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:10,720
don't you give those machines also IP

362
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:10,720
Spurs serves they run at a given time

363
00:26:11,649 --> 00:26:16,070
normally you do but if you want to use

364
00:26:13,909 --> 00:26:18,649
this then all of them will get assigned

365
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:22,359
the same hash and the same IP right I

366
00:26:18,649 --> 00:26:28,209
think we have two different kind of

367
00:26:22,359 --> 00:26:32,389
users if you have a year to observer

368
00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:35,649
supplying managing hundreds millions of

369
00:26:32,389 --> 00:26:39,049
queries per second you need that kind of

370
00:26:35,649 --> 00:26:41,359
solutions and you have not so many of

371
00:26:39,049 --> 00:26:45,440
them so even writing the address is not

372
00:26:41,359 --> 00:26:47,989
a problem but if you have every switch

373
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:50,330
in your room having an IP address and

374
00:26:47,989 --> 00:26:54,649
you want to query that so you want the

375
00:26:50,330 --> 00:26:57,889
address of that in such a case writing

376
00:26:54,649 --> 00:27:02,570
down the twenty 128-bit for ease of time

377
00:26:57,889 --> 00:27:04,758
is quite a daunting procedure think

378
00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:07,539
about the first idea said that we want

379
00:27:04,759 --> 00:27:11,739
to give the address of Perl to processes

380
00:27:07,539 --> 00:27:18,999
so in such a case one address is enough

381
00:27:11,739 --> 00:27:18,999
okay one more quick question for Enzo

382
00:27:20,619 --> 00:27:25,418
let's do start here

383
00:27:22,759 --> 00:27:25,419
big big quick

384
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:30,750
it's encryption something which is also

385
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:32,668
of interest for DNS of people

386
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:34,350
I mean hashing is one thing but do

387
00:27:32,669 --> 00:27:36,539
people want to encrypt their DNS as well

388
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:37,709
because once you've once you've once

389
00:27:36,539 --> 00:27:39,150
you've hashed its then I was thinking

390
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:42,480
the next step would be to make it so

391
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:44,130
other people can't snoop is is that not

392
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:48,799
how it works or is that not a nice

393
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:51,570
option I don't think that's endoscope

394
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:52,520
but well what we're having a couple of

395
00:27:51,570 --> 00:28:00,600
talks about that later

396
00:27:52,520 --> 00:28:02,960
stick around so Erin last question what

397
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:06,480
about I just Express the extensions

398
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:08,490
accurate this substitutes the privacy

399
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:11,450
attention because one problem out the

400
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:11,450
ipv6 out

401
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:17,668
stateless also configuration is that you

402
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:20,220
give your MAC address this is just

403
00:28:17,669 --> 00:28:24,020
relations with the name so you don't

404
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:26,159
have an improvement with your IP

405
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:28,668
self-generative use excel dress nobody

406
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:28,669
can see it

407
00:28:29,690 --> 00:28:33,900
okay thank you Renzo thanks here thank

408
00:28:33,299 --> 00:28:39,109
you

409
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:39,109
[Applause]
