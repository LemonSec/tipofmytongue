1
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,600
his

2
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,359
leadership integrity compassion and

3
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,880
dynamism played a huge role

4
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:23,199
in sustaining and building the zen

5
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:26,080
project community

6
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:27,519
lars's foresight was invaluable he had a

7
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,400
clear view of trends

8
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:32,879
and any future difficulties he was

9
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,879
highly respected by those who knew him

10
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,200
if lars said something was important it

11
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:40,480
would be done

12
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:43,440
on a personal level lars was frank open

13
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,078
funny and generally great to be around

14
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:48,160
he will be

15
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:48,640
deeply missed i'd also like to read out

16
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,120
a short

17
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:53,440
tribute from george dunlap one of my

18
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,599
last colleagues

19
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:58,399
lars invested a lot of personal energy

20
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:00,239
in the success of the zen project

21
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:01,520
lars had a gift for communicating across

22
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:03,199
boundaries

23
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,879
once he wrote some slides to train one

24
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:06,798
of our participant companies

25
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,479
on how to effectively engage in open

26
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:10,479
source

27
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:12,000
he sent them to our team for feedback

28
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:15,840
and almost all we could say

29
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,439
is wow these slides are amazing

30
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,040
his work on effective communication

31
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:19,758
guidelines part of the code of conduct

32
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,080
currently in the

33
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:23,119
zen project approval process distill

34
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:26,880
down a decade

35
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:28,240
of work of open source experience

36
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:31,920
i expect them to become a useful

37
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,920
resource for many open source projects

38
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:36,400
he was a tireless peacekeeper who tried

39
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,880
to listen and give everyone

40
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,759
and help everyone understand one another

41
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:43,439
bridging gaps

42
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:44,799
and giving feedback george says i could

43
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:46,880
trust lars's sense of what would be

44
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:49,600
politically wise or unwise to say

45
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:51,360
far more than my own i'll miss the way

46
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,960
that lars always panic the week before

47
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,119
the submission deadline for zen summit

48
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,640
because so few talks have been submitted

49
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:58,640
we always ended up with more talks than

50
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,640
we could accept

51
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,560
i'll miss him hearing him say that

52
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,360
somebody or something is driving me nuts

53
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,840
or him

54
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:09,598
explain oh but you see this is how this

55
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:13,200
works

56
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:14,640
so uh thank you um maybe there are some

57
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,760
other people here want to say something

58
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,319
to

59
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,319
me yeah

60
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:27,040
yes i guess i just wanted to add that um

61
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:28,238
uh okay i guess i may just wanted to add

62
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,720
that um

63
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:31,360
doing this for lars here at fosdem in

64
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,560
particular

65
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:37,680
is very weird and very sad

66
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:39,440
because fosdem i mean i was um

67
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,920
i'm a former colleague of arts we were

68
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:43,040
colleagues at citrix until i was working

69
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:46,799
for surgery myself

70
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:49,280
then i changed job and

71
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,080
fosdem was one of the event where since

72
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,840
i was working for

73
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,239
from home so frozen was one of the

74
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:57,440
events where we see each other

75
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:57,440
and it was

76
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:01,679
i remember it very well that it was

77
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:06,480
because of lars

78
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:09,440
that some nine or ten years ago

79
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,000
the same project actually started to uh

80
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,640
invest

81
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,680
in fosdem and push to have a boost who

82
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,399
she pushed us

83
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,200
developers to submit thoughts to the dev

84
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,879
room

85
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:24,319
come stay at the booth and interact with

86
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:27,518
the fosdem crowd and actually staying

87
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:29,359
there at the booth with him was really

88
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:31,360
quite an experience and so it's

89
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:34,640
particularly

90
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:36,879
i don't know touch into remembering here

91
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,000
and yeah also as a personal level he was

92
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:41,599
a very good friend

93
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:44,720
he helped me again at a personal level

94
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:47,760
without it being necessary

95
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:51,760
only because he just it was

96
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:54,879
like how it is and so yeah i will

97
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,879
miss him very very much

98
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:02,000
well then it's really hard to find the

99
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:04,720
right words because

100
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,200
uh in fact last helped me to make my

101
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:08,959
first

102
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:12,480
talk at fosdem back maybe in 2013

103
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:13,200
and he was a great somehow mentor but

104
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:16,079
also

105
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,399
someone able to to push you to do stuff

106
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,560
uh

107
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:20,159
if if he thinks that matters then he

108
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:23,280
will have his support

109
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:26,800
and also he helped us to integrate

110
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:29,359
the linux foundation recently and that's

111
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,560
because he decided to to do that that

112
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,919
was possible

113
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:37,120
and without him uh all the projects

114
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:39,280
i started won't be there today so uh

115
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,320
and on a personal level uh it's also

116
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:43,758
really sad because

117
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:47,040
he was really a nice guy also a friend

118
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:49,280
and well at this time i'm happy to

119
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:51,360
to to have shared some moments with

120
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:55,198
wells last because it was really

121
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:58,000
really fun and i remember his love

122
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:59,440
yeah and well it's it's a bit hard to to

123
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,280
express all the feelings

124
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:05,520
but anyway uh um i i think um

125
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:08,000
it's the right time to say goodbye

126
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,000
goodbye and

127
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:19,549
farewell

128
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:19,550
[Applause]

129
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,880
you
