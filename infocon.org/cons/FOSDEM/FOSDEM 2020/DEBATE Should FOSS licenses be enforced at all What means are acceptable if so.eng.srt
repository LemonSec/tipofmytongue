1
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:08,160
so

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:09,120
our first debate is should false

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:14,719
licenses be

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:17,680
enforced at all and we have

5
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:20,880
pamela chester giovanni gaurus mark

6
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:23,840
jones and mccoy smith

7
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,840
and um

8
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:28,560
who gets to go first

9
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,840
giovanni

10
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:36,160
so we're still struggling with the

11
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:38,079
projector so

12
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:45,839
you don't need it okay so let me give

13
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:45,840
you um

14
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:04,320
yes well

15
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:05,840
can i stop yesterday

16
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:13,839
because we need that message that's on

17
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:13,840
that paper to be up every time

18
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:20,059
[Music]

19
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:31,520
okay

20
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:41,840
wait no how do we get that projector

21
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:41,840
i'll do it

22
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,399
we're taking attendance first

23
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,840
okay can we stop are we good

24
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:19,920
okay shall we stop okay

25
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:21,920
well good morning everyone it seems that

26
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:24,559
every time i have to talk at first then

27
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:26,879
something is going to happen

28
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,080
last time i talked here we went through

29
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:30,799
three mics

30
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,280
this time just the the screen went out

31
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,519
so

32
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:36,319
i don't know whether it's a coincidence

33
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:39,840
or that's a problem with me but anyways

34
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:43,200
uh so uh i have uh to talk

35
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:46,720
about uh enforcement and why

36
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:49,679
uh enforcement is uh is good or

37
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,480
what what are the main the main points

38
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,040
and

39
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:54,079
uh what what where can i start well

40
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:57,120
where can i start

41
00:02:54,080 --> 00:03:00,400
i can start maybe by

42
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:03,519
uh quoting some very famous quote

43
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,760
by a well-known author shakespeare

44
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:06,640
who says and it's very famous the first

45
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:10,000
thing we do

46
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:13,200
let's kill all the lawyers well some

47
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:16,800
some of you may find it amusing but

48
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:18,640
on the other hand it won't it won't

49
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,480
it won't change the fact that

50
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:23,440
controversies will happen

51
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,319
and therefore uh if we want whether we

52
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:27,280
want or not

53
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:28,560
we need enforcement that's that's the

54
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,120
main point and

55
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,000
first of all we have to define what we

56
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,040
what we mean by

57
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,840
enforcement is enforcement litigation is

58
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,560
enforcement

59
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,360
only when you go to court only when you

60
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,000
really

61
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,599
bring your cause to the tribunal or is

62
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,480
just

63
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:47,440
not a gentle nudge but maybe asking for

64
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,720
compliance

65
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:52,239
asking politely and then asking maybe

66
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,959
with a louder voice

67
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:55,840
is this enforcement i think it is i

68
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:59,519
think that's

69
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:03,040
this enforcement and i think that this

70
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:04,720
this vision is upheld also about what

71
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,560
but also by the principle of

72
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:09,760
community-oriented enforcement

73
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:12,480
but also of the by the gps

74
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:14,798
the gpl cooperation commitment this is

75
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:17,918
another example it doesn't rule out

76
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:20,560
enforcement it says that even if

77
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:23,120
the scope is mass is much less broad

78
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:25,759
than the principle of community-oriented

79
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:27,360
oriented sorry oriented enforcement for

80
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:30,400
gpl compliance

81
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,360
anyways enforcement is still a

82
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,159
possibility

83
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,040
and also the linux kernel enforcement

84
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:38,320
statement

85
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:40,080
does not deny enforcement not only

86
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:42,159
because it is in the first

87
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:44,159
in the name itself or the of the

88
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:47,360
statement but also because

89
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,720
it only describes that enforcement has

90
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:52,000
to be made

91
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:54,720
uh in as to be defined

92
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,960
in scope the scope of the of enforcement

93
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,880
is not personal gain

94
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,320
the scope of the enforcement is not

95
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:03,199
copyright trolling

96
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,919
the scope of enforcement it doesn't have

97
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:07,280
to have

98
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:09,919
a negative impact on health and growth

99
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,320
of software ecosystem i'm quoting from

100
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:13,599
the

101
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:17,039
linux kernel enforcement system and so

102
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,759
it is as i as i pointed out a necessary

103
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:21,120
evil

104
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:24,639
because let's i do just

105
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:26,880
let me do a personal example

106
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:28,160
under italian law you may tell from my

107
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:31,440
accent that i'm not

108
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,440
exactly british but

109
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:38,000
in when the code of

110
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:40,320
of the code of public of a digital

111
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,919
administration came into force in italy

112
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:44,880
in 2006 it was a fantastic piece of

113
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:48,799
legislation

114
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:51,759
with fantastic principle digital

115
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,400
digital rights for the citizens but

116
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:56,080
there were

117
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:59,198
there were no consequences at all

118
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:02,560
for any violation so a

119
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:05,360
an old professor of mine told me okay

120
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,080
yes but this is very fun but what

121
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,759
happens

122
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:11,359
if you violated it well nothing

123
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:13,440
nothing you cannot force the public

124
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,680
administration you don't have any cause

125
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,960
of

126
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,720
action and so guess what when the code

127
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:21,198
of public administration

128
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:23,120
uh get some got some momentum when they

129
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:26,400
introduce the consequences

130
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:28,800
when they introduce a way to force the

131
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,840
to force public administration to comply

132
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,960
with it so

133
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:34,400
i'm not telling that we have to enforce

134
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:37,440
every single violation

135
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,479
absolutely not i'm not telling that we

136
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:43,199
have to enforce

137
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:46,080
even the most common or maybe just

138
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:47,120
trivial violation and just i just have

139
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:50,318
to tell that

140
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:53,440
we cannot we cannot uh deprive

141
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:54,160
ourselves of the fact that we have to to

142
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:58,479
defend

143
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:58,479
our freedoms also because

144
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:02,400
a recent case of the european court of

145
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:05,599
justice

146
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:08,638
stated that when you breach

147
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:10,240
a license agreement you are in breach of

148
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:13,520
copyright you are in breach

149
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:16,319
you you are availed of the same remedies

150
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:17,120
you have for copyright infringement and

151
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:19,520
this

152
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,800
curiously enough is the same statement

153
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:23,198
that was uh

154
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:25,440
was given by the court in the first gpl

155
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:28,680
compliance case i saw the

156
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:30,960
veterans suicide com of the municipal of

157
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:34,400
2004 and so we have

158
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:35,599
we really we really have a a powerful

159
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:38,479
weapon but

160
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:39,759
as as any powerful weapon we do not we

161
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:42,000
don't have to do it

162
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:45,120
to use it in a futile way we don't know

163
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:48,479
if as i said before we are not to use

164
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:51,360
in any case compliance is a process

165
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:52,400
and we already have some agreements

166
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,520
which can

167
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:57,520
be used for describing this

168
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,560
this process and but it is very

169
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:01,599
important

170
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:04,560
to to do it and be prepared

171
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:05,360
for litigation for litigation as well

172
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,800
which is

173
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:12,160
a real complex topic so uh

174
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:14,960
enforcement is not something that

175
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,599
you have the communities to be scared

176
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,840
because

177
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:19,919
because we owe also to the copyright

178
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:23,039
holders we owe to the community

179
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:25,359
we absolutely have to uh

180
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:26,159
make people understand that they have

181
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,879
their eyes

182
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:30,960
and their eyes can be uh can be

183
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:34,399
protected also because

184
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:37,199
uh no one not not everyone

185
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:38,000
is behaving correctly there are of

186
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,120
course some

187
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,839
bad guys i would say i'm not going i

188
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,959
won't go

189
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:49,040
against people who violate

190
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:51,518
the copyleft licenses just by mistake

191
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,319
or by the fact that they misunderstood

192
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:54,800
something

193
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,839
but when the violation when the

194
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:59,839
violation

195
00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:02,880
is when the violation is uh

196
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:06,720
really willful then we will go

197
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:10,080
we will go and try to get compliance

198
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:12,800
and also just to conclude uh we

199
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:15,040
have to think that maybe some of the

200
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:18,959
arguments against enforcement

201
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:22,160
go uh and uh derive for a misconception

202
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:22,880
uh copyright is not as patent enforcing

203
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:27,199
copyright

204
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:29,360
is good copy left yes copy left

205
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:31,820
is stands for copyright we have to

206
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:33,600
defend our eyes thank you

207
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:35,680
[Applause]

208
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,440
okay so i think the format that we all

209
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:38,959
agreed to was each of us is going to do

210
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,440
a seven-minute presentation which

211
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:43,279
giovanni volunteered to do first

212
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:45,519
and then the people on the opposing side

213
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:47,680
which would be pam and i

214
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:48,800
uh get to do cross-examination or

215
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,560
rebuttal so you gotta

216
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:53,760
you gotta continue to stand up there

217
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:55,279
while i cross examine you

218
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,360
but first you need to raise your right

219
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:59,360
hand and say it after me

220
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,959
so i got three minutes i i have two

221
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,760
questions and the one is not really a

222
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:05,518
rebuttal one

223
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:08,160
sort of is when you're talking about

224
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:12,640
enforcement you got any thoughts on

225
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:17,839
whether that's a preferable

226
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:19,120
course to take civil versus common law

227
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:21,279
since you're from a civil law

228
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:23,600
jurisdiction i don't know much about

229
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:27,120
that i'm a common law person

230
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:30,480
uh second isn't it true that the

231
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:33,440
gpl cooperation commitment by

232
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:36,480
excluding certain storms forms of

233
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:38,320
enforcement is not being beneficial

234
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,680
doesn't that essentially concede that

235
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:44,399
there are problems with

236
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:47,439
enforcement well first question

237
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:47,920
of course i will i will go for the civil

238
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,560
law

239
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,599
uh for civil litigation but i have to

240
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:54,800
point to one

241
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:56,880
uh one issue in several states uh

242
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:59,040
this kind of refreshment may also be

243
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:02,000
criminal and i would never

244
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,480
go for the criminal prosecution so i

245
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,120
would

246
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,480
i would say this would not be a right

247
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:09,360
way to enforce them

248
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:11,120
second question yes you're totally right

249
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:14,160
enforcement has problems

250
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:16,240
but you cannot rule out

251
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:18,079
as the last resource this that's the

252
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:21,600
main point you cannot say

253
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:26,319
we won't enforce whatsoever you have

254
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:26,320
to find a good way to benefit the

255
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:29,839
community

256
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,279
no further questions

257
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:46,480
so i am taking the contrary view to uh

258
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,440
enforcement so first i would like to say

259
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,120
that uh

260
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,120
the definition of enforcement that i am

261
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,320
working on means litigation it means

262
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,720
bringing lawsuits

263
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,079
i'm not talking about politely asking

264
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,399
people to provide source code

265
00:11:56,079 --> 00:12:00,000
or to comply with the license but taking

266
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:02,000
an aggressive action of litigation

267
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,240
against them

268
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,399
so i'll start by saying nelson mandela

269
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,040
said if you want to make peace with your

270
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:09,279
enemy

271
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:11,040
you have to work with your enemy then he

272
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:12,720
becomes your partner

273
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,719
so then he becomes your partner that's

274
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:17,440
the critical point here

275
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:19,120
so free software has had wide adoption

276
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,519
widespread adoption

277
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,399
the various sources that i have seen

278
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:25,680
cited

279
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:26,959
say between 50 and 100 percent of all

280
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:30,239
software distributed

281
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:34,239
contains free software so if

282
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:37,360
if we measure the success of software as

283
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:40,240
use of it then free software has been

284
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:42,720
wildly successful

285
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,560
however the success of this software is

286
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,639
only because of the collaborative nature

287
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,279
of the development model that's used for

288
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:49,920
it

289
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:51,279
so collaboration brings fresh ideas it

290
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,439
brings enthusiasm

291
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:54,800
enthusiasm when other people when other

292
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,360
people have waned

293
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,560
it brings new insight into old problems

294
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,880
so we need to

295
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,760
we need to have this continuous

296
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:05,040
contribution

297
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:07,120
contributor feedback loop going

298
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:08,160
but collaboration you can't have

299
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,639
collaboration an

300
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:12,800
environment where there's not trust and

301
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:15,360
suing people for non-compliance

302
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:16,240
will break all trust and it will push

303
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,079
away people

304
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,279
instead of welcoming them into the

305
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:21,359
community

306
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:23,600
they may abandon all use of free

307
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,279
software altogether as a result of it

308
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:27,040
and they may switch to proprietary

309
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:30,079
software

310
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:32,000
this this a switch like that would be

311
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:34,000
something that the legal department

312
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,320
would be advocate very strongly

313
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,240
for legal departments are risk-averse

314
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:40,800
this is a different world

315
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:42,639
and they're not happy with it so to this

316
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,319
and to this day as a result of the busy

317
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:45,279
box lawsuits which were more than ten

318
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,199
years ago

319
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:48,560
they still still strike fear into the

320
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:50,240
heart of legal departments

321
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,920
and as a result there are companies that

322
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,880
are so mistrustful of open source

323
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,800
software

324
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:56,320
that the prospect of and the prospect of

325
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:59,279
getting sued

326
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:00,720
that they um forbid the use of the gpl

327
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:03,439
altogether

328
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:05,920
in their environments so once you've

329
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:07,760
created that mistrust it is very hard to

330
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:09,680
build that trust again

331
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:11,839
it takes it'll take years to rebuild

332
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:13,680
that and what you're losing during all

333
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:15,519
that time is all of those contributions

334
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:19,439
that could have been made

335
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:21,519
by that by that entity that was sued

336
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,440
so and i'll also point out here that

337
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:24,160
it's only commercial companies that get

338
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,600
sued

339
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,439
we're not talking about individual

340
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,959
developers here who are

341
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:31,120
out of compliance who are being who are

342
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:34,000
being targeted

343
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:35,760
so you're talking about targeting a huge

344
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,440
swath of developers companies that have

345
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,480
a lot of people who may be contributors

346
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,519
but are going to be

347
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:44,560
barred from contributing

348
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:46,320
and and from those companies who have

349
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:48,239
the financial wherewithal

350
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,839
to support the development effort of

351
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,240
free software

352
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:54,560
um so this is this is how you impair the

353
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,760
growth of the software commons

354
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:58,800
you're not feeding it you're not

355
00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:00,639
fertilizing it you're impairing it

356
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:02,160
and litigation then also has a ripple

357
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:04,240
effect beyond

358
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:06,240
just the beyond just this core project

359
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:08,320
that was the target of the litigation

360
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:10,320
beyond just the non-complying company

361
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:12,800
and beyond even just this one plaintiff

362
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:15,680
who brought the lawsuit the community

363
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:18,479
will lose value because of the potential

364
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:19,760
contributions

365
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,600
the project will lose value because of

366
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:23,439
these potential contributions by the

367
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:26,800
sued party

368
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:28,720
but not only that they may then not want

369
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:32,240
to contribute to any other

370
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:34,320
software projects that they use

371
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:36,399
the project will lose potential users

372
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:38,160
and contributors who might have joined

373
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:40,079
because of what the sued company brought

374
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:41,600
to the table for that project its

375
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:42,959
improvements and developments on the

376
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:46,079
project

377
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:49,040
and then other even other members of the

378
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:52,239
project may become so disenchanted

379
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:54,639
by the the litigation and the lawsuit

380
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:56,720
that they break ties with the project so

381
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:58,959
you may lose developers as a result of

382
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:01,279
this litigation

383
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:02,638
um and let's also just recognize that

384
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:06,160
litigation

385
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:07,199
is it's really um it's really a copyleft

386
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:09,199
problem

387
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:10,399
so jacob seen big hats in the united

388
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:12,800
states was

389
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:14,480
was about the artistic license which is

390
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,639
not a copyleft license

391
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:18,079
but it was a claim but it was it was

392
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:19,759
sort of an outlier because it was a

393
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:20,079
patent infringement lawsuit that with

394
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:22,800
this

395
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:24,479
with this copyright claim tacked on but

396
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:26,319
i've never heard of anyone complaining

397
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,759
about non-compliance and certainly not

398
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,519
even complaining about non-compliance

399
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:30,560
much less suing on non-compliance with

400
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:33,519
the mit

401
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:34,079
the bsd or the apache licenses so it's

402
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:36,800
really just

403
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:38,000
it's really just a copyleft problem and

404
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,920
then

405
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,519
and then also keep in mind that we're

406
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,399
talking here about cases where the

407
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:45,279
recalcitrant

408
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:47,199
sharer has been approached and advised

409
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:48,000
of the non-compliance back to giovanni's

410
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:49,519
point that

411
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,279
it's not just you know we're suing

412
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:52,720
people at the drop of a hat

413
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:54,320
they've they have had they've been

414
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,199
notified and they have time to come into

415
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,680
compliance

416
00:16:55,199 --> 00:17:00,639
but for some reason they have chosen not

417
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:03,040
to comply this is a choice on their part

418
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:04,959
they've chosen to fight and when they

419
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:06,799
choose to fight it's going to be a long

420
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:09,439
and expensive one and this is going to

421
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:12,000
be time and energy spent

422
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:13,439
on litigation that could be much better

423
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,480
spent in other ways

424
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:18,959
and it's also likely just going to get

425
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:21,360
some orphan bit of software

426
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:23,120
a bit that is not may not end up being

427
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:23,839
valuable to the larger project as a

428
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:25,198
whole

429
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:28,559
because it's not been part of the

430
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:30,240
development process all along

431
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:31,918
is it so is it really worth it is it

432
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,039
really worth it to go through this

433
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:36,320
expensive

434
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:38,799
time-consuming litigation just for maybe

435
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:41,918
a loadable kernel module is is that is

436
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:44,960
it really worth the candle to do that

437
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:46,400
so um and and there's even now less

438
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,919
reason to sue

439
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,760
for compliance than there was during the

440
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:52,640
busy box years

441
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:53,760
now there are more pressures to

442
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:57,440
contribute to

443
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:58,640
free software software is replacing

444
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,440
hardware it's becoming much more

445
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,200
critical

446
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:03,520
it's replacing hardware it's replacing

447
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:06,400
machines it's even replacing

448
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:08,639
human acts in some cases human intellect

449
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:11,280
in some cases

450
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:13,600
and so software malfunctions are no

451
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:15,039
longer just an annoyance

452
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:17,280
but everybody understands they're

453
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:19,120
crucial that there are security issues

454
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:21,600
in software

455
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:23,840
planes crash identities are stolen

456
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:25,840
because of problems with software

457
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:27,600
companies that embed software into their

458
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,000
hardware projects are also now quite

459
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,159
savvy

460
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:33,520
and they're asking for bill of materials

461
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:35,840
from the from their supply chain

462
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:37,360
they're no longer cavalier about the

463
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:39,120
provenance and reliability of the

464
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:41,439
software

465
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:43,280
they now have come to understand that

466
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,679
communal effort is the best way to go

467
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:46,720
about

468
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:48,400
ensuring these problems don't arise

469
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,760
and when they do arise that they are

470
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:52,000
fixed quickly

471
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:53,679
so market forces are driving compliance

472
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,880
and litigation doesn't have to any

473
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:56,640
longer

474
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,080
so suing over compliance sends the

475
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,960
opposite message of what we should be

476
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:11,840
sending

477
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:11,840
messages of inclusiveness

478
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,799
i still have the mic this time is

479
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:19,039
working i won't

480
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:20,480
i won't get rid of it i will keep it

481
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:24,320
anyways two questions

482
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:27,760
yes um first one i like the way

483
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:30,720
uh we lawyers play with words i

484
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:33,919
broaden the scope of enforcement while

485
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:38,000
you're tied to litigation but

486
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:41,440
if in this case

487
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:44,720
so would you consider it fair

488
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:46,400
to just ask for compliance or issue

489
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,240
season disease letter

490
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,760
even if you don't call it enforcement

491
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:52,720
that's the first question

492
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:53,520
and the second second question is you

493
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:57,120
mentioned

494
00:19:53,520 --> 00:20:00,000
uh hardware vendors

495
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:01,600
do you think and you said that now they

496
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,320
are complying and they are

497
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:05,120
they are or they are mostly complying

498
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,559
and they are

499
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,639
also driven by the value of the

500
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:09,120
community do you think this would have

501
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:13,120
happened

502
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:15,918
the same in the same way guaranteed

503
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:17,439
for the litigation case back in 10 years

504
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:21,039
ago

505
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:24,159
um so to the first point on on

506
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:25,679
how to define compliance no i i i don't

507
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:27,840
think there's anything wrong with

508
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:29,360
with pursuing people for compliance and

509
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,000
i think there are a lot of good players

510
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,158
out there

511
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,480
who are trying to comply and if if you

512
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:35,120
bring an error to their attention they

513
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,760
will

514
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:38,639
they will be happy to happy to correct

515
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,480
that

516
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,760
um so that and that is why i define

517
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,360
because because i i

518
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:45,520
i do think it's appropriate to ask

519
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:47,678
people for short copies of source code

520
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:49,600
um as to the sort of embedded and the

521
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:52,559
upstream and much more awareness

522
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:53,678
um did it happen you know it's hard to

523
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:55,039
it's hard to

524
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:57,840
it's hard to say what would have

525
00:20:55,039 --> 00:21:00,559
happened in the absence of history

526
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:01,600
so the busy box lawsuits happened but do

527
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:03,280
i think that

528
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:05,280
they play a big role in why there's

529
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:06,559
compliance now no i don't think so i

530
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:09,039
think that what's happening is that

531
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:11,280
manufacturers are being held responsible

532
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:12,320
for uh the function of their products

533
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:15,360
and when those products

534
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:17,200
malfunction they

535
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:18,639
they need to turn to their upstream and

536
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,039
learn that they don't actually know

537
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,120
what's

538
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:22,640
what what their distributor has provided

539
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:24,559
them with they get a binary

540
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:26,000
and so they they're it simply is

541
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:27,760
business pressures

542
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,000
that have caused them to become much

543
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,400
more aware and much more cognizant and

544
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,080
much

545
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,600
and and bring the hammer down much more

546
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:35,439
and their distributors are

547
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:37,120
i'm sorry on their on their upstream

548
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,480
manufacturers to make sure

549
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:40,158
that they have it's in their it's in

550
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:41,440
their own self-interest to have it it's

551
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:43,280
not because they need

552
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:45,200
it's it's in their it's in their simply

553
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:46,480
their liability self-interest not just

554
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:48,240
that they need to provide the source

555
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:50,400
code make the source code available

556
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:53,520
um but it's in there it's just in their

557
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,520
business interest to do it

558
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:16,960
all right are you next

559
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:18,879
all right um

560
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,320
pam thank you for sharing your thoughts

561
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,320
uh

562
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:24,080
the the problem with the argument about

563
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:26,080
not doing enforcement though is that

564
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:27,439
um that kind of presupposes that the

565
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,639
community has a choice

566
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,480
about whether or not enforcement's going

567
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:32,960
to happen because the reality is is that

568
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:34,640
enforcement happens this isn't a

569
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,440
question of whether or not enforcement

570
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:38,159
should happen

571
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:39,760
it's going to happen we see it happening

572
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:41,760
all the time

573
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:43,360
you can narrow enforcement down to a

574
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:45,200
definition like oh we're just talking

575
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:47,360
about lawsuits and litigation

576
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,400
that's fine but those are actually going

577
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:50,399
on

578
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:52,559
and you don't need to be a member of the

579
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,919
community to be involved in enforcement

580
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:55,440
actions there are lawsuits that are

581
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:57,919
going on right now

582
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:59,200
between large corporations who are using

583
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:01,520
free software

584
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:03,120
they got into a commercial dispute and

585
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:06,080
what those licenses mean

586
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:07,840
are part of that dispute pam mentioned

587
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,559
that you know this is that commercial

588
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,760
actors

589
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:10,720
part of what's happening is like well

590
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,840
they need to be able to fix their

591
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,360
products so they're going to deal with

592
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,720
upstream right well they have agreements

593
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,760
with upstream

594
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,760
they're going to enforce those

595
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:19,200
agreements that's part of enforcement if

596
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:22,158
that relationship goes bad

597
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:24,480
there's going to be litigation and all

598
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:26,480
of the activities that she was okay with

599
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:28,400
are often very commonly called

600
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:30,799
pre-litigation activities

601
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:32,400
the reason why those work is because

602
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:33,600
there is the threat of litigation there

603
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,440
so even if you want to narrow the

604
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:38,559
definition down to litigation

605
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:40,159
it is not possible to say that

606
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:41,760
you know you can just take that off the

607
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:42,880
table and then all these other tools are

608
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,879
going to be possible

609
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:48,320
the fact that litigation is possible is

610
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:48,320
what makes the other tools work

611
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,400
and we're seeing this happen already

612
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,039
right there are people out there doing

613
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,880
enforcement

614
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:57,039
we have trolls everyone in this room is

615
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:59,120
probably aware of the patrick mccarty

616
00:23:57,039 --> 00:24:01,039
cases right like that happened we can't

617
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:03,039
we can't tell people to not do that

618
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:05,600
again all we can do

619
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:07,440
is see what's happening on the courts

620
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,678
and decide how we're going to react to

621
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,279
it

622
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:11,679
one of those could be we could just sit

623
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:13,120
by the side right and let trolls define

624
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:15,039
how this is going to play out in courts

625
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:16,399
and let trolls define the playing field

626
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:18,960
and hope that it doesn't work out for

627
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:20,159
them that's one possibility but the

628
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,520
trolls are going to keep trying they're

629
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:23,600
going to keep looking for a way to use

630
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:25,120
these licenses

631
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,719
companies are already doing this right

632
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:28,158
you have two large insurance companies a

633
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,600
couple of years ago in the united states

634
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:31,520
or a large insurance company

635
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:33,520
and a software manufacturer who didn't

636
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:34,799
care about free software licenses they

637
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:36,158
didn't even realize that free software

638
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:37,918
licenses were involved

639
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:40,000
until they got well into litigation they

640
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:41,520
said oh here's my commercial here's my

641
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,120
advantage in this lawsuit

642
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:44,720
now i'm going to turn this into an

643
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:47,439
enforcement action

644
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:48,640
like it happens um and then we had

645
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:50,159
somebody who produced the software

646
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,760
getting notified and they looked for the

647
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:53,760
opportunity to profit off of it

648
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:55,279
they didn't do that in a principled way

649
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,320
they saw an opportunity to make money

650
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:57,840
off of it and we don't know how that

651
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:59,520
actually got settled but the fact that

652
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:01,039
things got settled it probably was not

653
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:02,320
for the promise

654
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:05,440
that people are going to behave better

655
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:07,439
right they didn't they did it in secret

656
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,960
um they didn't there was no there was no

657
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:10,799
compliance coming out of any of the

658
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:12,559
companies afterwards somebody got paid

659
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:14,080
for that like that is typically why you

660
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:14,960
settle is you give me this bunch of

661
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:17,120
money here

662
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:18,960
and i'll go away quietly right on the

663
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:20,479
other hand there are some enforcement

664
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:22,080
actions and there are some community

665
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,960
actors who have principles around

666
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,799
enforcement

667
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:26,400
and what's wrong with setting up a

668
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:27,679
system where we say

669
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,440
we as a community the people who

670
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:30,400
actually believe in free software values

671
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:32,960
people who believe

672
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:34,000
in user freedoms are going to enforce

673
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,520
these licenses

674
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,039
and if you don't listen to us there's

675
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:38,639
going to be consequences

676
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:40,640
but we are going to go about this in a

677
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:42,400
principled way because we care about

678
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,840
these values right so you have

679
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,880
organizations like the free software

680
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:46,240
foundation

681
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:48,000
software freedom conservancy you have

682
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:50,080
come up with community principles

683
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,000
you have commercial actors like red hat

684
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:53,678
who's leading you know gpl

685
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,120
cooperation agreements on enforcement

686
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:56,559
around the linux kernel right

687
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:59,039
these are principled ways of doing

688
00:25:56,559 --> 00:26:00,879
enforcement it's not necessarily bad

689
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:02,320
to do enforcement there might be good

690
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:03,279
ways to do it and there might be bad

691
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:06,080
ways to do it

692
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:07,520
but just us as a community opting out

693
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,799
means that we're going to only leave the

694
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:10,400
space open for the people who are going

695
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:11,918
to do it in the bad way or at least in

696
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,679
the way that it's not principled that

697
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:17,200
doesn't care about free software values

698
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:17,200
it doesn't care about user freedoms

699
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:21,600
so we can't hide underneath the rock on

700
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:23,039
this one this isn't a question of should

701
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,480
we do it or should we not do it

702
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:25,840
someone's going to do it it's just a

703
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:27,919
question of whether or not we give them

704
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:30,320
the playing field there

705
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:31,760
and really there's lots of benefits to

706
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:33,840
litigation too right

707
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:35,440
there are companies out there they're

708
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:37,279
large commercial companies they know

709
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:38,320
what the goals of litigation is it's to

710
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:40,559
resolve a dispute

711
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:41,918
sometimes you need a third party to help

712
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:43,039
you resolve a dispute

713
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:45,039
what's wrong with that it doesn't

714
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:46,240
actually mean that you're you hate the

715
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:46,960
other person or you're scared of the

716
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,320
other person

717
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:50,400
or you'll never work with that person

718
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:51,678
again just means that you had a dispute

719
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:54,159
and you couldn't resolve it

720
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:55,919
and you need someone to come explain how

721
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:57,279
it's going to be viewed by a third party

722
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:59,200
so litigation actually has lots of

723
00:26:57,279 --> 00:27:00,400
benefits right one of the benefits of

724
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,159
litigation is

725
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,600
is that instead of people who are

726
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:05,440
involved in the community who have

727
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,879
beliefs about how these licenses should

728
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:09,279
work who have beliefs about what the

729
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:10,880
intentions of licenses should be

730
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:12,240
we can learn from people who weren't

731
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:13,919
involved in the community who weren't

732
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:15,600
involved in drafting licenses

733
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:17,760
what the words in the paper mean to

734
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,879
others right there's an opportunity for

735
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:20,720
us to learn right

736
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:22,240
this is about this in some ways luxury

737
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:23,760
is proofreading right when you go in

738
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,679
front of a judge

739
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:27,600
you ask them and say well this is what i

740
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:29,440
think the gpl means this is what i think

741
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:32,080
the mit license means

742
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:33,679
do you agree because this is what i

743
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:36,000
wanted this license to do

744
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:37,120
and if the judge disagrees well you have

745
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,799
a problem right it's

746
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:40,479
it's not fair for you to go around

747
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:41,760
saying well i intended this i intended

748
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:43,120
this when other people reading the

749
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,320
license to say but that's not what the

750
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,918
license says

751
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:47,600
all right so we can change what we're

752
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:48,480
looking for in those pre-litigation

753
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,678
activities

754
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:51,520
what kind of compliance we're looking

755
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:53,279
for on those licenses and we can write

756
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:55,200
new licenses right we can write new

757
00:27:53,279 --> 00:28:03,840
licenses that will achieve the results

758
00:27:55,200 --> 00:28:03,840
that we actually want to happen

759
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:08,000
and litigation has happened in the past

760
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,080
i think cam pam conceded this right

761
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,159
free software is being used more now

762
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:13,918
than it ever has been

763
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:16,240
and we've already had litigation on it

764
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:18,000
right the in the early 2000s

765
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:20,240
we had some high profile litigation

766
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,799
cases the busybox cases were already

767
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,679
mentioned

768
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:24,480
however you feel about those cases they

769
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:26,559
happened

770
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:27,919
and it didn't actually stop companies

771
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:30,240
from adopting free software

772
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:31,919
right in the early 2000s when those

773
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,399
cases were being brought and enforced

774
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:35,520
and other ones to

775
00:28:33,399 --> 00:28:37,678
gplviolations.org we had large

776
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:39,840
commercial actors that are saying

777
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:41,120
calling these licenses virals and

778
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,559
cancers

779
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:45,279
those companies aren't doing that

780
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:46,480
anymore right we also had litigation out

781
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:48,080
there

782
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:49,760
where was the question was were these

783
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:51,760
licenses even enforceable

784
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:53,360
right well we had litigation that was

785
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:55,360
resolved everybody come every company

786
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:58,320
knows they're enforceable now

787
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:59,199
so in conclusion uh we don't have a

788
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:01,840
choice

789
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:02,559
um companies aren't scared of it we know

790
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,320
that

791
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:05,440
um so we might as well do it in a

792
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:13,840
principled way so we can get the

793
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:13,840
benefits of it

794
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:18,480
so uh let me start by saying i'm at a

795
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:20,320
disadvantage here because

796
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:26,080
mark and i argued on the same side of

797
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:28,480
this a year ago at copyleft.com

798
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:29,120
but let me so so let me uh let me

799
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:31,600
challenge

800
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:33,199
some of the things you've said um with

801
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:36,000
resp so one of

802
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:37,440
one of the pressures that is on that

803
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,960
creates compliance

804
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:43,919
is people yes certainly sorry

805
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:44,799
uh one of the one of the uh one of the

806
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:47,440
things that

807
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:49,840
uh encourages compliance is that people

808
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:52,000
like to abide by their contracts

809
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:53,439
so simply behavior of a but people don't

810
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,799
go around intentionally

811
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:56,399
they do intentionally breach contracts

812
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:57,840
but they tend not to people tend to

813
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:59,360
stick to their contracts

814
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:01,678
so just the fact that there is an

815
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:02,479
agreement people it's not just the

816
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:04,000
litigation

817
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:05,919
it's not just the threat of litigation

818
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,679
it's not just the threat of a breach

819
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:09,440
that makes you not breach a contract it

820
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:11,440
is you as an upstanding person will

821
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:13,120
abide by your obligations under a

822
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,760
contract so it's not just litigation

823
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:16,799
that

824
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:17,760
that that is that sort of sword um one

825
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:19,520
other

826
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,879
there you've also ignored that there is

827
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:22,320
a vehicle for

828
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:24,559
these other lawsuits that are bought

829
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:26,879
brought by the ameriprises of the world

830
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:29,120
which is the opportunity to participate

831
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:30,880
as a as an amicus brief to come in and

832
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:32,879
step and educate the court

833
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:34,720
on these matters so it may not be

834
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,679
necessary for the free software

835
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:38,000
community

836
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:39,840
to bring the lawsuits but simply but

837
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:43,120
they can participate to inform

838
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:46,320
and educate the court on um the issues

839
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:47,439
of amicus through the vehicle of amicus

840
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:50,799
briefs

841
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:52,960
and totally forgot what my third point

842
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:52,960
was

843
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,799
what was whatever your last point was it

844
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:58,480
was hard to keep in my head as i was as

845
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:59,918
i was doing this seven minutes is a long

846
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:01,760
time too

847
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:02,799
well whatever your third point was i

848
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:05,840
think whatever i said has already

849
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:05,840
rebutted it

850
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:10,799
to your first point though that people

851
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:13,840
like to abide by their contracts

852
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:15,519
um i think some people do there are

853
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:16,158
definitely some people in the world who

854
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:18,320
view

855
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:20,000
relationships with people that they have

856
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:22,080
through is like they keep their word and

857
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,440
the contracts reflect that

858
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:26,080
but there are also people whose business

859
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:27,519
model is to try to get every single edge

860
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,720
and they will go about breaching

861
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:29,760
contracts if they think they can get

862
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,039
away with it

863
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,799
but at the end of the day we're also

864
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:34,240
talking about contracts you know legally

865
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:37,840
enforceable agreements

866
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:39,519
and i mean around the world can

867
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:41,279
anyone have any idea how many lawsuits

868
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:42,159
are initiated every day for breach of

869
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:44,240
contract

870
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:45,360
part of what makes contracts meaningful

871
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,880
is that people know that they're

872
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,918
enforceable there's a big difference

873
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:49,840
between saying

874
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:50,960
oh i will promise that i will do this

875
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,840
and i'm just going to say that to you

876
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:53,679
over the phone

877
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:55,519
and writing down on a piece of paper so

878
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:57,600
it's objectively visible to someone else

879
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:59,279
who can come in with enforcement power

880
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:01,039
and actually ask you to do it so that

881
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:02,559
it's part of this actually i have my

882
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:03,919
third thought that i just remember the

883
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:06,879
clock is running so i just don't

884
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:07,519
um can i can i see a show of hands of

885
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:10,399
someone

886
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:12,840
who has been sued and has warm and fuzzy

887
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:14,239
feelings toward the entity that sued

888
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:16,240
them

889
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:18,000
oh we got one we have one person so that

890
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:19,760
was my final point was you said oh it's

891
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,840
just business it's just business

892
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:24,000
i think that's an easy i think that's an

893
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:26,080
easy out to say it's a business but

894
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,600
i i have never worked at a company that

895
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:30,240
that was subject to a lawsuit

896
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:31,439
that didn't just have hateful thoughts

897
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:43,840
towards the uh

898
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:43,840
towards the other party yeah everybody

899
00:32:43,870 --> 00:32:47,600
[Applause]

900
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:49,918
so i'm the second negative here on

901
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:51,760
enforcement uh and i'm going to one-up

902
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:55,200
giovanni and pam by

903
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:55,200
having two quotes it's

904
00:32:55,840 --> 00:33:01,120
debater's trick the first is from a

905
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:03,039
supreme court justice in the united

906
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:06,080
states

907
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:09,679
about 100 years ago he said the life

908
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:13,199
of the law has not been logic

909
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:17,120
it is experienced the second

910
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:18,960
is if it ain't broke don't fix it

911
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:20,399
i'll explain both of those in a little

912
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:22,559
bit of detail here

913
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:24,320
so the life of the law is not logic it

914
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:25,440
has been experienced

915
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:27,360
you can interpret that a lot of

916
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:29,919
different ways but

917
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:30,639
to me one way to interpret that is we

918
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:33,919
should not

919
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:34,880
think of the legal system as something

920
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:38,159
that's

921
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:41,440
a logical system where

922
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:43,840
we can select the inputs it will go

923
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:47,679
through a systematic

924
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:49,678
process of analysis that's predictable

925
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:50,960
and that will get us a result that we

926
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:55,360
like

927
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:57,360
in fact it's quite contrary to that

928
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:58,559
ideally it would be logical like that

929
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:02,080
but it does not work

930
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:02,720
that way in practice more often than not

931
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:05,918
or i

932
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:07,840
should say somewhat frequently i'll give

933
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:09,679
you two examples of this

934
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:11,040
from the free and open source software

935
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:12,079
licensing world or actually three

936
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:15,359
examples

937
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:16,639
the first is a jacobson v catzer which

938
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:18,480
pam talked a little bit about and i

939
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:19,599
think most of us has probably heard

940
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:21,760
about that

941
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:24,000
and remember that well that's one of the

942
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:26,079
first cases if not the first case

943
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,280
that validated the free and open source

944
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:31,040
licensing

945
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:34,159
model in a court decision and said

946
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:34,800
that the authors have the ability to

947
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:37,040
pursue

948
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:38,639
somebody for violation of the terms of

949
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:41,440
the license

950
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:42,720
what a lot of people may not remember

951
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,918
all those those of us who have been

952
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:47,279
doing this for a while

953
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:51,679
do remember is that that case was

954
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:55,520
really messed up for a long time

955
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:57,119
the input into the system was not good

956
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:58,960
in other words the two parties that were

957
00:34:57,119 --> 00:35:02,240
disputing in that case

958
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:03,760
were not optimal their representatives

959
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:05,680
perhaps may not have been

960
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:06,960
advocating positions that we thought

961
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:09,598
would have been good

962
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:10,000
to get the result that we wanted and in

963
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:12,079
the

964
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:14,079
at least in the district court we got a

965
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:16,320
decision that was

966
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:17,839
contrary what i think most people would

967
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:19,920
prefer to have

968
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:22,560
an interpretation of how uh free and

969
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:25,119
open source software licensing works

970
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:26,560
it was through the efforts of a lot of

971
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:29,119
people

972
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:32,078
putting themselves in front of that

973
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:34,720
litigation and lending assistance

974
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:36,880
to the parties that we did get an

975
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:39,680
appeals court decision

976
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:42,640
that is now useful to all of us in

977
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:45,759
understanding the licenses that we use

978
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:49,520
so that is a first example of

979
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:53,280
a sub-optimal system processing

980
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:57,520
that could have gone the wrong way

981
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:58,960
but for some advantageous actions that

982
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:02,480
were taken

983
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:04,480
and in the end a court that saw

984
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:05,599
things the way that we think they should

985
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:07,760
be seen

986
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:09,200
by the way the court that saw it that

987
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:11,599
way

988
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:13,200
is the exact same court that decided

989
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:16,720
that

990
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:19,520
oracle should win with google so

991
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:20,959
you take what you get from these courts

992
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:23,680
sometimes they find

993
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:25,440
things the way that you like a lot of

994
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:26,399
times they find things the way that you

995
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:29,839
don't like

996
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:32,079
that's part of the system uh

997
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:33,759
two other examples a little bit more

998
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:36,240
recent

999
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:37,359
uh from outside the united states so

1000
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:40,399
mccarty versus

1001
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:44,160
geniatech in germany

1002
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:46,880
and helvig versus vmware

1003
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:47,839
in germany now i don't know if anybody's

1004
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:50,400
read

1005
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:52,480
about these cases either the decisions

1006
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:53,280
or the write-ups of them there's a good

1007
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:56,240
write-up in

1008
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:58,079
jolts the journal that everybody knows i

1009
00:36:56,240 --> 00:37:00,319
promote

1010
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:02,160
regularly every time i open my mouth

1011
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:05,760
there's a good article on the jenny

1012
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:08,879
tech case in jolts from about a year ago

1013
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:10,240
describing how that went down

1014
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:12,320
there has not yet been an article if

1015
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:14,479
somebody's willing to write one on the

1016
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:15,839
vmware case we'd be interested in

1017
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:19,760
publishing it

1018
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:23,839
but the bottom line of those cases is

1019
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:25,119
the courts found what appear or set what

1020
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:28,560
appeared to be

1021
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:31,839
fairly difficult to

1022
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:34,880
meet standards of proof

1023
00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:38,000
for whether you had

1024
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:39,839
copyright rights that you could assert

1025
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:42,640
against somebody that you believe to be

1026
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:42,640
an infringer

1027
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:47,599
that is something i think that is

1028
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:51,279
problematic

1029
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:52,400
for people who want to think about

1030
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:56,079
enforcement

1031
00:37:52,400 --> 00:38:00,240
if the tests are hard

1032
00:37:56,079 --> 00:38:04,800
enforcement gets hard and worse

1033
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:07,680
if the output from the court is

1034
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:09,520
detrimental there's a negative feedback

1035
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:11,839
loop there

1036
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:12,640
the next court takes a look at that and

1037
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:15,200
says

1038
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:17,200
well the test is hard we should make

1039
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,759
this hard for people who come into the

1040
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:22,000
court

1041
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:24,079
and want to enforce that's why

1042
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,680
when you go to the system of enforcement

1043
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:28,880
through litigation

1044
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:31,598
you are taking a risk that

1045
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:32,480
the inputs will be bad the system

1046
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:35,520
processing

1047
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:36,480
will not be predictable the outputs will

1048
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:39,200
be

1049
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,760
unfortunate and there may be a negative

1050
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:44,078
feedback

1051
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:44,079
loop that makes things worse

1052
00:38:44,839 --> 00:38:50,799
so litigation

1053
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:53,359
has where enforcement has its

1054
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:55,920
downsides we need to consider that and

1055
00:38:53,359 --> 00:39:00,640
we need to consider that

1056
00:38:55,920 --> 00:39:03,200
um cases in the future may

1057
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:05,200
come to conclusions about the licenses

1058
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:08,319
that we like

1059
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:09,439
that may be detrimental to the way that

1060
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:14,079
we want

1061
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:17,200
the community of developers to work

1062
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:19,119
i'm not going to steal vans thunder

1063
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:21,118
but the google versus oracle case is

1064
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:23,520
another example

1065
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:24,800
where we need to watch that case

1066
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:28,200
carefully

1067
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:30,640
because it may indeed have some

1068
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:32,640
disadvantageous effects

1069
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:34,960
on the way people are thinking about how

1070
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:38,240
these licenses work

1071
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:40,800
so i'll leave that at that now if if it

1072
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:42,959
ain't broke don't fix it

1073
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:44,320
we've got a big group of people in this

1074
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:46,880
room

1075
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:48,640
i think most of the people here probably

1076
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:52,000
owe their jobs

1077
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:54,879
to non-enforcement

1078
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:56,480
modes of compliance and i think we

1079
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:58,800
should continue to

1080
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:00,480
have people encouraged to work in that

1081
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:03,200
way

1082
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:03,599
okay so now you get to cross-examine me

1083
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:07,118
all right

1084
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:08,480
mark i get to cross an exam

1085
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:10,160
all right so i think we're going with

1086
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:11,359
two questions or at least two questions

1087
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:14,560
that we can remember

1088
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:17,359
um i had three but i actually forgot my

1089
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:17,359
third one as well so

1090
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:24,078
uh all right so my first question is um

1091
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:26,879
so jay completely catcher um

1092
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:28,160
so you said that that could have been a

1093
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:30,160
disaster

1094
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:32,720
until a lot of people engaged and then

1095
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:34,879
we've got a positive results

1096
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:36,879
isn't that an argument for an engaging

1097
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:38,000
enforcement because we got a positive

1098
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:39,440
results

1099
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,200
when the people cared about these

1100
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:43,520
licenses showed up

1101
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:45,439
to help educate the courts about how the

1102
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:46,960
licenses work

1103
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:48,880
and then my second question is going to

1104
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:51,119
be um you said

1105
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:52,400
as long as the system works in the way

1106
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:54,880
that you want it to

1107
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:56,640
that's the right result don't assume

1108
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:57,119
that the system will always work that

1109
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,960
way

1110
00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:00,480
that's my cautionary well so this goes

1111
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:03,760
to my second question then

1112
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:06,240
is um you kind of implied that

1113
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:08,800
we shouldn't do enforcement because

1114
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:14,240
sometimes we might get negative results

1115
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:15,680
and right now we're getting what we want

1116
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:17,680
because there's still the threat of

1117
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:19,118
enforcement but we might if we do too

1118
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:20,640
much enforcement we might suddenly find

1119
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:22,640
out there is no

1120
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:24,240
threat of enforcement would we still

1121
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:28,240
what get what we want if we take

1122
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:29,359
enforcement off the table so i i'm gonna

1123
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:31,598
i'm gonna

1124
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:32,960
echo what pam said which is i'm not sure

1125
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:35,920
that we can

1126
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:36,640
say for certain that enforcement in the

1127
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:40,960
past has

1128
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:44,480
resulted in compliance in the present

1129
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:46,319
nevertheless i think that the way that's

1130
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:48,400
most consistent with the way

1131
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:50,160
the free software free and open source

1132
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:53,359
software movement works

1133
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:55,359
is to go to conferences setups

1134
00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:58,960
compliance programs

1135
00:41:55,359 --> 00:42:02,000
talk train develop

1136
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:04,800
systems internal systems

1137
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:06,000
develop tools in a way so that everybody

1138
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:08,240
can benefit

1139
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:10,319
and that everybody can run their

1140
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:14,078
operations in a way

1141
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:14,400
that is compliant and is consistent with

1142
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:17,520
the

1143
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:19,599
phil's philosophy of the movement

1144
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:21,040
i would advocate and i hope most of you

1145
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:22,560
who owe your jobs that would also

1146
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:25,119
advocate that that's the best way to get

1147
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:25,119
things done

1148
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:34,160
okay so we have

1149
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:36,079
no i rest my case okay now we have

1150
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:38,720
we have uh i think we have 10 minutes

1151
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:38,720
for questions

1152
00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:45,839
yeah we combined the two

1153
00:42:56,839 --> 00:42:59,839
okay

1154
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:05,440
yes we should yes yes okay so

1155
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:06,640
it was very interesting hearing the

1156
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:08,960
positions about whether or not

1157
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:11,279
enforcement of licenses is required

1158
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:12,480
um i'm curious to know if you

1159
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:16,079
collectively

1160
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:19,119
would agree that licenses themselves

1161
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:22,560
are required not necessarily like not

1162
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:22,560
not considering enforcement just the

1163
00:43:24,839 --> 00:43:31,119
licenses

1164
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:33,520
um well in an ideal world

1165
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:35,359
licenses would not be required everybody

1166
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:39,359
would operate in a

1167
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:41,440
a community appropriate way

1168
00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:43,680
i would say that a license and i think

1169
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:44,400
this is the free software foundation has

1170
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:46,240
said this

1171
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:48,640
the license is the constitution of the

1172
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:51,839
movement so it's one way

1173
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:54,240
of outlining expectations for everybody

1174
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:56,640
who's operating in the space

1175
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:59,439
whether or not you actually actuate that

1176
00:43:56,640 --> 00:44:01,759
as a legal document versus a

1177
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:02,960
set of principles you know that goes

1178
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:06,160
into

1179
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:06,160
this enforcement question

1180
00:44:07,359 --> 00:44:12,000
i think licenses are required uh and one

1181
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:13,440
that just happens to be how the legal

1182
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,920
regime that we work under

1183
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:17,599
works if you don't have a license to use

1184
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:20,240
someone else's copyrighted work

1185
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:21,119
you're not allowed to use it however you

1186
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:23,118
articulate

1187
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:24,960
what that license is whether it's

1188
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:27,760
through you know

1189
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:29,680
a passive acquiescence to someone's use

1190
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:30,560
or a casual conversation or a written

1191
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:33,118
document

1192
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:34,240
licenses technically have to be granted

1193
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:35,839
the advantage of

1194
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:37,279
written licenses which might be going

1195
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:39,599
more to your question

1196
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:41,280
is it it adds clarity and certainty it

1197
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:43,280
can be objective and it reduces

1198
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:44,960
misunderstandings and i think it does go

1199
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:46,880
to mccoy's point of right

1200
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:48,160
these licenses in many respects do

1201
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:50,079
operate as

1202
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:51,200
kind of a constitution for projects or

1203
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:53,839
for the movement

1204
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:55,520
um but if they're not clear we need a

1205
00:44:53,839 --> 00:44:56,799
way of bringing about clarity about it

1206
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:59,359
and not everybody

1207
00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:01,280
is going to always agree um and you just

1208
00:44:59,359 --> 00:45:04,880
need to find a way of getting to

1209
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:06,880
clarity about what the relationship is

1210
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:08,720
uh yeah i would agree with that with

1211
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:11,200
sort of the only other

1212
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:12,240
only thing to say in addition to that is

1213
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:14,319
that then

1214
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:16,399
if there were not written licenses then

1215
00:45:14,319 --> 00:45:18,800
the the troll problem

1216
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:21,359
would be much much broader so we see

1217
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:23,119
this happening all the time in

1218
00:45:21,359 --> 00:45:24,799
collaborative communities that work with

1219
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:25,920
unwritten rules is all of a sudden

1220
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:28,240
there's a shift

1221
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:29,760
and someone doesn't follow the unwritten

1222
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:30,799
rules and and creates a lot of

1223
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:32,560
disruption

1224
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:34,319
so the license acts as those written

1225
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:35,839
rules so that everybody has a common

1226
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:37,680
understanding of what's acceptable

1227
00:45:35,839 --> 00:45:40,720
behavior

1228
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:44,000
yeah i just want to point out

1229
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:46,240
that if you don't write any rules so so

1230
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:49,599
if you don't have licenses

1231
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:53,118
lawyers will benefit greatly because

1232
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:56,640
because we'll we will have

1233
00:45:53,119 --> 00:45:59,680
a total ins a certainty and

1234
00:45:56,640 --> 00:46:02,480
coming on mccoy's point if the license

1235
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:05,200
is our constitution then we have to

1236
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:05,200
fight for it

1237
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:12,160
so my question is especially for those

1238
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:14,960
who oppose enforcement

1239
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:16,078
does the time ever get better to to to

1240
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:19,839
do enforcement

1241
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:22,160
can we say uh maybe in 20 years

1242
00:46:19,839 --> 00:46:23,680
some terms will be clearer in the

1243
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:26,720
industry so the courts

1244
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:28,799
will more easily get the right output

1245
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:32,399
from a certain input for instance

1246
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:34,480
or or is the decision let's say forever

1247
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:36,560
so we will not do it even in a century

1248
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:38,160
from now

1249
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:40,640
so i think in your example actually

1250
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:44,399
would be run counter to enforcement

1251
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:47,680
if there were a court out there

1252
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:50,960
the the the the

1253
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:54,480
world court were to say here is how

1254
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:58,720
gpl works for every provision

1255
00:46:54,480 --> 00:47:00,480
in it everybody knows the rules

1256
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:03,680
there's no reason why anybody wouldn't

1257
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:06,560
follow that so i i think in that case

1258
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:07,440
it's less likely to be the subject of

1259
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:11,759
enforcement

1260
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:15,280
the ambiguity tends to

1261
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:15,280
allow people to

1262
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:19,440
raise questions about what the licenses

1263
00:47:18,319 --> 00:47:21,440
mean

1264
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:23,440
so i i you know whether 20 years from

1265
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:25,599
now enforcement will be good or

1266
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:27,119
not good i don't know it's that's hard

1267
00:47:25,599 --> 00:47:28,880
to predict it really depends on a lot of

1268
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:30,079
different circumstances but i'm not so

1269
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:33,359
sure that

1270
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:36,640
more court decisions will i think more

1271
00:47:33,359 --> 00:47:38,319
clarity in court decisions will

1272
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:41,279
put the road map out for everybody on

1273
00:47:38,319 --> 00:47:41,279
how they need to operate

1274
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:46,880
do you want to respond to a family no no

1275
00:47:51,359 --> 00:47:58,240
so this is a two-parter the first is

1276
00:47:55,040 --> 00:48:00,720
do you believe that proprietary licenses

1277
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:02,078
are there is a culture of the

1278
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:04,000
expectation of enforcement of

1279
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:07,440
proprietary licenses

1280
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:10,000
and number two if you agree with that

1281
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:12,319
why do you believe uh free and open

1282
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:16,640
source licenses should be any different

1283
00:48:12,319 --> 00:48:18,558
that's for the people that's foreign

1284
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:23,279
actually

1285
00:48:18,559 --> 00:48:25,920
start with the uh um

1286
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:28,400
i think there probably is an expectation

1287
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:30,240
that propriety licenses will be enforced

1288
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:31,440
uh more readily than free software

1289
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:34,558
licenses

1290
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:36,160
i i suspect it's probably because

1291
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:37,839
we just think companies are willing to

1292
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:40,960
be more litigious and

1293
00:48:37,839 --> 00:48:42,960
free software is made by individuals

1294
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:45,599
who are less sophisticated when it comes

1295
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:47,440
to litigation and commercial dealings

1296
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:48,880
um which i don't think is actually it's

1297
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:50,640
that's just not true right like free

1298
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:52,480
software is produced by large companies

1299
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:54,799
that are very sophisticated

1300
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:56,480
um so that expectation might be out

1301
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:58,480
there at the same time too

1302
00:48:56,480 --> 00:49:00,319
i also think that the expectation that

1303
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:02,400
propriety licenses will

1304
00:49:00,319 --> 00:49:03,759
be enforced they're not enforced quickly

1305
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:05,599
it's not like everyone who bought

1306
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:07,040
proprietary software got sued by the

1307
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:08,960
manufacturer

1308
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:10,240
nor is it true that they were all in

1309
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:12,640
compliance

1310
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:13,919
um i think the fact that there's that

1311
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:16,558
expectation of differences

1312
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:17,839
is a problem and to a disadvantage of

1313
00:49:16,559 --> 00:49:20,000
the community though right is that

1314
00:49:17,839 --> 00:49:22,400
somehow the community should be

1315
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:23,839
above doing litigation but it's okay for

1316
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:25,200
companies to do it on their proprietary

1317
00:49:23,839 --> 00:49:28,839
licenses why should we give the

1318
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:31,680
proprietary license manufacturers that

1319
00:49:28,839 --> 00:49:34,799
advantage

1320
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:35,598
um i actually uh disagree with the

1321
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:37,119
premise that

1322
00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:38,640
there's more enforcement going on in

1323
00:49:37,119 --> 00:49:40,800
proprietary licenses

1324
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:41,759
i think yeah mccoy's nodding his head i

1325
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:44,160
think that that

1326
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:46,240
um the companies that are doing

1327
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:48,240
enforcement work on copyright licenses

1328
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:49,359
the very last thing they want to do is

1329
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:50,959
sue a customer

1330
00:49:49,359 --> 00:49:52,799
and they will only do it if it's already

1331
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:54,240
a lost cause if it's already

1332
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:59,200
and and there's a lot of money involved

1333
00:49:54,240 --> 00:50:02,319
that can be recouped but if um

1334
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:02,720
well yeah um yeah and there but but

1335
00:50:02,319 --> 00:50:04,400
really

1336
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:06,160
you know they would much rather have a

1337
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:07,440
paying customer who's paying a bit more

1338
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:08,879
because they've convinced them

1339
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:10,240
that their non-compliance really means

1340
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:11,680
they should be coughing up a little more

1341
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:12,078
money than they are now but they much

1342
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:14,640
rather

1343
00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:15,280
keep that keep that customer and and

1344
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:17,920
write off

1345
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:19,599
the loss rather than lose the customer

1346
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:20,480
entirely and lose all income from that

1347
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:22,240
customer so

1348
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:24,000
so i kind of i don't think that

1349
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:25,359
proprietary companies have a culture of

1350
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,839
enforcement i think it is just the

1351
00:50:25,359 --> 00:50:27,839
opposite

1352
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:33,460

1354
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:38,000
hello

1355
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:46,000
thanks for all that um do you think that

1356
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:49,359
enforcement and litigation as you

1357
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:52,880
narrow it down does it uh

1358
00:50:49,359 --> 00:50:56,000
is it working on license by license case

1359
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:58,720
so if in the future that we said that

1360
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:59,839
maybe in 20 years time some court has

1361
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:02,879
already

1362
00:50:59,839 --> 00:51:06,000
defined all the points of gpl

1363
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:06,400
but maybe then we should all have moved

1364
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,520
to

1365
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:12,559
another license which is still ambiguous

1366
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:15,200
by then or do you think that

1367
00:51:12,559 --> 00:51:16,160
results of uh enforcements and

1368
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:19,279
litigations

1369
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:23,040
apply to everything is that for one side

1370
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:26,160
one particular side or the other

1371
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:26,160
anybody want to take that

1372
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:36,799
so litigations over let's say gpl2

1373
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:37,839
may have an effect on future licenses

1374
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:41,119
gpl v4

1375
00:51:37,839 --> 00:51:44,160
or whatever because in many cases these

1376
00:51:41,119 --> 00:51:46,640
these litigations the the courts are

1377
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:48,879
setting out general principles and not

1378
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:52,720
necessarily

1379
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:54,800
limiting the decision to the exact text

1380
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:56,959
that's why oracle v google is an

1381
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:58,960
important case to

1382
00:51:56,960 --> 00:52:00,800
things other than java and that's why

1383
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:02,800
people care about it right because they

1384
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:04,480
anticipate the people who are arguing

1385
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:07,520
about it or anticipate that it's going

1386
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:10,400
to set the rules for how we interpret

1387
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:11,680
uh what's copyrightable in software

1388
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:15,839
generically

1389
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:15,839
so i i think that answers your question

1390
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:22,800
okay we have time for more responses

1391
00:52:20,319 --> 00:52:23,920
just a very just a very very quick

1392
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:27,200
comment on this

1393
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:29,520
i mean every decision may have an impact

1394
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:31,839
on future licenses and of course it

1395
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:33,839
depends on the license being litigated

1396
00:52:31,839 --> 00:52:36,240
theoretically you could enforce us a bit

1397
00:52:33,839 --> 00:52:38,960
where license but i don't think that

1398
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:40,000
enforcing a video license may may have

1399
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:43,359
an impact on

1400
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:45,520
from future licensing okay

1401
00:52:43,359 --> 00:52:46,880
so i know but i don't think we have time

1402
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:47,759
for because there's one okay so what we

1403
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:51,200
need to do

1404
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:53,359
is for your debaters raise your hand

1405
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:54,240
if you mostly agree with the position

1406
00:52:53,359 --> 00:52:57,359
that you took

1407
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:57,919
in the debate raise your hand if you

1408
00:52:57,359 --> 00:52:59,119
don't want to

1409
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:00,480
if you don't want to raise your hand you

1410
00:52:59,119 --> 00:53:01,119
don't want to say whether you do or you

1411
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:02,319
don't

1412
00:53:01,119 --> 00:53:04,640
it doesn't matter you know what you all

1413
00:53:02,319 --> 00:53:08,160
did an excellent job so what weird

1414
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:10,640
so what's a plus yeah we will okay now

1415
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:12,720
we are not having we are not having

1416
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:15,759
formal judging of these debates

1417
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:17,200
however what i want to know is so wait

1418

okay so what i want to know is

1420
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:28,558
for the people against enforcement

1421
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:29,920
raise your hand if they brought up

1422
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:32,319
something you hadn't thought about

1423
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:32,319
before

1424
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:36,880
okay and those four enforcement

1425
00:53:35,839 --> 00:53:37,920
raise your hand if they brought up

1426
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:39,200
something you hadn't thought about

1427
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:43,040
before
