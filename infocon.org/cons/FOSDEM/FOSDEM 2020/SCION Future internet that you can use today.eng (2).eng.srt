1
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:08,480
okay

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:09,280
just a bit of statistics does any one of

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,280
you have been

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,559
yesterday to the same talk but in the

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,480
longer version

6
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:16,400
okay not so many people so it will be

7
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,680
the same but i will do it in 10 minutes

8
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:20,959
instead of 50 so

9
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:22,400
probably everyone will enjoy okay so

10
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,000
long story short we're trying to

11
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:27,038
redesign internet of course because

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,720
everyone wants to do it we are kind of

13
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:31,199
academics because i'm coming

14
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:32,159
from eth suring but also we have a

15
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:35,120
spinoff which is

16
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:35,919
now doing this for for real so for

17
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,399
people

18
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,800
um to to really use it and it's

19
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,680
something usable so it's not just a next

20
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,919
you know

21
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,800
wish nice dream which has nothing to do

22
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,320
with reality

23
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,160
but but really have something working

24
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,000
that's why i want to present this

25
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:52,640
i will skip this slide because of the

26
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
timing so what you are doing

27
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,000
so of course we are designing the new

28
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,600
internet because there is fundamental

29
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,120
problem with the current internet which

30
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,559
i will show you in the next

31
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:04,239
um slide we are doing this in a very

32
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:06,320
clean state which means we get rid of

33
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:07,200
what you have currently and we redesign

34
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,679
it

35
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,920
not to be too much of a revolutionist we

36
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,439
are trying to make it working on the

37
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,400
current infrastructure also

38
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:16,320
so you're going to have mixed

39
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,280
deployments so you do not really need to

40
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,919
redesign

41
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,840
all your infrastructure at once because

42
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,159
this is money and probably

43
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,400
it's nice but you won't do it in reality

44
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:28,159
so you want to have a solution that you

45
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,560
can use from

46
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:32,400
from right now so this is one of the

47
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,479
snapshots of the articles from wired

48
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,400
yeah infrastructure mess causing

49
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:37,840
countless internet outages you can see

50
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,079
it every month

51
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,759
so bgp causes problems in general

52
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:44,240
routing causes problems

53
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,360
and if you go into the whole network

54
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,600
stuck layer four

55
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,600
is in general causing a lot of problems

56
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,360
because people either use it incorrectly

57
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:55,039
or people do not know how to use it

58
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:57,759
or it's been designed 50 years ago and

59
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,640
yeah it covers different use cases

60
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:00,399
because at the

61
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,560
at the time when internet was originally

62
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:04,719
designed everything was super simple so

63
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:07,600
your computer it was just a machine for

64
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:09,440
for sending mails nothing more but right

65
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,478
now we have really smart devices so all

66
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,959
the iot

67
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:14,480
blockchains all these fancy buzzwords

68
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,319
this really needs

69
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:18,879
different concepts different approach to

70
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:20,720
privacy to how we treat data our restore

71
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:23,280
data who has access to data

72
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:25,200
and all these kind of things so we are

73
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:28,560
creating a new protocol

74
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:30,319
a new set of protocols just a bunch of

75
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,120
buzzwords around control failure

76
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:32,560
isolation

77
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,640
trust information end-to-end

78
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,000
communication these are just buzzwords

79
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,958
let me explain a bit more

80
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,959
what we are trying to do so route

81
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:42,080
control the fundamental problem i have

82
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,480
with bgp is that

83
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,200
you as the end user i as the end user i

84
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:48,079
have

85
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,879
completely no control of how my data

86
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,480
flows

87
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:52,480
where it goes i can only specify the

88
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,200
destination but i have no idea what

89
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,879
happens

90
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,879
every half year i think there is

91
00:02:54,879 --> 00:03:00,000
something yeah i will try putting it

92
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:02,239
a bit like this maybe it will be better

93
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
so every half a year you can read

94
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:07,360
articles china steals

95
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,400
data or data flows through pakistan even

96
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,159
though it shouldn't

97
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,920
and all this kind of stuff something

98
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:13,200
some time ago in switzerland we had a

99
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,920
problem so the traffic which was

100
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,760
supposed to

101
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,359
only stay in the country was going

102
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,440
through russia and china and there you

103
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,200
know i'm asking why why does it happen

104
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,440
because there is no fundamental reason

105
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,958
if i'm sending some message to a dude on

106
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,879
the other side of the street over the

107
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:27,440
internet i wanted to go with the short

108
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:31,359
path

109
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:33,760
not through the other continent so yeah

110
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,959
um what what you are trying to provide

111
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,200
this is the very first

112
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:38,959
like fundamental for this dev room so

113
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:41,440
with decentralized drought

114
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:42,959
we decentralized routing so there is no

115
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,200
entities on the way

116
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,560
which control what happens to your data

117
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,560
you control it so you can see with

118
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,959
different colors we have two computers

119
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,840
and we want to send data between them so

120
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:53,920
you select

121
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,519
how the stream goes you select the path

122
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,879
based on different incentives do you

123
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:57,439
want it to be high throughput do you

124
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:59,518
want it

125
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:01,760
to be super secure because it goes only

126
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:04,879
through isps which provide you

127
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:06,798
the best trust of course there is kind

128
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:07,920
of money aspect because some paths they

129
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:09,920
can be

130
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:12,319
they can be cheaper the other ones can

131
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:15,359
be more expensive different properties

132
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:19,599
but also what we want to achieve is very

133
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:22,960
fast failure resistance to failure

134
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:24,479
so i'm always bitching on bgp and bfd

135
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,280
because i work with this and i do not

136
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:27,280
like it because

137
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,719
it doesn't work properly in flaky

138
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:31,198
network environments

139
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,000
so by offloading this to user to the

140
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,440
application

141
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,440
you have the possibility to react

142
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,880
immediately to any change in the network

143
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,400
you do not need to wait for all the

144
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:41,600
routers to converge

145
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,000
and whatever happens in between because

146
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,919
you don't

147
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,600
know what happens so you know it's just

148
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:46,639
a matter of trust you trust this guy

149
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,560
selling you internet

150
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:50,560
that they do what they think is good for

151
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,560
you but this is not always

152
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,479
always the case yeah so path control you

153
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,759
select the path i i won't go into

154
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:56,080
details i just want to highlight for

155
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:58,720
people

156
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:00,479
knowing this stuff this is not this is

157
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,240
not source routing this is a

158
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:03,919
fundamentally different concept because

159
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,680
you select the whole path

160
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:07,280
routers they just follow instructions

161
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,800
routers are stateless

162
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,239
which also means from performance

163
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,680
perspective it's probably not super

164
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,840
interesting for this devrum

165
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,199
but you do not need to parse so much

166
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,520
stuff from the packet because you just

167
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:17,520
check

168
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,198
where to send it next thank you it's

169
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,919
done and also

170
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:24,000
the policies are and are enforced in

171
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:25,599
your local neighborhood

172
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,520
which means we have the concept of

173
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,680
isolation domains it can be

174
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,359
your city your company your country

175
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,280
depends how you want to design it

176
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,600
the main point is you do not need to

177
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:38,000
trust everyone in the network you only

178
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:40,320
need to trust your isolation domain

179
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,680
so if i build isolation domain for my

180
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,919
family

181
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:46,160
my father my mother my grandma my dog

182
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:47,359
they do not need to trust my isp and a

183
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,240
bunch of other dudes

184
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:52,400
they only need to trust me as the isd so

185
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:55,360
all the certificates all this

186
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,719
all this kind of stuff it happens in in

187
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,120
this very local

188
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,800
environment i do not need to trust some

189
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,520
global roots somewhere

190
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,520
out there

191
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,359
and yeah the different features

192
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,560
scalability because routers are

193
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,360
stateless and we have

194
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:13,759
the this kind of hierarchical routing

195
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,680
you do not have the super huge routing

196
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:18,080
tables which you can easily mess with

197
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,039
and just make your traffic to behave

198
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,520
very incorrectly

199
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:23,199
we have native multipath so this can be

200
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:25,120
a nice feature for

201
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:26,560
some people because you can just use

202
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,639
your infrastructure better

203
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,319
and you also can control your data more

204
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:32,240
because if you go multi-path

205
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:34,240
even if something went wrong even if

206
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,880
some isp on the way

207
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,759
goes crazy goes wrong it doesn't have

208
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,759
all the data

209
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:40,960
and photo runs this is what i said by

210
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:43,600
offloading this and doing

211
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:45,120
kind of ikea do-it-yourself style you

212
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,720
have more control because you as a

213
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,599
developer you can decide what

214
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,400
is what is good for you how to behave in

215
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:53,199
case of

216
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:56,000
some problems yes i tested my demo but i

217
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:58,880
will not show you this

218
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,319
okay just yeah i won't describe details

219
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:03,120
just we have two separate

220
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:04,960
networks running already so this is used

221
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,880
both by researchers around the world but

222
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,520
this is also used already by swiss

223
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,680
government

224
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:11,919
and swiss national bank so it's not just

225
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:14,240
a bunch of guys at university doing

226
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:16,400
something for fun this is really used

227
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,400
for more than two years now for mission

228
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,120
critical workload of swiss national

229
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,440
banks so

230
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,880
if they trust i mean switzerland finance

231
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:25,280
banking all this kind of

232
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:27,520
stuff if they if they trust it i would

233
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:29,520
use it

234
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,120
okay so how can i run it because i'm

235
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,840
saying like very very high level

236
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,919
overview

237
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,679
but i want to sell you the point this is

238
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:37,520
super easy to run we run on

239
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,599
any commodity server you do not need

240
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:41,440
cisco juniper or these guys

241
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:43,680
to build super expensive switches and

242
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:46,000
routers for you this is a very standard

243
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,599
64-bit architecture you can take your pc

244
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,680
your laptop whatever you want

245
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:51,919
even raspberry pi and you can run as

246
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:54,639
part of infrastructure on this device

247
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:55,520
and i said at the very beginning we have

248
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:57,199
we have a

249
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,719
possibility of doing mixed deployments

250
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:01,360
because of course if we told everyone

251
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:04,639
now you need to redesign from scratch

252
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:06,400
people wouldn't be able to to join this

253
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:07,919
to to join this party because they will

254
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,840
say okay but we need to invest

255
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:11,280
so much money and maybe there is some

256
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:13,679
gain maybe there is not

257
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:16,239
it's too risky so we are trying to make

258
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:18,479
it super easy to join on top of current

259
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:21,759
stuff you have test it and if you are

260
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:23,599
happy push your isp push your

261
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:25,520
i.t departments whatever you name it

262
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:28,080
this kind of you know corporate

263
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,878
and move forward to the native

264
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,400
deployment

265
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:32,399
yeah we have some hello world you can go

266
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:34,319
through slides later in github we have

267
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:38,000
more serious applications using

268
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:39,599
natively scion yes we we are very happy

269
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,839
to see different use cases because we

270
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:44,480
have some but also

271
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:45,680
downstream contributors they are always

272
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,080
super appreciated

273
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,920
because you people always invent kind of

274
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:53,200
use cases solutions problems

275
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:56,000
which we wouldn't even think about yes

276
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:58,640
i would show the next demo but no and a

277
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:09,839
bunch of links if if you are interested

278
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:09,839
and yes thank you

279
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,320
you
