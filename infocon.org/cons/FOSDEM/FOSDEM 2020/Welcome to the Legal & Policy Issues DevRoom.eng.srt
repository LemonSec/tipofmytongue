1
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:11,360
good morning

2
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:16,239
and welcome to the legal and policy

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:17,919
issue to that dev room

4
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:19,840
you're very you're very courageous to

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,439
come out this early and you've made it

6
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,960
all the way to this building which means

7
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:25,279
you're really highly motivated so thank

8
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:29,199
you so much for coming

9
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:31,840
this is the ninth year that we've done

10
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:31,840
this dev room

11
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:40,000
and uh we're really excited this year to

12
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,719
try a couple of new things you know

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,760
we've

14
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:46,079
often had fascinating

15
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:47,599
talks here and we thought we would try

16
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,320
to push ourselves and do

17
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:52,399
some new things so one of the new things

18
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,559
we're going to do

19
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:55,600
is have some working collaboration

20
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:57,519
sessions

21
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,920
we'll have two of those where we're

22
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:02,960
going to collaboratively try to

23
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:05,040
think about how to address some of the

24
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,320
legal and policy issues that we have in

25
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,400
our community

26
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,919
and i hope and encourage all of you to

27
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,560
participate

28
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,280
and then we're also having several

29
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,880
debates

30
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:18,400
today and so the idea it's a brand new

31
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:21,119
thing that we've never done before and

32
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:24,560
the idea here is to give you

33
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:26,720
two different sides of some very

34
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,080
interesting questions that are facing

35
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:31,600
our community and

36
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,960
the goal is to inform you very deeply

37
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,360
about the positions

38
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,399
that may be held on either side of the

39
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,880
debate

40
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,400
um so we're really looking forward to

41
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,320
that it's important for me to make the

42
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,399
disclaimer however that the debaters

43
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:46,639
that are presenting and the debates

44
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:48,000
may or may not hold that particular

45
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,600
point of view they're just taking that

46
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,320
point of view for the sake of the debate

47
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,399
so just

48
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:55,119
keep that in mind while you're while

49
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:58,880
you're listening to the debates

50
00:01:55,119 --> 00:02:00,719
uh as usual we have a very busy day so

51
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,880
we're going to do our best to keep on

52
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:05,600
schedule

53
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,399
and uh we have a couple of audio video

54
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,280
challenges but

55
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:09,919
that's to be expected so uh please you

56
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,599
know

57
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:13,359
give our speakers a little bit of

58
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:17,040
flexibility as we work through

59
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:19,280
