1
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:10,080
all right let's get started

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,559
um welcome to s linux fun with mysql and

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,639
friends

4
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:14,000
as you can see i'm missing a co-speaker

5
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:14,719
if i unfortunately couldn't make it

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,960
today

7
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:18,560
he's in south america and he couldn't

8
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,240
get approval to come here

9
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,240
but he did help me prepare this slide so

10
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:24,640
we left his name on there

11
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:26,720
so quickly who we are my name is

12
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,400
matthias kowals i live here in belgium i

13
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,080
live in ghent

14
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,960
i'm back in computer science been a

15
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:34,640
linux user and admin for over 20 years

16
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,120
then i've been a php developer in the

17
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:40,719
start of my career for about 10 years

18
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:42,480
and since 80 years i'm my skull dba

19
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:45,520
currently i'm a lead database consultant

20
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,398
at pythian ivan lives in argentina in

21
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,360
south america

22
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:51,520
as a systems engineer unfortunately he

23
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:54,559
also has left pity and is now

24
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:59,120
a senior consultant at barcona

25
00:00:54,559 --> 00:01:01,760
um this is something about pity and yeah

26
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:03,038
one disclaimer i'm not going to claim

27
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,679
here that i'm the

28
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:07,600
asset links guru i'm just a dba having

29
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,600
to deal with sl linux on systems that

30
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:12,960
are managed by other people

31
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,798
and this is the presentation goes about

32
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,559
how we go about that and what we did

33
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:19,520
what we learned about

34
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,080
dealing with those kinds of situations

35
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,320
so

36
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:24,479
let's get started with some introduction

37
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,000
to what sll linux is

38
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:27,600
so this is the definition you can find

39
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,520
on wikipedia

40
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:33,280
it's something because someone thought

41
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:36,158
that the normal linux

42
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,600
security system wasn't good enough so we

43
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:40,240
actually have the privileges for users

44
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:42,559
groups and others

45
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:44,158
but it wasn't granular enough it's

46
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,360
originally developed by the nsa in

47
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:49,040
america

48
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:51,680
and red hat and it's distribute to your

49
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:54,240
kernel as a set of kernel modules

50
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:56,720
for enhanced security or for bothering

51
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,720
dbas

52
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,960
there are three modes to se linux and

53
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:03,360
it's very similar to what nick earlier

54
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,640
said

55
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:09,280
in his presentation about proxy sql

56
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,919
the default mode is set to enforcing in

57
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,200
red that's

58
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:14,160
enterprise linux and phantos you can set

59
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,720
it to permissive

60
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:18,239
or disabled permissive does what it says

61
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,879
it will

62
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:22,400
track every all the settings for slms

63
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:23,760
but it will allow them but it will lock

64
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,840
them in the log file

65
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,040
and disable tool just completely disable

66
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:30,239
so linux

67
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:33,920
and a weizmann one set every time you

68
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:33,920
disable let's linux kitten dies

69
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:40,319
think of the kittens um

70
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,760
the truth is mostly the compliance or

71
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:44,319
security teams will bite you if you

72
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,319
disable it

73
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,399
um it's often a part of their other

74
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,640
trails

75
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,599
they want the logging at least or they

76
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,359
want to block

77
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:54,959
everything they don't allow which is

78
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,760
also the default policy

79
00:02:54,959 --> 00:03:00,640
so there's a deny policy for anything

80
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:04,399
you don't specifically allow

81
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:05,920
a useful tool on a red hat

82
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,319
enterprise linux based system or

83
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:11,440
centos-based system is policy

84
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:13,359
core utils in python and it provides a

85
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,200
lot of tools to manage and define your

86
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,239
asset links policies if you want to go a

87
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,480
little bit deeper and

88
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:19,280
really start writing policies the devil

89
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:23,280
package

90
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:25,040
gives you a lot more tools also

91
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,959
and how you can check it so there's a

92
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,720
tool seo essay status

93
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,799
and you can run that and it will show

94
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:32,239
you the current modes like in this case

95
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:36,400
it was

96
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:39,760
enforcing um it's enabled

97
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:42,799
and these are the the config directories

98
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:44,480
uh you can get in force

99
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:46,560
you can do get enforced to see what the

100
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,640
status is of the enforcement

101
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,560
and remember the kittens here because i

102
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:53,359
made this the screenshot

103
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,360
i killed the kitten

104
00:03:54,080 --> 00:04:00,959
so seo linux is defined by users policy

105
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:03,280
contacts there's

106
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:05,920
another one-on-one mapping between uh

107
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:08,720
linux users and s linux users

108
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:10,238
so the seo linux users by default here

109
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:12,959
in this system

110
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:13,760
you can get by sa minus user l and then

111
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:16,079
you get all the s

112
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:17,599
linux users you have guest roots stuff a

113
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,840
regular user

114
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:22,479
and you can then assign a login so in

115
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:27,039
this case i just i assigned user john

116
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:29,440
to my as user as a linux user

117
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,400
and then you can see that this john user

118
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,600
is is there

119
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,719
and the default is that they are

120
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:37,040
unconfined so it's very

121
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:39,120
straightforward very easy to track or

122
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:41,919
something here

123
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,880
and also seo linux adds a dash capital z

124
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:45,599
option to

125
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:47,600
commands like ls or ps so you can see

126
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:52,000
what

127
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:55,040
s linux users and object roles and

128
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,080
types it uses and also for a process you

129
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:59,440
can see mysql

130
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:02,240
d is running as uh the

131
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:04,160
the type my my sequel the underscore t

132
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:07,600
and my sequel the save is running as

133
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:09,360
uh basically safe underscore t

134
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,600
and so the contexts are defined as user

135
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:14,320
role type and then a level

136
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:16,639
the most use that i have seen from it is

137
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:19,680
we're using user and type a role

138
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:20,320
is usually like a system object or

139
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,400
system

140
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:24,080
r or something like that a level is if

141
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,799
you want to go even more granular you

142
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,719
can

143
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,160
start doing like this user has access

144
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:31,280
level to these sl

145
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:33,840
levels and you can go up to more

146
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,559
more and more levels but that takes us a

147
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:40,400
bit too far

148
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:42,479
if we so mysql and seo linux

149
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,080
um out of the box experience is that is

150
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:47,120
so that everything works so if you

151
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:49,198
just install yum install mysql server

152
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:52,479
which gives you muradb server

153
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:54,960
or if you do a mysql community server

154
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:55,520
everything will work so there's a module

155
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,719
pretty

156
00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:00,240
a policy predefined you can do sa manage

157
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:03,199
module l and then you could grab for

158
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:06,160
mysql so you see that the mysql

159
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:06,960
object is there by default and it's very

160
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,840
granules

161
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:11,198
granular so you have a lot of different

162
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,280
types that are defined

163
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:16,400
for different locations so in in the

164
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:18,479
etsy mysql it's it's my skill the etsy

165
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:20,318
then you have the log directory the data

166
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:23,599
directory has its own

167
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:27,039
uh the mysql d process has its own

168
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:29,919
uh context and everything so it's it's

169
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:32,960
very granularly defined and you can then

170
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:35,520
start playing with it so in this case

171
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:37,440
this example we wanted to change the the

172
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,799
data directory so the default is farley

173
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,560
mysql and

174
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,479
somehow we were requested to put it on

175
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,880
data mysql

176
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:46,800
and so we made the directory we gave it

177
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,479
to permissions

178
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,240
and you can see here by default it's

179
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:52,880
unconfined

180
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,880
um and we started mariadb service and it

181
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:57,520
didn't start

182
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:59,599
so what we used to do was turn us to

183
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:02,639
linux off and then it worked

184
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:04,080
but remember the kittens so there's an

185
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:06,160
audit log

186
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:07,280
and if you install that that python that

187
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:11,840
python package that i

188
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:14,960
refer to you can do audit to allow and w

189
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:18,479
w a will give you

190
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:21,599
the list of things it's denied for you

191
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:25,039
so um in this case it says i unite

192
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:27,840
right to uh the location i tried to

193
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:30,479
writing with my sequel the

194
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:32,880
context and you are writing to defaulty

195
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:34,880
so it's not allowed

196
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:37,039
and it's it's true because this is by

197
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:40,080
default default type

198
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:41,840
and so you cannot write to that with s

199
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:44,960
linux enforced

200
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:46,878
um so we were then finding the right

201
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:49,120
data directory context so

202
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:50,000
on var lip mysql this is the default

203
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,160
context

204
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,680
so we were trying to just set the

205
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:57,120
context uh to

206
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:58,000
the the directory context and that we

207
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,400
did an ls again

208
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,639
and hey wait we changed this but it

209
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:04,239
didn't change anything

210
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:06,319
so you still have to apply that if you

211
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:08,479
change that something we learned

212
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,680
if you do then restore con and feed

213
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:11,199
gives you useful output

214
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:15,199
so it shows you what it's actually

215
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:17,440
changing then it will start changing the

216
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:18,400
types and now you can see that it has

217
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,000
the right type

218
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,080
and if you now start the server or get

219
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,800
the status you can see that it's active

220
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,280
running

221
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,440
with the right data directory as you as

222
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:30,960
you were expecting to

223
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:34,240
so this is one way of dealing with it

224
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:35,919
another thing is custom ports so we had

225
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,799
a running mysql instance and we just

226
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:42,640
wanted to change this from 3206 to 327

227
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:44,560
so what we did added ports equals 307 to

228
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:48,160
the mysql d section of the config

229
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:51,199
restart it and boom it didn't start

230
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:53,439
why didn't it start so you check journal

231
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,880
ctl there's

232
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,480
it says it doesn't start it has a

233
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:59,040
failure but it doesn't say why

234
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,480
the error lock says permission denied do

235
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,519
you have another process running on that

236
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,950
port

237
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:04,880
no we don't

238
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:07,200
[Laughter]

239
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:08,080
so obviously as the linux was bothering

240
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,000
us there

241
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:12,480
so again if you do the audit lock you

242
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,680
can see that it is trying to use an

243
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,160
unreserved port

244
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,880
and it gives you a possible solution so

245
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:20,319
it says you

246
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:20,720
you allow nis enabled and nice enabled

247
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,839
will

248
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:26,800
allow a process to bind to any port

249
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:27,680
and so if you if you set that as a linux

250
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,839
boolean

251
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,120
it starts and it binds to the port it

252
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:34,480
works

253
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:36,240
but the compliance team may or may not

254
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,920
like that level of freedom to give it to

255
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:41,040
you

256
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:42,640
so another way you can go about it is as

257
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:45,279
the linux manages the port so

258
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,680
if you do if you grab the mysql port

259
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:49,360
from

260
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:51,120
port l in essay manage you see that it

261
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,720
has a number of ports predefined three

262
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,640
to a six is part of it

263
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,160
and you can just add three to seven to

264
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:58,959
that list by doing

265
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:00,399
sa manage port dash a for add to the

266
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:05,599
type mysql the

267
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:07,680
uh t port t and then you give it tcp 307

268
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,120
and then it adds it to that list and

269
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,160
then you can just restart the database

270
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,800
server and now it starts with

271
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:16,000
portraiture 7.

272
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:18,319
so that is just uh examples of

273
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,959
things we run into while dealing with it

274
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:23,040
and how we try to work around it

275
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:24,959
uh without getting the compliance teams

276
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:27,760
on our necks or um

277
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:29,040
getting us in trouble for for disabling

278
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:31,920
things or

279
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:33,279
changing booleans and all those kind of

280
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:37,360
things

281
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:40,880
so another friend of mysql is proxy sql

282
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:44,640
nick just presented about 2.0 um

283
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:48,079
and we also use proxy skill quite often

284
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:50,480
and also by default it works

285
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:52,079
so if you have selling status enabled

286
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:55,760
enforcing everything

287
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:58,239
uh it works it runs but it's also

288
00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:00,000
it's running as an unconfined service

289
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:03,040
and it's running with the default

290
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,959
privileges for varlipt

291
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,719
um where the default type directory for

292
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:10,319
proxy's kevlis

293
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:11,519
um so why should we bother it works out

294
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,880
of the box

295
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:17,040
in our case the log rotation failed so

296
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:18,399
we have log rotate rotating the proxy

297
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:21,519
sql logs

298
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:23,200
and if i run this as root it worked i

299
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:26,720
defined my proxy sql

300
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:29,760
log rotate config

301
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:33,519
and i tested it and everything worked

302
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:37,279
until until chrome started running it

303
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:40,320
chrome runs and it says it starts

304
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:43,680
i start log rotate proxy sql

305
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:47,360
and it exited abnormally with status 1.

306
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:49,920
so why if we do the

307
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,639
this default system has it's mailing to

308
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:54,000
varwa

309
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:57,839
mail root and so it says error renaming

310
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,839
my 2 log file 2.3

311
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:04,800
why it says permission denied uh

312
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:05,200
if if we if we try it as root it works

313
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:08,319
but

314
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:10,160
if we try it in crontab it doesn't so it

315
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,639
has roots we can just

316
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:14,160
run the lock rotate we can get all the

317
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:15,120
output it does everything everything

318
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,600
works

319
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,639
but chron doesn't let us so if we go

320
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,680
back to that

321
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:24,720
this audit log and we see

322
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:26,880
um it tries to

323
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:28,240
write this file but it's it's it's try

324
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:31,839
to rename this file

325
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:34,480
uh so it's not allowed so in this case

326
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:37,519
you can use also the audit allow

327
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,160
uh tool to generate a proxy a policy for

328
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:41,279
that

329
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:42,000
so if you do other to allow on on the

330
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:44,399
log file

331
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,079
so here is the the same command we did

332
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:48,320
for that audit log

333
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:49,519
this this just prints the output on the

334
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,560
on the screen

335
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:53,360
uh if you do dash m proxy sql into a

336
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,920
file

337
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,720
it generates this file for you the

338
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,800
problem is

339
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,079
in this case it only generated for the

340
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:02,479
one error it saw

341
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:03,120
so it saw one error the rename but

342
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,800
there's

343
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,160
multiple things that low rotate to loot

344
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,760
will create new files

345
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,360
it will rename files it will delete

346
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:11,200
files if you if it if

347
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,880
they are expired so it needs more

348
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,959
privileges

349
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,560
so these are the commands you can do

350
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:19,760
then to

351
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:21,439
compile this dot te file into an actual

352
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,480
module file that you can load and

353
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,800
package

354
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:26,880
before it gets loaded into the kernel so

355
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:29,279
at the end you have the module loaded

356
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:30,160
uh version 1.0 which is the version we

357
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:31,439
defined here

358
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:33,199
so if you define a different version

359
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:35,839
there it gets different version number

360
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,839
down here

361
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,480
so as i said this only just allows for

362
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,639
rename so

363
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:45,199
more more iterations of the same process

364
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:49,120
are required to make this work

365
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:50,160
um an easy way an easier way to to get

366
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,079
to this is to set

367
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:54,240
slings temporarily to permissive so you

368
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:55,519
can see what it will do it will allow it

369
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,519
will lock everything

370
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:58,880
and then you can run the process

371
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:00,480
obviously there's

372
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:02,000
it doesn't do all the operations it

373
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:05,120
might do in the in a single

374
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,920
run so if in my case i was only at my

375
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,519
third or

376
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,959
second or third iteration and i want to

377
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:11,040
keep five log files

378
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:12,719
so it only when it reaches the fifth log

379
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:15,120
files will start deleting

380
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:18,160
so you have to run make sure that you

381
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:20,639
have the entire process that it will do

382
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,639
it possible

383
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:30,880
no oh yeah the question was

384
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,920
can you set asides permissive only for a

385
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:34,560
specific process

386
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:36,719
the answer is no not as far as i know

387
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,719
but

388
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:43,680
um so if if you then have the entire

389
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:44,319
list of things it can do in the audit

390
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:48,079
log

391
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:50,240
then you can generate the the full file

392
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:52,239
that you end up with and then it looks

393
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,480
something like this so it has access to

394
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,360
the

395
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:58,160
those types so the varliptive log rotate

396
00:14:55,360 --> 00:15:00,800
and reserve ports

397
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,360
tcp connects and then all those file

398
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,399
actions

399
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:06,320
uh so it needs access to uh port the

400
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:08,240
admin port for proxy sql

401
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,600
in order to flush the logs because

402
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,480
otherwise process code will just keep

403
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:14,560
writing to the old log file

404
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,480
and it needs all those privileges on the

405
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:19,839
var lip proxy sql directory to make sure

406
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,839
that it can rotate the file

407
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:25,599
in the end it was a great success we

408
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,760
have no more errors our lock rotates

409
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:29,600
incron was running fine we started

410
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,279
rotating and everything started working

411
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,680
thank you dave

412
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:34,320
um is this the best solution probably

413
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,880
not

414
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,680
what would be a better solution i think

415
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:40,160
would

416
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:41,519
start to define proxy sql's own sale

417
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:44,079
linux policy so

418
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:45,120
the var lib proxy sql directory gets its

419
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:48,479
own policy

420
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:50,639
gets the right privileges for log rotate

421
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,519
but as i said i'm not the big as a linux

422
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:54,639
expert

423
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:56,320
so i didn't get that far yet my

424
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:58,800
maybe in some next project i will have

425
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:02,480
to and and maybe next year i can

426
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:05,839
come demonstrate how you generate the

427
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:09,360
s linux uh policy for proxy sql but

428
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:09,920
in this in this case this was enough for

429
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:13,920
us

430
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:15,920
so we got log rotate to

431
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:17,759
to rotate and in this case now it has

432
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,479
permissions to do so on all the files in

433
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:20,639
var lip

434
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:24,079
which is probably not what you want but

435
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:27,360
for this project it was okay

436
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:28,479
alternatives for sl linux most well

437
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:31,279
known is probably

438
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:32,320
armor which is the default in in ubuntu

439
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:37,839
based systems

440
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:41,519
i think and as a and uh and susan linux

441
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:44,240
um and then key differences is um

442
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:45,680
yeah you can see here uh sonic supports

443
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:48,639
a remote policy server

444
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:50,079
if you define it centrally then all your

445
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:53,120
servers get it

446
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:54,079
which sl app armor doesn't and then

447
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:58,160
there's some other

448
00:16:54,079 --> 00:17:00,239
tools which are less known um but

449
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:02,839
when looking up alternatives i found

450
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:06,799
them so i put them here

451
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:09,919
so any questions

452
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:13,359
happy you said that

453
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:16,839
has some good defaults for mysql

454
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:19,839
does it include a port for mysql x

455
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:22,399
and not yet i think

456
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:23,039
not yet i think so the does does uh the

457
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:26,240
default

458
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:28,559
uh policy include um

459
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:30,080
a port for mysql x i don't think it does

460
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:32,480
yet

461
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:34,080
it might and there might be a feature

462
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,240
request for that but i don't know

463
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:38,879
and i think the policy has been is not

464
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:41,919
managed by oracle itself or by mariadb

465
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,919
but i think it's managed by the

466
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:52,080
because kernel is

467
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:55,840
enabled yeah sure

468
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:56,559
show me when enabling tcp i wonder if

469
00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:00,240
there's also

470
00:17:56,559 --> 00:18:03,520
a way to enforce ssl so the question was

471
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:05,120
when you specified the port uh to access

472
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:07,440
is there an option to include this i

473
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,439
don't know

474
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:13,280
and the database once you have set uh ac

475
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:17,679
linux

476
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:20,320
may after export it to a non-sli

477
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:20,720
you must unlock all features first and

478
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,639
then

479
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:25,360
migrate so the question was can you

480
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:28,880
export a database after you status linux

481
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:31,760
i think you can just export it and

482
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:35,120
to to anywhere you want i think as root

483
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:35,120
you will be able to write anywhere

484
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:43,840
okay thank you
