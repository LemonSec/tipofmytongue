00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:08,480
hello hi

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:11,599
i work with jetbrains developer advocate

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:15,040
on quality multi-platform and mobile

4
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:19,439
um this is not my full story i'll

5
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:23,198
say more when i get there but um this is

6
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:24,800
many things in a short time i guess

7
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:26,960
first of all let's have a little

8
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:29,679
disclaimer uh this is not

9
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,000
first of all a getting started or you

10
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:33,120
know

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,280
examples of multi-platform technologies

12
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,879
and it is not me trying to sell you

13
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:40,960
anything so

14
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:43,200
just a little background um i have been

15
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,120
thinking about multi-platform and

16
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:48,399
chasing it advocating for it

17
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:49,599
for many years now and coddling fit into

18
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:52,320
this puzzle

19
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,199
which is why last year i actually joined

20
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,840
job brains

21
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:58,480
not the other way around so i'm here not

22
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:00,480
as a representative but as a

23
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,680
you know believer let's say multiple

24
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,319
offer

25
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,600
so let's start from the basics all

26
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:08,798
software

27
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:12,240
runs on a platform it's obvious

28
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:12,960
but then what is a platform um the way i

29
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,240
see it

30
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:19,280
it's mostly split into some

31
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:22,240
essential components it has a language

32
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:24,240
and it has apis or a framework let's

33
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:27,360
take the the best example like the

34
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:30,000
the lowest let's say the machine

35
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,680
where your code runs has a language

36
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,840
which is a language of the cpu

37
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,280
right the cpu instructions are the

38
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,960
language and the

39
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,320
framework i guess in that in this case

40
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,679
would be

41
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:42,398
whatever you read in the instruction

42
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,920
manual for the cpu uh how to

43
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:47,040
you know shift all the registers and

44
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:49,920
stuff like that um

45
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,680
but on top of this you start building

46
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,439
and you build and build and build

47
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,040
and those platforms inside platforms

48
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:58,240
inside platforms

49
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:59,840
um for example the jvm is its own

50
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:02,798
platform right the language is

51
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:05,280
bytecode and the framework in that case

52
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:07,200
would be the jdk

53
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,800
a browser is a platform like there's

54
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,599
many kinds

55
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:13,200
um and in particular i like to

56
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:16,160
differentiate between

57
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:18,560
soft and hard platforms in a sense that

58
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:21,440
like a soft platform is something that

59
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,000
either gets inlined and like flattened

60
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:25,599
to a single

61
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,319
platform when it runs uh for example c

62
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:29,440
c plus plus right they get compiled

63
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:32,560
directly to

64
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:34,000
cpu instructions and it's as if they

65
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:37,360
disappeared

66
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:41,360
there are other platforms like jvm which

67
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:44,239
are definitely heavier than that and um

68
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,040
you can even think about what is the

69
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:48,239
cost

70
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:50,079
of bridging between the inside and the

71
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:51,840
outside of the platform

72
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,319
yes it is true that technically all the

73
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:58,080
code in the end runs on the cpu

74
00:02:54,319 --> 00:03:01,280
sure but there's different levels of

75
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,400
easiness from going in and out and this

76
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,640
is the trick

77
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,840
there's a third component which is

78
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,518
conventions

79
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,239
uh whenever you have something complex

80
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:13,120
like user interfaces

81
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:14,159
it's almost as if you had you like a

82
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:18,800
separate

83
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:20,720
meta platform on top of everything else

84
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,319
if you take for example mobile android

85
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,000
and ios

86
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:25,839
if you compare them it doesn't even

87
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,159
matter

88
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,000
how they are technically implemented

89
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:33,040
right the only thing that matters

90
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,519
is what does the user expect

91
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,720
what is the behavior that one wants to

92
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:38,319
encode et cetera

93
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:41,040
like for all it's worth they could be

94
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:44,720
simulations running on the same hardware

95
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:47,760
doesn't matter um and this is the trick

96
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:49,440
conventions is one of the reasons why we

97
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:53,200
have not been very

98
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:54,630
effective in doing multi-platform

99
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,480
another thing that i wanted to

100
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:58,959
[Music]

101
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,480
to clear up let's say is the definition

102
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,239
of native because we often

103
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,599
you know hear about oh native

104
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:05,680
development

105
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:07,518
but what is native because there's only

106
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:10,400
two kinds of native

107
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:12,640
associated with this one kind is the

108
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:16,720
machine native like

109
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:20,238
code running very low level c ish

110
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:21,359
the other native is native for the

111
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:24,400
platform

112
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:27,039
so in the case of the jvm for example

113
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,479
it would be like native means something

114
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:32,000
that runs on the jdk

115
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:33,440
right and so like it's often very

116
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,400
important to distinguish between these

117
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,960
two because

118
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:39,520
it's easy to you know start running in

119
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:42,080
one direction or the other and then

120
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,280
but then why why should we do

121
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,440
multi-platform

122
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,039
because like we have not really been

123
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:50,240
doing it so far then

124
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:52,800
what is the big deal so

125
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,840
first of all is there any water here

126
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:59,520
anywhere

127
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:59,520
or yes thanks

128
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:06,240
let's put it this way um unless you know

129
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:08,880
specific cases etc today

130
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,639
all products services apps they don't

131
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:13,520
run on one platform

132
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:15,199
they are an ecosystem and they run on

133
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:17,359
multiple platforms so

134
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:18,479
this is the reality today and it's not

135
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,520
slowing down

136
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:25,120
it's only going faster right um

137
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:27,919
some platforms look very similar mobile

138
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,280
some platforms look kind of similar like

139
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:32,400
mobile versus

140
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:36,638
desktop some platforms don't

141
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:36,638
look at all like servers for example

142
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:41,199
but despite all this it's still your

143
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,160
thing your product

144
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:45,759
running in all of this somehow and many

145
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,639
of the rules

146
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:50,960
um that make up your product are gonna

147
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:52,960
be duplicated right

148
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,320
and the point is you're not duplicating

149
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,239
like

150
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:58,159
it's not the act of writing code that's

151
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,120
a problem and it's not even creating

152
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,400
something

153
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:04,240
the first time the problem is

154
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,799
other people in general in the sense

155
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:10,720
that the moment where you join a team

156
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:11,759
you can't scale if you don't have a way

157
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,240
to enforce

158
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:15,600
these rules to stay together otherwise

159
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,840
they will just

160
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:20,960
you know diverge and they do all the

161
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:22,239
time so you're duplicating

162
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,318
specifications

163
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,520
because those happen very often during

164
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:28,720
implementation

165
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,758
you're duplicating architecture naming

166
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,800
conventions

167
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:35,280
solving problems bugs

168
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,639
assets ui and all sorts of things and

169
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,960
while doing so

170
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:39,680
you are creating silos you are making it

171
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,000
so that you

172
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,280
become sort of an enemy with the other

173
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,120
team instead of

174
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:48,080
working together so and then why aren't

175
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,800
we doing it

176
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,120
what's the big deal so it's complicated

177
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,800
as

178
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:58,560
usual um so even when the platforms are

179
00:06:54,800 --> 00:07:00,840
very similar like uh mobile hey oh thank

180
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:03,840
you very much

181
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,840
sorry

182
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:10,400
even when the platforms are very similar

183
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:13,440
um they're still very different

184
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:15,120
in a sense that the conventions are so

185
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,000
different and it's not just about

186
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,919
running the same

187
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,319
code you really have to think about the

188
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:22,479
big picture you have to think about how

189
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:23,599
architecturally structurally how your

190
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:25,919
app behaves

191
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:28,159
and what is expected of it in all the

192
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:30,159
different platforms

193
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,680
also technically we are doing it like if

194
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,840
you look at c c plus plus

195
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,680
those are technically cross-platform in

196
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,719
a sense that they run on different cpus

197
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,520
etc

198
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,880
the difference is the conventions they

199
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:43,919
target

200
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,879
are all very very similar like file

201
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:48,159
systems

202
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:49,599
or you know io in general that's more or

203
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,919
less standardized so it's

204
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:53,759
a lot simpler to do that effectively

205
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:55,599
across platform but when you start

206
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:58,080
you start talking about ui you start

207
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:59,759
talking about sensors user behavior

208
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,520
and other things then it's a whole

209
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:04,160
different mess

210
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:05,919
and again like cc plus helps with like

211
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,960
soft platforms in the sense that it's

212
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:10,479
easy to

213
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:12,479
port that over otherwise other attempts

214
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:14,080
of doing something more haven't really

215
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:16,878
been spectacular

216
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:17,599
if you recall well java first of all it

217
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:19,280
works

218
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:20,639
you can create you know cross-platform

219
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:23,119
uis etc but

220
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:24,479
it doesn't feel native it's heavy don't

221
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,879
even get me started on all the

222
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:29,758
javascript based attempts which

223
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,560
i won't even talk about um so we all

224
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,680
know and

225
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:36,958
and multi-platform got this bad

226
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:39,439
you know fame of just being bad

227
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:40,640
not working not native in that sense

228
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,080
because it's trying to hide the

229
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:45,279
conventions

230
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:48,640
in fact if you recall write once

231
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:49,360
run everywhere java's motto i think this

232
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,560
is the flaw

233
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,560
because you're not trying to write

234
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,199
something once and then just forget

235
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,518
about it

236
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,120
you're not trying to make all the

237
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:59,680
platforms one thing

238
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,959
and then you know just not have to think

239
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,959
about stuff

240
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:04,640
to me it's the other way around you need

241
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:07,920
to engineer once

242
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:08,800
and by engineer i mean design uh

243
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:11,599
understand

244
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:13,760
think plan uh you know solve problems

245
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:16,480
write interfaces and common code

246
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:17,279
once and then you don't just run it

247
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,360
everywhere you

248
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:20,640
specialize it everywhere this is how it

249
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,560
should be this is the key

250
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:24,959
to doing multi-platform the right way

251
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:29,439
the way that works

252
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:30,959
and essentially

253
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,480
this is the whole okay we have five

254
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:34,839
minutes perfect okay so

255
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,480
because this is the core of it

256
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:37,839
multi-platform

257
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,640
first of all what you need to understand

258
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:39,600
is that you're already doing

259
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,000
multi-platform

260
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,640
because you are shipping on different

261
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,080
platforms

262
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:46,399
you're just doing it wrong because

263
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:50,320
you're not sharing anything right

264
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:52,880
um all you know edge cases

265
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,640
or it's on my problem because it's on

266
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:58,240
the other platform etc

267
00:09:54,640 --> 00:10:00,720
those don't help um we really need

268
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,920
to to come together to make this work

269
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,360
because in the end

270
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:05,360
again it's not just creating something

271
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,399
the first time that something is going

272
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:10,000
to change

273
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:12,160
requirements are going to swift you know

274
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,160
under your feet very very fast and when

275
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:16,800
you don't have time to handle them

276
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:18,319
and so you don't want to be spending

277
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,599
time solving problems twice

278
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,680
you don't want to be spending time

279
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:25,360
fixing bugs that should have not

280
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:26,640
even existed plus in my experience

281
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,640
the specifications the real

282
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:31,600
specifications of

283
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:32,000
a real product they come eighty percent

284
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,160
of them

285
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,760
while you're actually making a product

286
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,600
and so if you make it as

287
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,760
two separate entities you're gonna have

288
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:42,240
two separate sets of specifications

289
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:44,240
with all sorts of bugs related to they

290
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:48,720
should be the same etc

291
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:52,640
so plus we have this tendency of

292
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:55,519
glorifying shipping fast versus

293
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:56,560
shipping value fast which doesn't mean

294
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:59,760
just put something out

295
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:00,000
it means sure we don't want to you know

296
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,880
take

297
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,519
forever but let's think about the long

298
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,000
term

299
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:07,440
let's think about how can we get value

300
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
to users

301
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,360
in the fastest cycle which is not just

302
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,560
getting something to them

303
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,320
because you know something buggy that

304
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,680
doesn't work it's not value in my

305
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:18,480
opinion

306
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:20,239
and also i think the biggest fallacy of

307
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:23,440
all of this is that people believe

308
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:26,240
that multi-platform whenever it

309
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:27,760
comes up um it should be a silver bullet

310
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,560
it should fix all problems

311
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:32,079
make everything easier faster etc that's

312
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:35,040
never going to be the case

313
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:36,560
because you're not going to be faster in

314
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:39,199
the short term

315
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:40,079
you might be same speed maybe even

316
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,920
slower

317
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:43,199
but then the return of investment is

318
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,959
going to be huge

319
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,040
um it's not going to be easier you still

320
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:49,760
need to know all the platforms

321
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,480
not you you but your team needs to

322
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:53,600
design

323
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:56,240
and and think comprehensively right

324
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,519
and so that that's what needs to happen

325
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,680
um

326
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:01,360
and we need to stop thinking about ui

327
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:04,560
first as we often do as

328
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:09,360
mobile developers because

329
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:11,040
ui is just one side of all of this

330
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:15,360
there's much more than that it's

331
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:15,360
actually most of it is not ui

332
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:21,040
imagine if tomorrow they came to you

333
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:24,320
with an sdk

334
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:27,199
an oracle oops you shouldn't say that

335
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,320
that just tells you exactly what you

336
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,680
need to display

337
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,440
you don't need to care about state

338
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,920
management at all you don't need to care

339
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,399
about

340
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:35,760
what happens now edge cases you just

341
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:38,800
draw to the screen

342
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:42,639
i will make development for

343
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:44,719
mobile so much easier it's crazy

344
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:45,760
and and this is how you can do that

345
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,880
today

346
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:49,519
kotlin is a great example of this and

347
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:52,880
here we

348
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:54,000
cycle back because

349
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,439
i don't want to say for the first time

350
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,320
but for the first time in a way that's

351
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,560
easy

352
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:00,800
tooling friendly and other things you

353
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:04,160
have the opportunity to create

354
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:07,279
specialized code that doesn't run

355
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:09,600
on a hard platform like embedded in some

356
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:12,320
scripting runtime or something

357
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,040
it gets flattened down to whatever is

358
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:16,639
native

359
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:20,079
for each platform which to me is the key

360
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:22,079
to doing this there's still a big

361
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:23,519
issue with ui which is a completely

362
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:24,880
different topic altogether

363
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:26,639
but again you don't need ui to do

364
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:29,920
multi-platform like you can still

365
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:31,360
share 80 or more of your actual use

366
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:34,399
cases and code

367
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:37,360
um without even touching ui right

368
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:39,279
and even in the ui you can still get

369
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,839
really close in the presentation logic

370
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:43,040
logic

371
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:45,199
um sharing that etc otherwise on some

372
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:48,160
platforms like android you might

373
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:49,920
never have the control you need to to

374
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,040
have true parity depending on your use

375
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:54,079
cases etc

376
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:56,480
and in that case the only solution is to

377
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:58,239
go one level deeper

378
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,680
but then when you do that it means you

379
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,600
also need to recreate

380
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,959
all the infrastructure that that level

381
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,560
gives you

382
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:07,199
which is something a flutter does for

383
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:09,119
example but it's one case

384
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:10,880
and it won't work for everyone and it

385
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,320
really depends on your use case but the

386
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:14,720
point is

387
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:16,959
it's complicated and you need to think

388
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:20,240
about it because right now

389
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:21,760
you often believe you're doing less work

390
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:24,000
and perhaps that's true in the very

391
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:26,399
short term but

392
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,680
it's not true at all in the long term

393
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:29,920
and um

394
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:31,519
things are not slowing down so you know

395
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:33,120
they're gonna come for you

396
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:35,040
and time is up so if you have any

397
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:38,079
questions i'll be glad to answer

398
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:41,439
offline and you can find the slides

399
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:43,680
in five minutes at this address

400
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:45,020
uh yeah follow me on twitter and thank

401
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:52,209
you

402
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:52,210
[Applause]

403
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:59,839
yeah we're a bit short on times of this

404
00:14:56,839 --> 00:14:59,839
uh

405
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:13,839
sorry

406
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,320
you
