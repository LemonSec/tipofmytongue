1
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,880
my name is dalai

2
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,559
i've been working nowadays i work as a

3
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:15,599
development coordinator

4
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:17,520
for blender at planner in amsterdam i

5
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:20,240
started coding for blender

6
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,759
10 years 11 years ago my first patch

7
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:23,759
into blender

8
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:26,880
and although it's fascinating to talk

9
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,960
about the blender projects for 20 20.

10
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,560
i think you can all find these in our

11
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,800
official communication channels which a

12
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:35,519
lot of you don't follow

13
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,480
so i recommend going to code.blender.org

14
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,640
this is our

15
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,760
main communication page from developers

16
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,160
to developers

17
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:46,239
we just recently posted uh something

18
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:49,360
about the main 10 projects for this year

19
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:52,000
but for this moment here

20
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,559
things more interesting i think it's

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,480
more

22
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:56,640
interesting to take from all these

23
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,640
projects which can

24
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,000
see how it's going to be affecting for

25
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,320
the end users

26
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,440
what it's going to bring to blender

27
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,360
leave them aside

28
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,720
for a little bit and talk about a

29
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,880
particular project

30
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,640
which for me is a particular pet project

31
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,240
it's a area of

32
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,880
technology and blender which i'm quite

33
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:17,600
passionate about virtual reality

34
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,720
virtual reality or augmented reality or

35
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,960
xr which is

36
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,000
an umbrella for all of those and from

37
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,679
this project

38
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,680
try to illustrate a little bit how do we

39
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,840
get new developers in blender

40
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,880
how to get new features into blender how

41
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,439
is our communication

42
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,240
where does that happen how it is to be

43
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:36,720
transparent

44
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:40,798
and open and big at the same time so

45
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:42,798
let's start our journey here in 2014

46
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,000
we're starting to play with vr in

47
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:47,920
blender

48
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,240
so this is the gooseberry project

49
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:52,560
was there was at the same time the one

50
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,079
of the open movies we had in blender

51
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,159
was starting who here knows about the

52
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:58,880
open movies

53
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:00,079
okay good after open projects made by

54
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,240
the blender institute

55
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:03,600
language animation studio and i was

56
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,320
playing with one of their files and

57
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,520
starting to

58
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:09,758
to render with stereoscopic vr basically

59
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:11,359
creates two panoramas you put an oculus

60
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:14,079
and you can look around

61
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,440
2014 like six years ago it was actually

62
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,440
really well received

63
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,560
at the time the mother of the director

64
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,079
of gooseberry

65
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,800
or the cosmic laundromatos they actually

66
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:25,520
were like fascinated oh my god

67
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,480
and for me was this is because that was

68
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:30,959
something that did not

69
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,959
start as a feature for vr

70
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,200
it started as something for full domes

71
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:36,720
is a different kind of technology

72
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,399
and i started working on this as a

73
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:41,040
contributor as a volunteer

74
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,840
and at some point made it to blender on

75
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,000
mainstream

76
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,519
start on 16 we're saying okay we can

77
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,720
render in vr

78
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:48,720
but what if you can

79
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:54,480
sorry what if you could

80
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:56,720
give one to tom as well to be very

81
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:59,040
thankful

82
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,000
what if you could also alter nvr if you

83
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,720
could experience

84
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,840
and see how the project is going before

85
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,879
you go all the way to the final

86
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,480
rendering

87
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:09,599
so this is we're starting to experiment

88
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,599
with the storyboard

89
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:15,599
experimentally storyboarding into

90
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,319
blender but then putting

91
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:18,959
one of those headsets and looking around

92
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:23,119
at that time

93
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:25,360
whatever plug-in using the oculus sdk

94
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,159
totally known gpl compatible totally

95
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,519
experimental

96
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:30,399
non-official but it got things going

97
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:31,920
like it actually

98
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,760
the technology is very interesting

99
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:37,839
instead we're starting to

100
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:40,000
get some traction 2016

101
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:42,159
the brand animation studio they had the

102
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,840
caminandis one of their

103
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:45,599
open productions over there and they

104
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,480
said what if you could partner up with

105
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:48,238
google

106
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,000
google at the time was promoting a lot

107
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:53,360
of the cardboard their

108
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,760
cardboard headsets and they wanted

109
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:58,080
content and they wanted authoring tools

110
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:00,079
this is c they called digital content

111
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,799
creation tools

112
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,840
and blender as a big umbrella was never

113
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:06,080
afraid of

114
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:08,879
partnering up with someone as big as

115
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:10,720
google if it was of common interest

116
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:12,640
there was nothing that was violating the

117
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,280
openness the freedom is the other way

118
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,119
around

119
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,600
they allowed us allowed blender to

120
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:20,320
actually move forward a little bit of

121
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,519
its vr agenda and produce a very

122
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,800
interesting content

123
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:27,919
at the time they're using open hmd is a

124
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,639
was a linux based reverse engineering

125
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:33,120
based

126
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:36,320
uh html vr support

127
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,320
for blender and linux

128
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,840
what i'm saying that because at that

129
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,479
time i say i one of the experiments i

130
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,479
was showing was

131
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:43,680
using the official oculus sdk the other

132
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:45,840
one was using

133
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,520
some reverse engineering linux but how

134
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,359
does it become mainstream

135
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,960
how do we how can we take something like

136
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,520
this and make into blender

137
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:56,159
the interesting thing is there are a lot

138
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:58,400
of people interest on that

139
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,600
project i was showing here something i

140
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,520
was actually developing

141
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,960
personally myself like in a research

142
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,880
facility in brazil

143
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,320
because people from the oculus

144
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:09,280
animations oculus

145
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:10,240
story which was a mini group inside

146
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,239
oculus

147
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,440
the company was bought by facebook they

148
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,080
wanted to experiment

149
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:17,919
storyboarding for our vr experiences and

150
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:20,719
the alternative was to

151
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:22,240
draw something animate compile the game

152
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,720
and then see how it looks like

153
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,240
and then do it over and over again and

154
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,479
if you could have something that

155
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,320
the same offering that authoring tool

156
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:31,199
for the game can also be used to preview

157
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:34,479
the game

158
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:36,240
exactly uh very impressive but you have

159
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:37,599
people like the mpx project which are

160
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,440
people that were already involved in

161
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,680
blender

162
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:44,560
i have guys who here knows what is the

163
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:46,880
grease pencil in blender

164
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,960
some grease pencil is what allows people

165
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:52,240
to do those kind of 2d drawings

166
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:55,280
in a 3d environment and the whole

167
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,240
greece peso team is actually composed by

168
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,440
people that are not

169
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,440
in the payroll of the blender

170
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:02,400
foundations like confirmers and they're

171
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:04,800
being voted for a few years already

172
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,799
and they

173
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,520
went to the next well went to the next

174
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,520
level sorry

175
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:13,198
and decided to think how what if he

176
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,198
could also draw in vr

177
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:16,800
it could be working with blender put an

178
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:18,560
oculus and work a little bit

179
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,319
and take it out so that was the whole

180
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:23,360
idea and what they wanted is

181
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:24,479
as seamless integration they wanted to

182
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,800
be able to

183
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:28,400
not have to learn a new ui not have to

184
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,080
learn any way to interact

185
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,440
so then for example they wanted the

186
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,840
whole blender interface

187
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,479
inside the vr space and they made it

188
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,638
they had

189
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:38,318
someone hacking their way around blender

190
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:41,520
it was a really nice prototype

191
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:42,880
had people like blender xr which is a

192
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:46,560
company called marui

193
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:48,719
they developed a plugin for maya for vr

194
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,160
basically a plugin where you could do

195
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,720
all sort of operations

196
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,759
immersed in vr so there it's only ui

197
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,960
it's on ux

198
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:57,120
and they wanted to start supporting

199
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,479
blender but they had the same problem we

200
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,759
had in the other projects

201
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:01,520
how can we do something that's

202
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:02,080
compatible with gpl with the blender

203
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,198
license

204
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:07,039
and at the same time compatible with the

205
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:09,039
industry standards for you know the

206
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:13,759
oculus or the vive or the

207
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:16,159
microsoft lands interesting problem

208
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:17,199
benfx is a group in germany it's also

209
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,000
been involved with the blended

210
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:20,560
development

211
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,599
of the contributors so users artists

212
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,680
that use blender

213
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:25,919
giving us feedback sitting together with

214
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,680
developers to think about the features

215
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:29,758
and we're taking some of the open movies

216
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,039
and re-render them as a panorama and

217
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:32,880
have a small tv

218
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:34,639
that you see immersed in the city video

219
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,240
playing there

220
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:37,440
and they are also interested on using

221
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,400
blender and if you are for scene

222
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,440
inspection

223
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,280
they are doing architecture

224
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,719
reconstruction you want to be able to

225
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:45,039
look around and then

226
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,400
look around and before rendering the

227
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:47,280
final thing they wanted to use blender

228
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:50,878
they're using blender

229
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:53,198
and surprising ubisoft more recently

230
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:55,039
they joined the blender development fund

231
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:58,240
it's a way that

232
00:07:55,039 --> 00:08:00,159
if watch a tone stock probably

233
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,080
he covered most of the history of how

234
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:05,840
the funding happened to blender

235
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:07,840
where we are today but basically ubisoft

236
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:09,440
not only joined the blender funding

237
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:12,080
giving a blender money

238
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:13,280
but also promising to allocate some

239
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:15,840
development time

240
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:17,440
on their own team ubisoft france to

241
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,960
actually implement features into blender

242
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,039
and they're particularly interested in

243
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,719
vr because they want tools for set

244
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:23,280
dressing so you have your set you want

245
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,879
to put

246
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:30,559
different furniture or peebles or stones

247
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:32,159
or if you're a director and you want to

248
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,679
see how a shot is going to look like

249
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:35,439
before you render out

250
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:37,679
since everything nowadays goes through

251
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,519
computer also 3d

252
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:41,279
maestro also have authoring tools for

253
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:43,360
the director to be immersed

254
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:44,800
so how do we consolidate all those

255
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,480
different tools and what's the role of

256
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:48,800
the foundation in all of that

257
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,920
because you think about it there's the

258
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,680
foundation can grow

259
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,959
until a certain point but the

260
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,680
fundamental role of the blended

261
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:55,199
foundation

262
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:57,279
i would say is to make sure the

263
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,240
collaboration can happen to provide the

264
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:00,080
infrastructure

265
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,839
to provide the onboarding and to make

266
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:04,640
sure

267
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:06,240
it cannot work together luckily for

268
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:08,959
everyone involved in that

269
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:11,120
last year in june was the first release

270
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:14,640
of open xr 1.0

271
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:17,519
opex open xr is a standard by chronos

272
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,640
chrome's the same group behind www uh

273
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:22,000
html

274
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:25,120
behind opengl so all those acronyms

275
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,240
we got used to and it started they tried

276
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:29,519
to unify

277
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:32,160
this whole ecosystem for vr while before

278
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:33,839
every time a software wanted support

279
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:37,040
either oculus or

280
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:39,120
5 or microsoft hololens you need to

281
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,079
support their sdk you need to be

282
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:43,200
compatible with their

283
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:45,360
cdk yada yada they created a whole

284
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:47,360
abstraction layer where

285
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,640
blender does only needs to worry about

286
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,760
openxr

287
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:54,160
and the same way opengl is integrated in

288
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:56,480
a low level in the operating system

289
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,439
it just com lice is compatible i don't

290
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,920
know the details

291
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:01,440
it shouldn't matter but it allowed

292
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:03,199
blender foundation to say you know what

293
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:06,640
we officially can actually

294
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:10,160
help bring vr into reality so last year

295
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:11,600
we had julian eisel to participate in

296
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:14,079
the google summer of code

297
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:17,440
we still use the google summer of code

298
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:20,239
to bring new developers on board

299
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,959
and he basically got as far as i'll see

300
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,320
quite far

301
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:23,839
the whole scene inspection this is again

302
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,839
one of the open movies we had at the

303
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:27,760
blender animation studio

304
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:30,480
and he was using open structure the

305
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:32,000
whole thing only on windows i believe

306
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,760
because on linux they still don't have a

307
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,120
head tracking

308
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:37,120
but we say you know what we can

309
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:42,560
as a blender project can support the

310
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:44,839
basics of vr vr is a very niche project

311
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:46,000
that is a bit overkill to the to

312
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:47,920
dedicate

313
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,040
con we have to hold that fund right to

314
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,680
dedicate like car

315
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:53,519
money to future creep and try to get a

316
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:58,079
really smooth vr experience which

317
00:10:53,519 --> 00:11:01,360
who here has um a vr headset

318
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:01,839
oh my god there's actually a ginger

319
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,050
glass

320
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:05,279
oh

321
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:07,279
[Laughter]

322
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:10,160
i've seen a lot of people we are like a

323
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:12,000
very biased sub-sample

324
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:14,240
but it's a very interesting topic and we

325
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,120
developers geekers thinkers we like to

326
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,399
think about that so we the idea was to

327
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,640
at least

328
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:22,480
get the basics running the fundamentals

329
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,920
you know julian actually been

330
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,800
a contributor to blender for years

331
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:28,240
already so six years

332
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:30,640
he'd been on and off in a blender

333
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,040
contract he participated in two google

334
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:34,959
summer

335
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:35,839
codes first commit was in 2014 and

336
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:37,680
nowadays

337
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:39,040
after the google summer of course was a

338
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,800
nice project

339
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,880
uh julian also was available so you know

340
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,640
what come on board

341
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:46,320
we we had enough funding at the time to

342
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:48,560
have him like working for time

343
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:50,480
and that's not he's not there only to do

344
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:53,359
vr once working user interface

345
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,839
and basic but fixing strategy and

346
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,760
everything else

347
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:59,600
but it's also part of the process here

348
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:03,040
okay this is working well let's get him

349
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:06,399
involved in let's commit both parts to

350
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,399
continue this relationship

351
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:10,959
of course the we do again we don't do

352
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,839
anything

353
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:15,279
only by ourselves and for ourselves so

354
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:15,760
for instance the blender conference is

355
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:18,560
here

356
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:20,480
actually got one of those like a small

357
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,199
representative representation of those

358
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,200
groups

359
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,320
i was talking about people from blender

360
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:28,639
effects

361
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:30,880
danielle from mpx people from ubisoft

362
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:32,639
where they could sit together it's okay

363
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,399
what can the foundation do

364
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:36,160
and what can everyone else do so i agree

365
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:37,440
that the first two milestones is by the

366
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,839
foundation which is basically all the

367
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,320
things

368
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:41,600
open excel support it is the basics

369
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:44,959
inspection

370
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:46,720
and api for drawing in vr but

371
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:48,239
what's going to be the experience the

372
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,560
usability into vr

373
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,880
no one knows still it's going to be a

374
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:55,920
few years until that's consolidated

375
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,639
so then i was going to lead a third

376
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:59,279
milestone

377
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:00,320
toward basically drawing and sculpting

378
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,920
interaction

379
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:05,680
the mottoey which is not represented

380
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:08,560
here will make sure their plug-in can be

381
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:09,920
run into whatever api we come up with

382
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,279
they're going to have like ubisoft

383
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,319
keeping us in check because at some

384
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:14,720
point you're going to say hey

385
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:17,760
they basically is there go have fun and

386
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:19,680
give call back give call back

387
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:21,200
well we cannot have people gathering

388
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:25,120
physically at all times it's

389
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:28,800
not practical and at the same time

390
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:30,240
we later as a project has years 20 25

391
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:34,800
years

392
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:37,120
way too many years 18 years

393
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:40,079
since it's open source but it's since

394
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:44,079
1998 is when uh

395
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:44,079
when it was online and

396
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:48,000
the whole infrastructure blender of the

397
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:51,199
communication was built on top of

398
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:54,560
you know mainly at least 2002 here

399
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:55,599
i see which in a way didn't aid it so

400
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:59,680
well

401
00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:02,240
when it comes to competitive twitter to

402
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:03,199
facebook people are going to use the

403
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,760
chain of their

404
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:07,040
their use to use so so we're trying to

405
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:11,279
modernize a little bit

406
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:14,959
so this is a rocket based online rc

407
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:17,360
it's like so we have a generic

408
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:18,719
we call blender.chat is the website

409
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,639
anyone can go there it's where the

410
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,839
developers now talk among themselves is

411
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:23,440
where we work

412
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:25,920
we even as an example we have like a

413
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:28,000
whole vr room channel only dedicated for

414
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:29,279
that topic

415
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,199
and it's really the place where people

416
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:32,480
are supposed to work we have a dev talk

417
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:35,519
which is a discourse

418
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:38,079
based website where again

419
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:39,920
we try to separate user feedback and

420
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:42,319
usability from general development

421
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:44,479
but the idea is that the user the cycles

422
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,880
module the grease massive module the vr

423
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,160
group

424
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:48,079
should be able to use that among

425
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,880
themselves and everyone can read and can

426
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:51,279
follow

427
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:53,600
they can in a way interact we keep

428
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:57,760
everything open and transparent

429
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:58,480
we have the every monday every monday we

430
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,319
have like

431
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,760
uh development meeting and keep

432
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:04,880
everything there posted

433
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:06,560
what happened what didn't happen the

434
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:08,160
progress reports of every single

435
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:11,359
developer

436
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:13,439
jesus christ shame on me

437
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,560
it's only one more slide and we as

438
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,959
mentioned before

439
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,839
we have a nice blog po blog where we

440
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:21,680
encourage

441
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:23,920
not only our own it's not a place for pr

442
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:25,439
we're not here about pr not here to talk

443
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,639
about marketing but a place where people

444
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,160
can share development

445
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:30,000
we are the grease expensive team which

446
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:33,519
is working you know

447
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,279
in spain in argentina and we kind of

448
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:36,959
creep taps on their work and and have

449
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:40,079
some collaboration they can go there

450
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:42,560
on that space the blender infrastructure

451
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:45,040
is placed for everyone that contributes

452
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:47,680
to the blended project to really

453
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,560
take ownership from and of course use

454
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,319
this for also

455
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:52,399
outreach for the community where using

456
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:54,720
youtube using twitter

457
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:55,680
so overall we are in a bit of a

458
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,720
transition

459
00:15:55,680 --> 00:16:01,519
from going over traditional irc

460
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,000
and mainly and lonely developers working

461
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:04,240
their own

462
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,519
little projects to try to be a bigger

463
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:08,720
and try to

464
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:11,839
get more people to collaborate so

465
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:13,279
basically you hope we yeah we hope that

466
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:14,880
that given insight in the project and

467
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:22,399
more people can join us

468
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:23,759
thank you

469
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:26,240
i also believe you might have five

470
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:29,920
minutes for questions

471
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,920
so if anyone has any question or

472
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:37,839
comments

473
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:52,959
more or less

474
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:55,199
if you go to the code.blender.org we

475
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:57,279
posted this last monday

476
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:58,399
uh there's an overview of the 10 big

477
00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:00,480
core projects there's

478
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:01,800
even more than that but those are the

479
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,279
projects that's everyone's

480
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:05,599
responsibility

481
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:06,640
every single developer in the core team

482
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:09,599
would be like

483
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:11,039
be responsible for this the criteria we

484
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:12,399
didn't put there but basically if a

485
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:14,319
developer goes away

486
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:16,319
and the one leading a project here

487
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:18,480
someone would kill it in for them

488
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:19,760
if the vr developer goes away maybe we

489
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,400
won't have developer for

490
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:23,919
vr for another three years yeah that's

491
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,360
the reality right

492
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:28,559
those are the core projects we're going

493
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:28,559
to make sure is delivered

494
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:35,840
let's see hand here uh

495
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:36,320
when you actually use vr and you see the

496
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:39,360
same

497
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:41,039
thing in your screen and the mvr it

498
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,639
actually is really different i mean the

499
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:44,000
feeling of seeing the models is really

500
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:47,200
different from

501
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:49,440
so exactly how does uh

502
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,320
how does it help the productivity to

503
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,799
have the vr

504
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:54,720
uh is it just for making vr or just for

505
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:56,639
example you using vr will help you make

506
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,880
like a movie later

507
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:00,480
i'm just curious about how vr helps the

508
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,000
productivity because i will assume

509
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,240
if i get something off the screen we

510
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,960
could people may look it on the editing

511
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,880
screen

512
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,400
but if you make it on vr then in the

513
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:11,440
screen is going to be different

514
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:15,840
so just my question how yeah could

515
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:15,840
anyone hear it

516
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,480
what's the point of vr if you're not

517
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:24,000
only doing vr if you're doing vr it's

518
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:26,160
very obvious of course

519
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,600
but again ubisoft for example they'd

520
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,960
like to

521
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,799
even immerse they can still have a

522
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:33,679
traditional virtual camera there

523
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:34,080
like a preview in the virtual set if

524
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:36,400
we're

525
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,918
doing our character modeling i want at

526
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,440
some point that's more ar

527
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:42,240
you are here in blender and you put your

528
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:43,600
glass and you see for modeling this

529
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,600
you know lecture room you can see the

530
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:47,520
whole lecture on and go back

531
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,879
uh if you're doing character modeling

532
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,400
try you know you probably have seen

533
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,919
those making offs of disney where you

534
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:54,400
have these sculpted

535
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:56,799
characters you can also you know could

536
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:59,919
also use these to inspect them

537
00:18:56,799 --> 00:19:01,840
i'm totally biased but

538
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:03,600
for sculpting can actually sculpt in a

539
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:05,600
more natural medium right

540
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:08,080
you actually see and move around and

541
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:10,799
touch so

542
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:12,159
but the real answer is no one knows but

543
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:13,679
we're

544
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,440
willing to give it a try for a

545
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:17,200
technology as long as

546
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:19,360
there is this other part from the

547
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:22,320
community like embracing that as well

548
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:22,320
it's kind of the process

549
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:26,399
we need to create people to come back to

550
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,120
work

551
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,240
is it good maybe it's a good mid term uh

552
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,919
middle

553
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:40,960
a good compromise between digital and

554
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:40,960
analog do you have a question

555
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:50,240
for today i don't need to use oh to use

556
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:52,720
a blender

557
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:53,919
for 2d people well there's a whole

558
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:57,039
roadmap now

559
00:19:53,919 --> 00:20:00,400
for storyboarding uh with

560
00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:03,120
tools like blender for even like 2d

561
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,840
because even for 2d it's so handy to

562
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:07,120
have a camera where you can actually pan

563
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:09,600
around there you can reuse assets for

564
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:11,600
different shots

565
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:14,799
that's a whole discussion i think you

566
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,799
might have for one last question

567
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:21,840
it's not

568
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,000
we do have a developer rickard antalik

569
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:29,360
who has been

570
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:31,120
hired to work full-time with trying

571
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:33,600
to help the infrastructure as a whole

572
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:35,520
but also to try to tackle the video

573
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:37,280
sequency editor

574
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:39,120
but it's one of those projects that if

575
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:40,639
he had for whatever reason decided to

576
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:43,918
walk away

577
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:45,840
we won't be able to prioritize however

578
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:48,000
is in the agenda this vulcan for

579
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:51,520
instance is in the agenda as well

580
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:53,280
more storyboarding for 2ds in the agenda

581
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:55,600
more sculpting tools texture painting

582
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:57,200
tools there's a lot of work being done

583
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:59,520
just we had to draw the line at some

584
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:02,240
point and these we can promise

585
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,799
everything else is circumstantial and

586
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:05,280
again

587
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:06,000
anyone is welcome to to add to blender

588
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,240
to bring

589
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,360
ideally to see what the roadmap of

590
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:12,240
blender try to help

591
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:13,199
on top of that otherwise might get too

592
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:15,120
complicated

593
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:17,120
but everyone's welcome to where is a bit

594
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:20,080
of an open end what's going to be there

595
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:21,600
we only can only tell once ready oh

596
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:23,039
thanks everyone for the time we have

597
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:30,350
seekers here

598
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:34,650
and that's what time have thank you

599
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:34,649
