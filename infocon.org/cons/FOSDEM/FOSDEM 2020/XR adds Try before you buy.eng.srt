00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,440
responsible for augmented reality

17
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:50,559
on a web i'm working at

18
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:52,959
saint elmo's it is an advertisement

19
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:55,120
agency consisting over 200 of

20
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:58,480
professionals all around

21
00:00:55,120 --> 00:01:01,760
germany and we are good in

22
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:06,240
experimental con content and we

23
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:10,400
bring storytellings and campaigns

24
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,399
different air solutions to our brands

25
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,200
so as i already said we are using

26
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:18,560
multi-realities

27
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,200
to order telling to break up the rules

28
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,400
and

29
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:25,759
brings the new wow effects to to show

30
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:29,200
our clients what is possible

31
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:31,360
and so one day people will

32
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,960
wake up and realize that augmented

33
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:35,520
reality is here

34
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:37,439
and uh it's happens a lot of questions

35
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:40,479
about this sometimes overhyped

36
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:40,880
sector but the biggest question is how

37
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:44,159
it

38
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:46,000
actually make money

39
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,399
how many of you have your phones in your

40
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,280
hands right now

41
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:52,560
yeah as you see it's already 20 20 and

42
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:56,159
people still

43
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:59,280
are keeping phones in their hands and

44
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:04,479
everything that is happening right now

45
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:08,080
in technological sector is going around

46
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:10,318
phones so and

47
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,200
advertisement are really keeping an eye

48
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:14,079
on ar

49
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:15,920
because this is the next step this is a

50
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:19,200
new level of how we can

51
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:21,359
interact with our customers how we can

52
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,760
help them to play around with the

53
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:27,040
product to adapt it to your needs

54
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:29,920
and see what is possible more than

55
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,920
it's only shown

56
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:37,040
and actually xr can help that

57
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:40,640
but what is xr do you know

58
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:43,679
yes x r is for extended realities

59
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:44,160
and actually it contains everything that

60
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,360
you

61
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:49,519
can see here like 360 video

62
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,200
you already know it's just a cardboard

63
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:51,680
and and your phone and you're rolling

64
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,958
around

65
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:58,239
on your chair to see some 360 videos

66
00:02:54,959 --> 00:03:00,159
virtual reality can be delivered with

67
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:04,319
focus or wife

68
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:06,480
so basically it's your reality

69
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:07,599
absolutely replace it with a virtual

70
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,879
ones

71
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:11,839
augmented reality is where the phones

72
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:15,760
come on

73
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:18,239
and this is an experience when you

74
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:21,120
overlay your real world will work with

75
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,120
some type of

76
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:27,599
uh with some type of digital

77
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:28,080
layer on top of it and mixed reality all

78
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,840
of you

79
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,280
i guess have already heard about the

80
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:34,560
hololens

81
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:37,040
it helps to interact with augmented

82
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,760
reality for example with the gestures

83
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:42,079
with the light

84
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:45,760
estimations with object occlusions

85
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:49,519
and so on so all of that together

86
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:52,720
happens to name xr but still

87
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:56,080
the key tech the technology in this

88
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:58,799
sector is augmented reality

89
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,680
and what do we know about that it's that

90
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:02,959
it contains

91
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:04,879
about from native ar applications web

92
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:08,319
air and social media

93
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:10,879
let's get a bit closer uh some of you

94
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:12,079
probably know that you you need to

95
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:14,560
install

96
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,239
an applications to be able to see the

97
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:19,759
augmented reality happening

98
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:22,880
on your phone but we also

99
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:26,160
have a web solutions for that

100
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:29,360
like for example using only html it's

101
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:31,840
and in javascript we can bring the

102
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:34,400
augmented reality experience right on

103
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,400
your table

104
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:43,520
helping people use only their phones and

105
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:46,960
nothing else is needed

106
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:50,159
also for web air experience we can have

107
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:53,680
uh arc quick look with from apple

108
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:56,960
which is using usd set format and

109
00:04:53,680 --> 00:05:00,560
model model viewer for android

110
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:04,320
which is using gltf

111
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:08,080
models the apple is going forward

112
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:10,960
into ar and they already implemented

113
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,599
high def initial 3d models which can be

114
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:15,599
placed

115
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:19,199
where on every surface you can get

116
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:22,960
and the google user ar ads can

117
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:26,720
already help you to visualize an object

118
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:29,440
just right typing in into a search like

119
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:31,280
shark penguins astronaut and you will

120
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:39,600

staying with you in your room

122
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:46,880
yeah so uh

123
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:49,919
going to a social media yeah thanks

124
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:52,240
it's it is about a facebook

125
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:53,120
and instagram i guess all of you already

126
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:57,039
know the

127
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:59,919
spark studio from from a facebook

128
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:00,560
it's actually really good engine who

129
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:03,520
plays a

130
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,639
augmented reality experience for almost

131
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:07,120
of users

132
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:07,919
but the problem is that the new

133
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,240
generation

134
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:11,440
preferred not to use a facebook it's

135
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,720
more for our

136
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:17,120
older people

137
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:19,280
yeah if you want to show some full

138
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:22,560
product to a teenager it's probably

139
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,559
need to be an instagram

140
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,799
i guess all of you know about the face

141
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,919
filters

142
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:32,720
and sparky our studio

143
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:33,680
so as i already said we also have a

144
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,960
google ads

145
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:40,479
and a youtube is coming on with

146
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:43,120
its own try on features so for example

147
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:44,080
watching a video on youtube you can

148
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:48,000
immediately

149
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:51,599
experience some new

150
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,160
products on yourself but talking about a

151
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:56,800
makeup

152
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,800
it's really in interesting case

153
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:03,360
because when you're buying a makeup you

154
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:06,719
are not really buying

155
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:09,360
a makeup you are buying a a result

156
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,840
that the makeup delivers to you and it's

157
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,080
always

158
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,039
very difficult to buy for example

159
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,719
lipstick on

160
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:17,440
online because you never know how it

161
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:20,880
will fit to you

162
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:24,240
and uh here the xr comes up

163
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:27,360
because without

164
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,160
no need of expensive headsets no need of

165
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,319
install

166
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,840
and applications you can just grab your

167
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:34,960
phone and already

168
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,960
try it out

169
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,520
here with the newspapers experience is a

170
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:42,720
more like

171
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:45,919
worldwide used example it

172
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,639
it helps people to extend the

173
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:50,400
information

174
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:53,440
behind behind the print editions

175
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:57,599
like for example if yesterday's ever

176
00:07:53,440 --> 00:08:00,240
a football game and you did didn't they

177
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:00,800
well and you wasn't able to see it but

178
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,599
just

179
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,879
just do not buy a newspaper and see the

180
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:08,639
key

181
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:08,639
scenes which were happened

182
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:12,639
so as soon as we hear at javascript room

183
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:15,120
let's

184
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:17,199
see a bit of code but don't be scared

185
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,319
you don't need to know nothing specific

186
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:21,440
like an html

187
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:24,960
javascript it's really really simple

188
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:28,319
and i guess every one of you can do that

189
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:30,479
remember about augmented reality on the

190
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:33,760
web we still remember that it's

191
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:36,958
just a normal web page and

192
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:38,159
everything that is built in is happens

193
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:42,239
not in 2d

194
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:45,200
dimension but in a 3d address

195
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,080
and responsible for a 3d we have a web

196
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:49,200
graphics

197
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:52,399
library did someone try this out

198
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:53,680
already webgl okay you heard about that

199
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:55,920
perfect

200
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:57,359
you know that it could be quite like com

201
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:00,399
complicated right

202
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,200
but and uh actually this whole piece of

203
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:03,279
code is

204
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,279
required to write only one small

205
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:07,839
triangle

206
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,720
and you know that a 3d orb objects can

207
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:12,160
contain

208
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:15,600
thousands of them so we are not going to

209
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:19,760
dive deeper into this luckily for

210
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:23,120
us a lot of frameworks were

211
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:27,120
created like for example free freejas

212
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:29,519
or a frame a plague canvas babylon js

213
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,160
and and many others which are builded on

214
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:33,519
top of

215
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:36,640
webgl and help and helps us just

216
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:39,680
normal developers to create 3d

217
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:41,439
graphics much more faster

218
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:44,239
and there are different web air

219
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,800
extensions that help us to bring our 3d

220
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,839
object

221
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:51,519
into the real life like for example the

222
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:56,000
ar gs uh which example i will show you

223
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:58,640
soon it's an open source javascript live

224
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,279
library you can find it on a github just

225
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,920
using

226
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:02,320
a few lines of code you can immediately

227
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:05,439
bring

228
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:09,279
your model into the real world

229
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:12,800
it's well guys are also very interesting

230
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:16,240
projects from the guys from california

231
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:19,359
it's good for surface

232
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:22,880
as estimating image targets

233
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:26,240
and they are really step ahead of

234
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:26,880
web air solutions and as i already

235
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,000
mentioned

236
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:31,200
mentioned it's a apple quick look and a

237
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,839
model viewer from

238
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:37,360
google which is already built in into

239
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:37,360
your safari or chrome

240
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:42,079
so first before we start creating a

241
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:45,120
project we need to define

242
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:48,560
which type of project we want to create

243
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:51,519
15 minutes on mine okay i will

244
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,920
i will be fast we have an image markers

245
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:54,480
which

246
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,199
which is developed with free open source

247
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,079
live

248
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,399
library arcgis we have an image target

249
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:01,839
from

250
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:03,600
its wall it's free to could develop on

251
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:06,560
your

252
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:08,079
laptop but you will need to pay for a

253
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:11,599
license if you want to

254
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:15,040
push it to the audience and as i

255
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:18,160
already said as well has a surface it's

256
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:20,240
estimation next so

257
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:21,680
i will show you the short example using

258
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:24,720
the a-frame

259
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,120
did you already tried it it's very good

260
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,920
for

261
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:29,600
us lazy developers just to write few

262
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:33,199
lines of code and do not go

263
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:35,519
deeper into 3gs and web and webgl

264
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,560
it's also an open source and you don't

265
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:39,200
need to

266
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:40,959
learn a javascript to be able to write

267
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:45,440
it so you just go to

268
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:48,880
a website grab a cdn link and

269
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:51,440
you are able to create some experience

270
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:52,800
i will show you very quick quickly how

271
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:55,200
to put a basic

272
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,079
3d model on top of a hero marker which

273
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:59,760
is a default

274
00:11:56,079 --> 00:12:02,560
marker for ar and this is all the code

275
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,760
which is needed how many appliances uh

276
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:06,319
one two three four

277
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:07,279
like seven right which is seems not

278
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,320
really con

279
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:12,399
complicated let's go step by step

280
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,440
first as i already said we are going to

281
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:16,639
the a-frame

282
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:18,720
a web website grab a cdn link and add

283
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:21,760
into our head

284
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:25,680
then with an a-frame we

285
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:29,600
creating a scene and actually all

286
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:32,880
ar magic which we want to create will

287
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:36,839
be written inside after

288
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:38,480
we are adding an entity with our 3d

289
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:41,839
model

290
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,639
what is good for a frame they have a

291
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:45,760
assets

292
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:47,600
it's an assets management system it

293
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:50,720
helps our

294
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:54,160
assets to preload faster so

295
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:57,279
actually our 3d model will be

296
00:12:54,160 --> 00:13:01,360
loaded as soon as our page is loaded so

297
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:04,160
it's quietly fast then

298
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:05,440
actually if we load our model it could

299
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:08,800
happen that it's

300
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:12,079
very huge like for example if you just

301
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:15,199
export it from unity or blender it's

302
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:18,560
the meter one meter in

303
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:20,800
in unity is like 100 for a web so you

304
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:23,119
will would need to scale it many many

305
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:25,519
times down

306
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,959
also as soon as we have an animated

307
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:30,079
model we need to add

308
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:33,199
an extension for animation

309
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:36,959
and in here i use an a-frame

310
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:40,160
extras and add an animation mixer

311
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:45,518
attribute to my model so

312
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:48,319
finally let's add the augmented reality

313
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:50,480
for this for that i already said i'm

314
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:53,760
going to use args and the hero

315
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:56,000
markers hero markers are default for

316
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:58,720
augmented reality on a web and it is

317
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,120
some sort of qr codes which can be

318
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,639
easily

319
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:04,079
recognized by the camera on your

320
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:07,680
smartphone

321
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:10,959
for each markers we can define different

322
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:13,839
3d scenes so

323
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:14,479
to to be able to do that we will add

324
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:18,240
acid

325
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:22,720
lcd linked to ar gs into the head

326
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:26,000
then we are calling our args js

327
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:29,760
javascript into a scene and adds a

328
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,720
embedded ad attribute which will remove

329
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:34,480
a full screen

330
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:37,680
style con canvas from our

331
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:41,199
experience and the last we

332
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:44,000
are at heading a marquette tag tag

333
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:45,120
just just just to show that we want to

334
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,839
this model

335
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,800
seem under this particular marker and

336
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:50,800
this is

337
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,959
just a few lines of code and you can

338
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:54,719
already get the amazing experience on a

339
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:57,119
web

340
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:59,839
but it's actually not really practical

341
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,839
for

342
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:03,120
advertisement because we are living in a

343
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:06,160
new era

344
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:09,680
when you want to get everything

345
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:11,360
at once like our customers all

346
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:13,439
always said that they need the

347
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:16,399
information about the product

348
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:18,639
right here right now and they don't want

349
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:20,959
to click like a thousand buttons to be

350
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:23,040
able to see that

351
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:24,399
and it's possible like for example in

352
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:27,439
this case with

353
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:32,000
a model beer you can

354
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:35,360
easily add 3d experience to a billboard

355
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,600
so you you will not see the boring

356
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,880
build billboard advertising some bottles

357
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:42,000
of beer but you can

358
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:45,279
already see a beautiful picture

359
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:48,639
of or maybe some piece of storytelling

360
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:51,680
to get some atmosphere and try it on

361
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:53,040
or for example an advertisement of a

362
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:55,519
basketball players

363
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:56,800
but just do not throw the ball in the

364
00:15:55,519 --> 00:16:00,240
basket together with

365
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:03,279
him like hip yep

366
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,279
and you can throw it out

367
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:10,399
which is pretty fun um

368
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:12,880
i will show you one more experience

369
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:15,360
about a printing

370
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:18,240
advertisement that we already developed

371
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:20,800
for our eternal client

372
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,600
this this is how we can add augmented

373
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:24,959
reality

374
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:28,079
into a magazines and this works

375
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:31,439
pretty stable and as i said it's

376
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:33,839
accessible to any our user

377
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:37,839
who has a phone at least not older than

378
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:37,839
five years

379
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:43,199
but here uh i will show you different

380
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:46,479
potential issues you can

381
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:49,758
face with like for example uh different

382
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:52,079
magazines uh have different for

383
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:54,240
formats like for example the size of a

384
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:57,439
page can

385
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:58,720
can vary it can be thinner it can be

386
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:01,920
taller and

387
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:05,600
for each experience you need to

388
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:06,159
load appropriate marker so sometimes you

389
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:10,000
have like

390
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:13,439
a thousands not a thousand a hundred

391
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:16,959
image markers just just to show one

392
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:19,839
simple experience but how not

393
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:20,640
not to get lost sir here we are using a

394
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:23,438
urls

395
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,919
like for example in the url we can add

396
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:27,039
which

397
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:30,640
which issue a customer

398
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:33,440
will scan which page it will be and then

399
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,840
depend depending on that you can you can

400
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,480
load

401
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:38,240
appropriate marker and show appropriate

402
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:41,760
video

403
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:44,960
also the the most common issue is very

404
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,960
bad mobile connection

405
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:51,200
it it could be really a prop

406
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:52,080
a problem ask your your user to wait

407
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,960
until your

408
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,840
experience will load so please make it

409
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:59,120
easy

410
00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:02,879
and light and simple do do not put

411
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:06,159
very huge 3d mod models very very big

412
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,640
videos try to make it lighter than at

413
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:10,240
least

414
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:13,440
five megabytes also my

415
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:14,400
favorite issue is a battery low power

416
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:17,600
mode

417
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:21,120
sometimes iphones or android phones

418
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:22,159
are going in this uh battery saving mode

419
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,399
and then you

420
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,200
you realize that no experience is

421
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,760
working

422
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:31,120
and you start panic and calling to the

423
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:35,440
client that nothing is works tomorrow is

424
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:37,600
is a deadline and everything that

425
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,799
don't worry stop just check your battery

426
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:42,000
first because

427
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:46,320
low power power mode removes

428
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:49,039
all ar actions from your phone

429
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:50,960
just switch switch it off and it will

430
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:53,760
run

431
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:54,880
also don't don't create your experience

432
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:58,080
very com

433
00:18:54,880 --> 00:19:01,520
complex try to keep it simple

434
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:04,559
and clear to do your user

435
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:07,200
teach your user to navigate

436
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:09,039
with a basic steps like for example tap

437
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:12,480
here

438
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:15,679
move around flip your camera and

439
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:18,640
don't ask a user to make a lot of a move

440
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:19,280
or move movements because it's still a

441
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:22,720
new

442
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:23,200
technology and we need and we need to

443
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:26,480
teach

444
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:30,160
our customer how to use it so

445
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:32,640
as einstein said everything should

446
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,760
should be made as simple as as possible

447
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:37,360
but not

448
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:38,640
simpler and for us as a developers it's

449
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:42,320
also very

450
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:46,240
important to keep our code clean

451
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:49,918
please keep care about your consoles

452
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:54,559

any any of you can can go and

454
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:59,918
check a code and all of us will

00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:01,919
will want to be able to read it to

456

457
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:09,039
developed so keep your code in order

458
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:11,440
and yeah with your help we we can make

459
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:14,080

you're a bit shy it's cute ah thank you

464
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:40,000
i have a question um when you put these

465
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,799
markers in

466
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,159
in magazine in paper magazine uh how

467
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:48,000
well used

468
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:51,200
is it i mean 10 000 readers how many

469
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:54,640
use their er experience how many

470
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:55,679
users can use our ar experience in a

471
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:58,880
different

472
00:20:55,679 --> 00:21:02,320
magazines of course we are using google

473
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:06,400
analytics and google

474
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:09,760
tracks to and metrics to count

475
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:12,320
how many experiences are running

476
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:13,679
and actually it's like maybe twenty

477
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:16,559
percent

478
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:18,559
of the users just because it's also very

479
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:19,440
important to have a good design

480
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:23,120
experience

481
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:23,919
like if you if you point a qr code on

482
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:27,918
top

483
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:30,720
of of your ad use a user will

484
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:31,679
will see it immediate immediately but he

485
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:34,720
might think that

486
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:37,919
okay it's probably a link to a website

487
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:40,080
nothing important will happen right so

488
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:41,120
you need to leave like a small

489
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:45,439
instructions like

490
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:48,080
for example hey look here is air

491
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,480
experiment and also you you can promote

492
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:51,520
your

493
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:52,559
air experience in different uh social

494
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:55,840
media channels

495
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:59,120
like for example with an influencers you

496
00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:02,639
you can just record a small

497
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:06,399
live video talks about

498
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:09,760
how his he's using ar how it's uh

499
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:12,799
seemed easy how how is light

500
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:16,158
and working on yeah so

501
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:16,158
unfortunately not a lot of people

502
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,720
hello yes uh thanks for the presentation

503
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:22,080
uh with the yeah i've got a very simple

504
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,919
question like with the billboards how do

505
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:25,520
you attract the user to even know that

506
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:26,960
there is an experience to be had

507
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:29,440
i wouldn't know if i was just walking

508
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:30,320
past the like the beer billboard to even

509
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:34,720
get my phone out

510
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:38,080
to sort of um absorb the experience

511
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:40,640
yeah so how how we can attract a user

512
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:42,080
for this particular build a bill a

513
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:45,120
