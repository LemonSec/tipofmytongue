1
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:09,280
today

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:13,040
with oliver's talk about

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:13,040
challenges in modern visualization

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,760
thank you hello everyone so i'm oliver

5
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,080
and

6
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,199
as you said i will talk a bit about the

7
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,359
new challenges

8
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:24,800
uh that's in fact already existing but

9
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:28,519
are also coming

10
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:31,679
in the vectorization world so uh

11
00:00:28,519 --> 00:00:34,559
first um i'm

12
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:35,280
the ceo of h a company doing open source

13
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:38,000
software

14
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:40,320
in characterization things in general

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,360
i'm a former system administrator

16
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:46,960
uh i'm using then since a while now

17
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:48,640
so i'm more zen guy

18
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,239
i created the project called zen

19
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:53,520
orchestra which is a

20
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:54,320
backup management solution for initially

21
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,520
zen server

22
00:00:54,320 --> 00:01:00,559
and then xpng which is also a project i

23
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:02,960
started as a fork of zen server and

24
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:04,080
as i said earlier this project is now

25
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,840
hosted inside

26
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:10,158
the linux foundation thanks to lars

27
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,760
if you want to have access to some

28
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:14,240
details of the presentation

29
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,360
then it's available on this link so

30
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,839
sometimes i will

31
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,119
go in some deep details and if you want

32
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,960
to to learn more

33
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:23,280
you will be able to take a look at those

34
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,279
links

35
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:29,119
so i'm not someone really uh

36
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:31,039
deeply technical so i'm not a colonel

37
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:34,240
hacker or zen hacker

38
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:36,479
but i'm more as i said from the user

39
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:39,759
side of visualization so

40
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:42,479
the thing is as my position of you know

41
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:43,759
selling support for open source solution

42
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:45,520
i'm a lot on the field

43
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:47,040
uh it could be at this kind of

44
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:50,640
conferences but also

45
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:52,799
uh meeting with uh developers or people

46
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,399
who might actually decide to take this

47
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:57,600
or that solution

48
00:01:54,399 --> 00:02:00,159
so this gave me a way to i think

49
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,719
uh feel a bit what's going on in this

50
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:03,520
world

51
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:06,399
so that's a non-technical talk but more

52
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:10,239
an overview on what's going on

53
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:13,599
and uh a funny thing i i hear a lot

54
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:16,319
on the field is that people seems to

55
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:17,599
forget that the authorization is almost

56
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:20,640
everywhere because people

57
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:21,440
said i would say people's more exec in

58
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,640
general but

59
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:26,400
anyway people said i'm reading or seeing

60
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,160
a lot of stuff about

61
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,520
you know the trend of going everything

62
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:32,879
to the cloud using

63
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:35,599
orchestration whatever and without even

64
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:37,280
noticing it they are very likely using

65
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:38,160
not them directly but the thing that

66
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,640
they are using

67
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,359
are interpreterization so i think it's

68
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:44,079
somehow

69
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:46,160
a good sign that uh it's pretty

70
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,480
everywhere and even now in places that

71
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,680
we

72
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:52,000
didn't suspect maybe a few years ago but

73
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,599
against that it means that there is new

74
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,080
challenges that will come with this

75
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:59,280
position of authorization

76
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,319
so those challenges are i mean three

77
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,440
main topics

78
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:06,000
the big one is obviously security

79
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,959
i think you might know why about the

80
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,879
performances

81
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:14,400
and finally about all the new use cases

82
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:15,120
so what about security uh when i use the

83
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,840
word we

84
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,280
i'm not talking about you know very

85
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,280
technical people or

86
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,440
people are aware or security researchers

87
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:26,560
but the the you know the average

88
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:30,000
admin or the average exec maybe

89
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:32,560
uh the trend that we all uh so

90
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,159
is coming from the layer one the

91
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,360
hardware and then adding more and more

92
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:38,000
layers on top so

93
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,400
i mean there is uh an explanation

94
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,799
because

95
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,080
it's easier for people to do some stuff

96
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:45,280
uh because you will have

97
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,080
more abstraction but the thing is by

98
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,840
going more and more

99
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,440
on top then you tend to forget what's

100
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,040
going on on the bottom

101
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,480
so for example i started with

102
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,319
virtualization then

103
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,560
public cloud then orchestration

104
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:59,599
containers containers orchestration

105
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:01,280
serverless uh but it seems that somehow

106
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:02,159
your code has to run on some hardware

107
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,439
somewhere

108
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:08,720
in the end and even developerless

109
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:10,079
so this is a thing uh on twitter if you

110
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,519
click on the link

111
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,879
there's some people that can imagine

112
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,640
that you can get rid of all the

113
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:17,120
developers forever and just

114
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:19,440
in few clicks create a great application

115
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:22,000
that scales et cetera et cetera so

116
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,280
in the head of a lot of people uh we are

117
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,800
going far away from

118
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:29,758
the middle and in the meantime

119
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:31,120
another phenomenon is happening and you

120
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:34,240
probably know that

121
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,720
that in the hardware there is more and

122
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,280
more

123
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,960
software somehow so it's like car

124
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:41,599
manufacturers you know

125
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,080
in your modern car you have tons of

126
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,720
software

127
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,840
that you didn't have maybe 20 years ago

128
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,919
and it means that

129
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,599
companies focusing on hardware are

130
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:52,719
delivering more and more software

131
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,440
and somehow those teams working on those

132
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,080
features

133
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:57,680
on the hardware doing this low-level

134
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:01,120
software aren't really

135
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:02,560
sometimes have not really priorities

136
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,919
about security

137
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:09,440
so we will see with an example later

138
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:11,758
so in short we again

139
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:13,360
not especially you but we thought that

140
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:15,120
our hardware was secure

141
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,560
we thought that when you purchase

142
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,360
something uh

143
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,720
from dell hp whatever then it's

144
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,000
something that you just put in your

145
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,680
infrastructure and

146
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,120
you don't touch it and you will add all

147
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,840
your layers on top

148
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,639
but if you do that nowadays uh you will

149
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,359
forget about

150
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:32,320
the foundations the foundation is the

151
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,160
layer one and

152
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,440
what's going on if you have weak

153
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,919
foundations

154
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,880
and have a lot of stacks on top of that

155
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:42,639
well the result

156
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:45,039
is not great if as you can see here

157
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:46,320
this is exactly the same metaphor it's

158
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:48,960
you have weak foundation

159
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:50,320
and all the layers on top are going down

160
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,479
because if you are

161
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,440
be able to hack on the low level then

162
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:56,639
you can

163
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:58,400
get everything what you have on top

164
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:00,960
so what about those problems on the

165
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:03,758
hardware well i think you know them

166
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:05,840
right in the silicon you have all the

167
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:08,720
issues with those

168
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:10,719
at least intel cpus but also some others

169
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,280
but the biggest impact was on intel

170
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,039
stuff

171
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,318
so i want details i think you know some

172
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:17,599
of them and if you don't

173
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:19,520
google them so this is right

174
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,960
in the silicon alliances because it

175
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:24,799
means that

176
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:26,880
it won't be able to to change tomorrow

177
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,560
what about bmc's so bmc's if you don't

178
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:32,000
know the word exactly that's

179
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:34,080
your ilo idrac your extra

180
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,919
small cpu and network card on your

181
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,039
motherboard that's allowing you to do

182
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:38,719
very cool stuff

183
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:41,199
in the data center so you can install

184
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:43,520
you know an iso remotely

185
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:45,039
update your firmware sport cycle the the

186
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:48,080
machine so that's great

187
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:49,919
but in the last 10 years we had a huge

188
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:53,599
amount of cves

189
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:57,039
on security flows in those hardware and

190
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:59,120
this is uh again from the hardware

191
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:00,159
at this lower level you can access to a

192
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,840
ton of stuff

193
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:07,120
even if your top players are secure

194
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:08,880
so we learned that

195
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,880
even your hardware what you think it's

196
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:12,960
purely hardware must be updated often

197
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,560
like you do for your operating system

198
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,719
like you do for

199
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,919
your application et cetera et cetera you

200
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,479
might also

201
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:22,400
uh decide to disable some features on

202
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:24,159
your cpus for example hyper threadings

203
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,159
to be secure against some side channel

204
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,639
attacks

205
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,599
and again i i repeat that because it's

206
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:31,919
really important

207
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:33,039
the security should be considered as a

208
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:36,240
whole so

209
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:38,240
if you have a problem on one state and

210
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,440
lower is the layer when you have the

211
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,720
security issue

212
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,759
bigger the impact will be those side

213
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,319
channel attacks and

214
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:47,759
hardware bugs are here to stay by that i

215
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:50,080
mean that you won't change

216
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:51,199
all your hardware tomorrow but even if

217
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,758
you can do that

218
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:54,720
i'm pretty sure that we continue to find

219
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:57,120
some flows

220
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,080
in the current silicon designs for a lot

221
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,800
of reasons

222
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,960
one of them for example is that x86 is

223
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,960
very complicated and then

224
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:06,239
we could continue researchers continue

225
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:09,198
to find new

226
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:11,599
issues so it it will stay the problem

227
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:14,080
won't vanish tomorrow

228
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:14,719
so okay so i talked a bit about some

229
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:17,758
general stuff

230
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:20,800
what about the impact of everything

231
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:24,639
like i said on virtualization

232
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:25,599
so um funny enough the first answer

233
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:28,000
might be not

234
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:29,680
especially on the technical side but you

235
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,240
need first because you know that you

236
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,240
will

237
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,279
have some new flaws coming you need to

238
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,120
have a

239
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,399
great security workload for your project

240
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,320
so for example

241
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:40,000
for the zen project there is a really

242
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:43,440
great security process

243
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,279
so if you want to see what it is

244
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,880
exactly basically it's somehow a

245
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:48,959
flowchart or

246
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:50,399
a checklist or at least a process that

247
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:51,839
you will guard you then if you tomorrow

248
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:53,600
you got a big problem then

249
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:55,680
you will go how to handle this in the

250
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:58,080
project so the first answer might be

251
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:00,000
just a way to organize the project to

252
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:02,959
react to these problems

253
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,959
also something that's

254
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:07,200
really important is to have a good

255
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,920
design documentation so how your

256
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:11,360
hypervisor

257
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:11,839
is working how it works and because if

258
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,760
you

259
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:15,680
have a great design documentation i mean

260
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:17,439
not going in the full details

261
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,199
it means that people from outside for

262
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,600
example security researchers

263
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:24,000
can tell you okay i'm not inside

264
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,200
authorization but i'm in cpu security

265
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,640
and i see that

266
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,200
through your design documentation that

267
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:32,640
you could probably mitigate this or that

268
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:34,560
uh by just removing this or adding that

269
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:36,560
so that's why it's more important than

270
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:39,279
ever to have a clear explanation

271
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:40,880
how it works and obviously the usual

272
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:43,600
community stuff that we

273
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,800
know in open source but for hypervisor

274
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,440
it means

275
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:49,040
for example a great communication

276
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,160
between different projects for example

277
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,399
kvm and zen

278
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:54,560
because more brains means more ways to

279
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:55,839
tackle issues and even if there is some

280
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:58,239
design differences

281
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:59,680
uh there is some influence on how to

282
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:02,959
work on a problem

283
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:04,479
and how to to solve it so for example

284
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:06,000
i have in mind this course scheduling

285
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:08,160
which is an interesting thing

286
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,720
that have been you know uh thoughts by

287
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,360
people in the kernel in kvm and also in

288
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,800
zen

289
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:17,760
and mixing ideas is always great

290
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:18,000
and external people so it goes back to

291
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,079
the

292
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,920
good design documentation so you have

293
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:25,359
more easily people on board

294
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:28,800
telling you what's what's wrong on your

295
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:32,399
on your solution so regarding uh

296
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:33,839
the technical solution the first one is

297
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:35,120
because it's more and more complex and

298
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:36,880
there is more and more flows

299
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,640
uh you need to modularize the code so it

300
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:40,880
means that you let

301
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,399
uh the user deciding to use some parts

302
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:44,079
of the code or notes so it can be

303
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:45,680
mitigations but it could be also

304
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:47,519
features of the hypervisor

305
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,800
so people we use for example strip

306
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:50,880
version of

307
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,319
uh in this case then for open xt which

308
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,880
is a project

309
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,360
used in you know uh defense sector

310
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:58,320
because

311
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:59,760
it's the attack surface is really lower

312
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:04,079
than the full feature

313
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:06,000
thing so the other issue with that if

314
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:07,279
you gave a lot of choice to users then

315
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,720
you have to guide them to

316
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:12,720
to tell them if you want a security then

317
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,079
you might choose this or that and if you

318
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:17,920
don't care then you can use

319
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:20,239
all the features etc also we saw that

320
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:22,240
updating the low level software is

321
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:25,279
pretty important and to do that

322
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:27,120
uh you must have ways to to do it uh in

323
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:28,079
a way that won't disrupt your everyday

324
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,760
operation

325
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:31,359
so we know that if it's hard to update

326
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:33,920
that people won't update

327
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:35,600
so giving you a few examples so applying

328
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:38,079
microcode to your cpu without

329
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,680
doing a reboot it's called uh late

330
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:41,760
microcode loading then that's

331
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:43,680
interesting to avoid any production

332
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:45,920
disruption uh live patching

333
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,519
live upgrade i think it's called live

334
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:49,920
update by uh iw

335
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:52,079
aws people they contributed to zen

336
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:54,240
allowing to

337
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:55,120
make a major upgrade of zen version in

338
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,440
live without

339
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:59,440
on a physical machine without having to

340
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,880
uh even to reboot or

341
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,040
disrupt the vm so that's really

342
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,800
interesting if you are if you want to

343
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:07,439
get the details again

344
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:09,040
click on the link and on the technical

345
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,440
solution i will be brief but

346
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:13,360
in short you probably heard some of them

347
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,200
so the goal is to have a better

348
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,600
isolation and to avoid

349
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:19,279
all side channels attack so there is a

350
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,079
lot of strategy it's a non-exhaustive

351
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:22,399
list

352
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:24,000
uh there's a lot of different approach

353
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:27,440
but uh

354
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,600
we have a lot of ideas on how to improve

355
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,600
that

356
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:33,680
so what about the performances and there

357
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,720
is a link between the security and

358
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,959
performances

359
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:39,279
and the link is you must continue to

360
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:41,518
work on the perf side if you

361
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:42,399
uh are also working on security because

362
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:44,399
if you forget

363
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:45,760
about performances and doing you know

364
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:47,040
more and more mitigation then you will

365
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:49,519
have a problem

366
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,240
because uh uh there is always you know a

367
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:52,160
balance

368
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:54,000
on security and performances sometimes

369
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:55,279
you can have both but it's not the usual

370
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,600
case

371
00:12:55,279 --> 00:13:01,439
um i think uh what i didn't

372
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:03,440
write it but the idea also is to have

373
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,440
benchmark tools to be sure that

374
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,880
for example with the ci platform to be

375
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:09,120
sure that your modification

376
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:11,120
won't ruin all the performances of your

377
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:13,839
hypervisor

378
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,959
on the compute side as you may know cpus

379
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:18,320
are bigger and bigger

380
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:21,439
at least in the x86 world so

381
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:23,920
you also must have to

382
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:25,519
maybe rethink some parts of the code

383
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,680
because you need to

384
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:32,240
adapt to the massive number of cores

385
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:32,239
that are existing right now in the cpus

386
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:36,560
uh on the storage side well it's not a

387
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:39,040
new trend per se but

388
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:40,560
in the end we have cheaper nvme drives

389
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,519
and some storage stack have been made

390
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:44,719
when we only had

391
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:47,610
hdds so they are wearing bottlenecks

392
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,800
but now for example an nvme drive

393
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:50,639
[Music]

394
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:52,719
is able to wait because the cpu is too

395
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:55,440
busy to write stuff on it

396
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,880
so you have to think uh on the way to to

397
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:59,920
write on your disk

398
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:02,480
without making syscalls uh using

399
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:04,160
modern libraries like your urine etc but

400
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,519
it's also from something that you need

401
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,800
to do carefully because

402
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:08,800
it's always the balance between

403
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:10,479
isolation and performances so again

404
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,319
uh benchmark when you make some

405
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:16,160
modification there

406
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:18,399
about new use cases um

407
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,199
it's pretty funny because uh for some of

408
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:21,279
them i didn't

409
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:23,199
so them coming so for example the embed

410
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:25,040
world uh people in the embed will really

411
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:27,199
love virtualization because it allows to

412
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:29,599
make isolation on software level

413
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:31,040
uh so it might be cheaper in some cases

414
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:34,160
but the

415
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:35,920
challenge by doing that for a project

416
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:38,240
like for example the zen project

417
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:40,079
is the compliance because you need to

418
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:42,079
have you know standards of security

419
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:42,560
standards especially inside the airspace

420
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:45,359
or

421
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:47,119
automotive projects so you need to have

422
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:49,360
a kind of framework to validate

423
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,959
what you have you know be compliant with

424
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,760
the standards without disrupting the way

425
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:53,680
you are

426
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:56,319
building software every day again

427
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:57,920
finding the right balance

428
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,279
you have new architectures and i think

429
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,240
that's really interesting because

430
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:02,160
there's

431
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:04,000
a lot of great things to get from there

432
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:07,120
so risk five for example

433
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:09,120
uh there's a lot of talks about it and i

434
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,839
think having for example porting zen to

435
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,600
it

436
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:13,839
might be really something great in the

437
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,920
future uh we saw some more arm

438
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:16,959
deployments in the server world and i

439
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,639
think

440
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:20,479
i personally think that would have been

441
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:21,920
a thing maybe you know eight years ago

442
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,720
something like that but it didn't but

443
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,399
maybe

444
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,160
this time it will be a bit different

445
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:30,399
because the

446
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:30,399
the performance level is is pretty great

447
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:36,638
okay so uh in conclusion i

448
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:37,519
think that's my opinion by seeing

449
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:40,880
everything

450
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:44,560
that uh um virtualization will

451
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:46,000
see more uh challenge than ever because

452
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,758
everything is more complicated

453
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:51,199
especially in the server world and

454
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:52,560
in the x86 world and we have to take

455
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:56,000
into account

456
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:57,518
uh the security that isn't maybe great

457
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,079
on some hardware

458
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:00,959
on the bmc's so all the physical layers

459
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:04,160
should be

460
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:06,399
uh you know um be able to be updated

461
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:08,719
quickly without disrupting everything

462
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:09,440
so as the layer just on top of that

463
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,480
there is some

464
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:14,160
uh heavy responsibilities to do that

465
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,920
something that just works because

466
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:18,639
otherwise the overhead

467
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:20,160
uh won't be contained and virtualization

468
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:22,160
is a great tool because that's really

469
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:24,560
flexible you can do a lot of

470
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,839
uh great stuff with it like you know

471
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:28,239
migrate or have

472
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:29,839
your hardware abstraction isolation etc

473
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:32,160
etc but it will

474
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:34,240
stay relevant as long as the work is

475
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:36,719
done to avoid all the issues on the

476
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:40,000
layer on the bottom

477
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:42,480
uh and this uh this work

478
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,360
which is i think more and more important

479
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,920
and and

480
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:47,759
huge nowadays because as i said there is

481
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:50,319
porting to new architecture

482
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:50,880
uh all the security work etc that will

483
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:54,639
need

484
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:57,680
uh uh more bigger collaborations between

485
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:58,240
security researchers or uh benchmark

486
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:01,439
people

487
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:03,440
multiple open source projects uh and

488
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,559
i think this is in the open source world

489
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,400
the challenge is to have

490
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:07,760
everyone on board to find solutions

491
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,640
together because

492
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:11,760
uh one project on one side won't be able

493
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:15,360
to to keep up

494
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:17,919
alone so it's all um a way to

495
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:20,719
continue to nurture those communities to

496
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:23,760
work together that's really important

497
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:24,880
but uh the reward to do that is pretty

498
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:27,919
high because it means

499
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:30,160
that if we can do that if we can

500
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:31,919
keep up the pace but if we can also work

501
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,360
with people at the limits on the

502
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:36,400
hardware and software

503
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:38,719
we could you know not only uh use

504
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:40,960
virtualization in new use cases but also

505
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:42,480
maybe bring a lot of innovation that

506
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:45,200
will help the transition to

507
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:46,160
to three to thrive in this world so uh

508
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:49,039
there is a lot of

509
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:50,160
opportunities on those current kvm and

510
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:52,640
zen projects

511
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:54,080
and i think we will see more and more

512
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,280
stuff coming and the limit on the

513
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:58,080
hardware and software

514
00:17:55,280 --> 00:18:00,000
because in the last six months or so i

515
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:02,879
saw more and more companies created

516
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,600
working on very low level things like

517
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,720
cpus

518
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:07,439
architecture or even building x86

519
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,799
servers

520
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:14,160
so people that aren't dell or hpe etc

521
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:15,760
you know there is somehow

522
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,679
some people want to disrupt a bit of

523
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,559
this world so i have a feeling that it

524
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:20,400
will continue

525
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:22,080
and then we should take a look at that

526
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,320
because if we've been there

527
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:26,240
pretty early in this stage of research

528
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:31,360
we can it can lead to really

529
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:31,360
interesting things um i'm done

530
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,918
thank you

531
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:43,840
so if you have questions go ahead

532
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:50,639
no question so that was pretty clear

533
00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:03,839
perfect

534
00:18:57,570 --> 00:19:03,839
