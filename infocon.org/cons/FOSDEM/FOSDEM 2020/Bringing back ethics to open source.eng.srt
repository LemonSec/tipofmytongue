1
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:09,679
first of all a disclaimer

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,440
uh number one is i am not a lawyer right

3
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:12,240
so we're going to talk about ethics and

4
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,840
licensing

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,920
so that's the first disclaimer and the

6
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:17,279
second one this is as you can see a work

7
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:20,800
in progress

8
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:24,400
right uh so i i don't

9
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:27,760
expect to have all of the answers um

10
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:29,278
and um also

11
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:32,320
please consider this as a way of like

12
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:32,320
starting a conversation

13
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,640
does it work well it's working there

14
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:39,760
just it's not presenting

15
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:45,440
i don't know why oh

16
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:47,599
wonderful okay uh

17
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:49,280
so what are we going to talk about in a

18
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,559
very short amount of time now first of

19
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,680
all a bit of context

20
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:53,038
i'm going to try to give a different

21
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,160
perspective on the open source

22
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,160
definition

23
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,160
uh we're going to look very quickly at

24
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,160
prior art

25
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,959
and what's missing from it uh we're

26
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,358
going to look at the role of

27
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:06,080
corporations in this whole story

28
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:06,880
um and what do we sort of expect to get

29
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,880
out of

30
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:11,360
this ethical licensing and the sort of

31
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,880
the suggestions i'm making here

32
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,720
if we have time to look at critiques and

33
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,280
next steps and we'll probably answer

34
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:19,039
questions

35
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:20,159
in the corridor uh so first a bit of

36
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,840
context

37
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,280
why are we talking about this right now

38
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,159
we're talking about this right now

39
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,479
because

40
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:28,880
i'm sure a lot of you started um being

41
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:30,479
involved in software and open source

42
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,000
uh to some degree because of the

43
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:34,479
positive impact we

44
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,479
thought it could provide to the world um

45
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:36,880
and we're sort of looking at the space

46
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:38,400
now

47
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,000
and i mean at least some of us at least

48
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,840
for me and basically

49
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,119
wondering what went wrong along the way

50
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,560
and what we can try to do

51
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:47,680
to fix this um there's also when you

52
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,240
start to see what's

53
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,920
happening with technology right now uh

54
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,798
historical unprecedent

55
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,520
of technology being used um in horrible

56
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:58,479
ways

57
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:59,679
um in the past and this is also uh you

58
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:02,000
know for example i'm thinking about

59
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:06,640
punch cards used by a nazi germany

60
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:09,119
to administer concentration camps and so

61
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,119
keep going

62
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:15,040
and so this is also um a uh you know

63
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,560
obviously a concern you know what

64
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,720
i'm just gonna do it without slides but

65
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:23,840
i just will need the notes

66
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:23,840
oh i'm just gonna take my phone my uh

67
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,720
i'm just gonna seriously i'm just gonna

68
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,879
take my laptop and you'll have a look at

69
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:36,160
the slides afterwards

70
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:38,640
i think that's just the best option we

71
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,640
have right now

72
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:44,720
um so uh there was a desire to do

73
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:48,840
something about this

74
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:51,840
issue um through

75
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,840
um

76
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:57,120
this is a joke right whoever cursed

77
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:59,359
toby's talk it's not cool

78
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,959
i'm gonna go under here no seriously

79
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:04,000
seriously you know what let's just close

80
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:07,440
this i know

81
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,280
yeah no seriously

82
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,800
some of the equipment here is magical

83
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,840
yeah some of it yeah

84
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:17,120
and uh this hdmi cable is very magical

85
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:20,560
i can okay i'm just gonna hold this here

86
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:22,560
uh all right

87
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,239
so there's been previous attempts at

88
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:27,280
sort of like um

89
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:30,560
bringing uh so sorry uh some

90
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:32,080
uh there has been some attempts to um

91
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,680
bring these ethical concerns into

92
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,120
licensing um

93
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,200
and there's also been quite some

94
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,319
pushback from uh what you can call

95
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,480
gatekeepers

96
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:42,238
um and that's sort of normal because

97
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,399
like their function is actually to be

98
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:48,080
keeping what open sources so you know

99
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,080
it's sort of fair to some degree

100
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:54,799
um so quickly uh three definitions

101
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:57,518
uh osi is the open source initiative

102
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:59,599
it's a non-profit that's responsible

103
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:01,120
for certifying what is and what is not

104
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:03,439
an open source license

105
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,280
the open source definition is a set of

106
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:08,720
10 criteria that the osi

107
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:11,439
uses to decide whether an open source

108
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:12,400
um sorry whether a license is open

109
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:14,319
source or not

110
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:17,920
and the four freedoms is sort of like

111
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:17,920
the equivalent for free software

112
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:22,160
um so the first thing i want to do is

113
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:24,080
sort of like consider

114
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,440
that we could actually de-sacralize the

115
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:29,039
open source definition

116
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:31,040
right um and for that um

117
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,040
a few data points well one it was

118
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:36,160
created sort of like in a hurry

119
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:38,320
20 years ago uh it was lifted from the

120
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,360
debian free software guidelines and it

121
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:42,719
has never been

122
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:45,360
updated since right um and that's

123
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,000
uh in contrast to for example the free

124
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,120
the

125
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,880
for freedom uh which uh started

126
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,960
at this three right so there's been

127
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:56,080
updates there um and there is

128
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:58,880
um you know other um

129
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,880
seriously drop it

130
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:05,280
uh there's been uh you know there's a

131
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:07,039
precedence here too for example uh we

132
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,638
talk a lot about the amendments of the

133
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:10,080
american constitution

134
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:12,160
and the amendments where it's in the

135
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,039
name they're like things that were added

136
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,720
afterwards and

137
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:16,960
they're making changes to their original

138
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,560
document right um and another one that

139
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,479
comes to mind that's closer to home is

140
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,080
uh that was also built in like uh

141
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:24,000
like 10 days or something is uh

142
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,840
javascript right ecmascript

143
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,039
which has also seen like lots of

144
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,280
versions where now like

145
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:30,880
i think last year was version 10. like

146
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:33,440
it's they're even numbered by the euros

147
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,440
at this point

148
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:40,479
um the other way of looking at the

149
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:42,560
um open source definition in my opinion

150
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:44,960
is also to consider the privilege

151
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,639
position that its authors were in when

152
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:49,280
they actually wrote about it

153
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:51,199
it's a bunch of white male dudes and

154
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:53,919
silicon valley was engineering

155
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:55,199
uh engineer salaries right um and i

156
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:55,599
think that's something to take in mind

157
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,400
too

158
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,120
if instead the open source definition

159
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,840
had been

160
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,600
uh written by say people that were

161
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:05,919
involved uh you know whose

162
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,960
ancestors were involved in the holocaust

163
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:09,039
or and you know

164
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:11,120
and had any kind of different background

165
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:15,199
on this one it's probable

166
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:16,800
that um you know ethical criteria would

167
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:18,840
have been built in from the start and we

168
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:21,440
would not be having this conversation

169
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:23,758
today

170
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,639
and i think it's fair to ask also the

171
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,759
question

172
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:30,720
as to whether open source has succeeded

173
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:31,840
because of the open source definition or

174
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,560
to some degree

175
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:36,000
in spite of it right and if you look at

176
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,960
you know the proliferation of open

177
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,600
source and how peop

178
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:41,599
how people actually choose software uh

179
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:44,400
it's developers that essentially

180
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,720
pick uh software that they want to use

181
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,000
and

182
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:50,400
sort of you know de facto choose a

183
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,400
license

184
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,039
so um prior arts prior art i want to

185
00:06:54,720 --> 00:07:00,240
look at two different projects that

186
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:03,840
have attempted to look at this

187
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:07,680
the first one is douglas crockford's um

188
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:10,318
good not evil license um

189
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,880
that was basically the mit license was

190
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:13,520
on

191
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,240
a good not evil clause added to it which

192
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,960
read

193
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,800
the software shall be used for good not

194
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,799
evil

195
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,840
obviously the problem with this is it

196
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,560
leaves

197
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:26,000
um the interpretation of good and evil

198
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,759
to the courts

199
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,199
which is you know a legal nightmare that

200
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:31,680
no one really wants to get in

201
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:33,360
and so basically uh crockford talks

202
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,880
about this in a really nice video

203
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,720
where he's basically saying he's getting

204
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:40,479
calls on a regular basis

205
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:44,319
from um attorneys at different

206
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:47,758
tech firms that ask that ask him to

207
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:48,160
um you know make uh change the license

208
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:51,280
or

209
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:53,840
actually make uh expect exceptions for

210
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:55,599
like their particular use case the video

211
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,758
is online it's really funny he actually

212
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:58,159
he's he's a really funny speaker so it's

213
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:01,199
it's

214
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:04,400
well worth having a look at it we'll

215
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:04,400
have the links in the slides

216
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,919
oh yeah

217
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:11,520
the second one is uh the hippocratic

218
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:15,440
license

219
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:18,799
by um caroline have to actually check

220
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:22,800
her masks

221
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:26,720
yes um caroline adamke

222
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,520
i didn't want to mispronounce her last

223
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:31,440
name

224
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:34,079
um and um so it does a bunch of

225
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,640
uh things that in my opinion are really

226
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,880
right and

227
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,838
really a real progress on the existing

228
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,679
situation

229
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:41,599
first of all it actually solves the

230
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:43,679
problem of defining evil

231
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:45,440
by basically relying on human rights

232
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:46,319
which is just you know a well understood

233
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,680
body of law

234
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,920
that's been ratified in a bunch of

235
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,719
countries it's like that's being used

236
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,319
quite a bit

237
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,000
and doesn't have like sort of the

238
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,720
definition of problems um

239
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,560
and it also doesn't conflict with the

240
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,120
criteria five and six of the open source

241
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:02,479
definition

242
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:05,120
by really narrowing down um

243
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,240
um what actually is not permitted and

244
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,560
making it like

245
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,160
specific to actions and not people

246
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:13,119
groups or feel of endover

247
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:15,040
right and my argument is like genocide

248
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:17,920
is not a field of endeavor

249
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:19,839
which i think like you know everyone

250
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:22,399
should pretty much agree with this

251
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:24,240
um the problem though is that it leaves

252
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:25,279
the definition of human rights violation

253
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,519
to the courts

254
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:28,480
which obviously is a problem when it's a

255
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:29,920
government

256
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,519
that's actually making the human rights

257
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:33,120
violation right if it's also the

258
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:34,959
government's courts that are making that

259
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,279
decision so that's like

260
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:38,959
sort of you know not really enough and

261
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:40,000
the other part which i think is actually

262
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:41,760
a deeper problem

263
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,720
is it doesn't have a good strong

264
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,720
adoption story

265
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,480
um and so you know if we look at

266
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:51,439
actually what's missing

267
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:54,080
well one of it is the reliance on an

268
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:56,080
internationally recognized and respected

269
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,120
body that defines actual violations of

270
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:00,640
human rights

271
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:03,519
right there are such uh um bodies

272
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:05,040
in geneva uh the problem is they're kind

273
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:07,680
of staffed with

274
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,160
uh representatives of countries that

275
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,800
have a

276
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:12,240
terrible terrible track record with uh

277
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,920
human rights violation

278
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,600
so you know that that's sort of a

279
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:18,719
problem that still needs to be

280
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:20,720
solved um and then

281
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:23,360
like what's really missing is community

282
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:26,399
buy-in and multi-stakeholder support

283
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,600
so the idea here is that you know if you

284
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:31,440
want to change the way

285
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:33,120
um licensing is done you can't just do

286
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,680
that on your side you have to engage

287
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,680
with the

288
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,719
community get maintainers on board get

289
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,719
projects on board

290
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,480
get non-profits like the osi the apache

291
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:44,720
foundation etc on board

292
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,720
and also get corporations on board

293
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:48,479
the third thing that's missing is a

294
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:51,199
clear path from existing licenses

295
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,760
to uh ethical ones because again like

296
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,519
having an

297
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:55,279
you know having the option of ethical

298
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:58,240
licenses on the side

299
00:10:55,279 --> 00:11:00,000
um is good but making sure that the

300
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:03,279
industry moves

301
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,600
together towards a more ethical future

302
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:07,120
is much better so you need actual

303
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,519
tooling you need

304
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:11,360
uh you know uh to figure out the legal

305
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:12,000
aspects you need education around these

306
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,079
issues

307
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,839
to actually make this transformation

308
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:19,439
right and the fourth point

309
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:20,480
is that as a community we need a mindset

310
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:24,000
shift

311
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:26,480
to redefine uh the norm of how we build

312
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,360
open source as being respectful of human

313
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,640
rights

314
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:33,839
it's not just the idea of

315
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:35,839
basically allowing a few projects to

316
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:39,120
have such licenses

317
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:40,160
it's reconsidering how we work and so

318
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,680
it's really

319
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:43,519
to me what's important is that that

320
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:46,719
mindset shift between

321
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:50,079
this is a you know a fringe

322
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:52,399
uh issue that a few people care about to

323
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:53,359
this is the norm of how open source

324
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:57,279
software

325
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:59,040
is built

326
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:00,560
so i mentioned corporations and

327
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:02,079
corporation approval and i'm sure a lot

328
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:04,000
of you were like you know what the

329
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:05,439
why like why do we care why is this

330
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,519
important um

331
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:13,120
and well the truth is if corporations

332
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:15,040
can't use the licenses of open source

333
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,399
they're just never going to get traction

334
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:19,279
right

335
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:20,160
and the other interesting aspect to me

336
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:22,639
is that

337
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:24,800
a lot of corporations are in somewhat of

338
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:28,079
a prisoner's dilemma here

339
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:29,439
in which they would gladly stop having

340
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:31,920
to actually

341
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,880
provide software to a particular

342
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,079
organization's

343
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:36,160
you know government organizations so

344
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:38,800
they're doing something really evil but

345
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:40,079
if they do that they risk losing like

346
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,199
the rest of the contracts that the

347
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:43,839
government does

348
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:45,920
right and so providing them was sort of

349
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:48,800
like a get out of jail card a joker

350
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:50,240
right where they can say well we'd love

351
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,240
to be able to give you that too but

352
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:54,800
we're not allowed to

353
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,519
is actually something that could um that

354
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,160
they might

355
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:58,160
really welcome

356
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:04,239
so quickly what do we actually hope to

357
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,399
get out of this

358
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:08,160
well four things first is putting human

359
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:09,760
rights back at the heart of open source

360
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:12,399
and software development

361
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,439
um the second thing is uh human rights

362
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:15,440
train ip

363
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,959
lawyers and corporations which you know

364
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:19,440
would be a great thing

365
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:21,680
um give a corporations an excuse to

366
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:23,839
reject certain projects

367
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:25,359
and potentially actually reduce the pool

368
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:28,720
of available software

369
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,920
for human rights violation there's been

370
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,079
a lot of critiques

371
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:33,519
of this i'm going to go through five of

372
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:35,199
them really quickly

373
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:36,800
um one of them is there are other better

374
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:39,519
ways of doing this

375
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:41,120
uh i'm sure why don't we try all of

376
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:44,240
these different ways at the same time

377
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:45,920
right doesn't you know can't hurt

378
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,760
the second one is there's a risk of

379
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,000
ethical license proliferation and we see

380
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:51,920
this

381
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:55,120
already right and frankly if we actually

382
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:56,800
built this notion into open source

383
00:13:55,120 --> 00:14:00,560
itself that would actually reduce the

384
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:00,560
risk of proliferation not increase it

385
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:04,000
third and fourth that often come up

386
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,839
together which is kind of

387
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,320
funny is that's gonna be a compliance

388
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:09,199
nightmare or it's not enforceable so not

389
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,440
worth it

390
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:12,479
which is it's one or the other right i

391
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,839
mean it's either going to be a

392
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:17,040
compliance nightmare

393
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:18,800
or it's not and you know and and and

394
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:21,279
as such it would not be enforceable

395
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,479
right um uh or i mean it like it doesn't

396
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:23,120
make sense to have these two things

397
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,360
together

398
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,480
my belief is um from a compliance

399
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,399
perspective

400
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:30,000
um if it's actually channeled to like

401
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:31,360
human rights only and not like a

402
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,760
gazillion other things

403
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,720
um it's actually rather simple and this

404
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,880
could actually help

405
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,399
against proliferation of other issues

406
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,279
you know it's like the slippery slope

407
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:41,839
argument

408
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:42,880
uh well if we do if we allow like human

409
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:45,920
rights what about

410
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:47,120
like you know uh pro-life for bed use

411
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:49,120
was like abortion

412
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,320
and there's a really good answer to this

413
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:53,279
which is

414
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:54,320
um get it into the human rights right if

415
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:56,079
it's if like

416
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,600
you know you know if like it's white

417
00:14:56,079 --> 00:15:00,079
supremacy that you want to

418
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,199
like you know is that your thing well

419
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:02,160
make sure that you get that into human

420
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:04,000
rights and you're going to get by

421
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:06,719
default and every other license

422
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,680
right so it like really scopes uh the

423
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,560
actual

424
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:12,239
sort of like ethical boundary to a body

425
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,518
of law that's really well accepted

426
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:16,240
worldwide

427
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:17,120
um and the last bit is it's a violation

428
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,639
of um

429
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:20,480
the open source definition and the four

430
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:23,600
freedoms i actually think that

431
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:26,079
um um it's

432
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,279
it's possible to do this with was within

433
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:28,079
the balance of the open source

434
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:30,160
definition

435
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:32,239
it would clearly be in violation of the

436
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:35,439
first freedom of the voice

437
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:37,360
of the four freedoms um and

438
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:39,120
um i actually think that that is an

439
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,079
exciting acceptable trade-off and we can

440
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,240
actually change those

441
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:44,399
as a community to reflect the norms that

442
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:48,320
we have today

443
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:48,320
and i think oh two minutes so

444
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:52,639
well next steps this is a huge

445
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:54,800
multi-year effort

446
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:56,320
and like the idea here is to kick start

447
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:59,199
uh this conversation

448
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:00,959
um and to see if this interest um and

449
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:03,519
and then to start discussing well

450
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:05,758
how exactly would we go about this uh is

451
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:07,279
an existing organization like osi

452
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:09,600
ready to take the lead on something like

453
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:10,800
this would this need like a different

454
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,839
organization to step

455
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:15,199
up um basically like is there interest

456
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:17,519
from maintainers

457
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:19,680
uh is there interest from corporations

458
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:20,160
uh let's basically start a conversation

459
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,920
about this

460
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,519
and see if as a community we can move

461
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:26,800
towards um

462
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:29,680
considering um ethics you know

463
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,800
as as a sort of fundamental part of

464
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:33,680
software

465
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:35,040
and uh with this i will uh yield the

466
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:39,599
floor and take questions

467
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:39,599
outside thank you thank you toby

468
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:50,240
thank you toby we really appreciate it
