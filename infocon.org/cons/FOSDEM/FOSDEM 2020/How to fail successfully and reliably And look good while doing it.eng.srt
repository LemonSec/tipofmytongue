1
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:13,360
well thanks everyone for

2
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,678
showing up as i know it's late in the

3
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:18,640
day and you've probably had

4
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:20,640
a lot of conversations and talks and

5
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:23,840
your brain is chock full

6
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,519
of good information so what better way

7
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,920
to end the day than to talk about

8
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:29,759
failure if we're going to talk about

9
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,199
failure and how to fail successfully and

10
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,399
reliably

11
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:36,000
and look good while doing it now we're

12
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:37,440
all here because we care about free and

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,559
open source software that's the name of

14
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:42,160
the conference

15
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:43,519
we are careful and uh compassionate and

16
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:46,480
passionate users of

17
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,960
it many of us are contributors to it all

18
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:51,360
of us

19
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:54,000
are advocates and it's

20
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,760
no coincidence that we are here at the

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,199
free university in brussels

22
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:03,039
now my french pronunciation is awful

23
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:06,798
but i know that libra is not the same as

24
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:09,680
kachui and i appreciate languages where

25
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:11,360
free as in free beer is distinguished

26
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,840
from free as in freedom

27
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:15,040
now free software encompasses both of

28
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,040
those meanings

29
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,400
it is free in the sense that you don't

30
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,400
have to pay for it

31
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:23,119
but i think it's more important that we

32
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:26,640
dwell upon the second meaning of free

33
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:28,960
it is liberating it it allows you to

34
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:32,240
experiment it allows you to

35
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:34,000
fail and it's that notion of freedom

36
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,280
that i want to emphasize that i'm going

37
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,920
to request you

38
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,600
to keep in mind because we know that in

39
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,079
open source software

40
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,640
success and failures are essentially

41
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:48,559
just two directions on the same road

42
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:50,079
we fail as often as we succeed in fact

43
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,159
that's actually an understatement we

44
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:54,399
fail quite a bit more

45
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:55,360
than we succeed and that's par for the

46
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,159
course

47
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,799
it is just another turn in the road

48
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:02,000
there is

49
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:05,280
nothing uh earth shattering

50
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,880
or even that uh odd about failing in

51
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,399
open source software we fail all the

52
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,160
time and

53
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:12,319
of course we are open about it we share

54
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:14,000
about that those failures and we learn

55
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:15,679
from them that's the key thing about the

56
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,840
open source community

57
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:23,040
in that spirit of openness and sharing

58
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,959
uh what i'm gonna ask you to do now will

59
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,679
take a minute or so

60
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:29,920
is to write on those index cards i pass

61
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,640
some index cards out if you didn't get

62
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,640
one

63
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,238
or if you had a set of indus cards in

64
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,518
front of you please just pass them

65
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:37,280
around

66
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:38,879
and what we're gonna do we're gonna take

67
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,840
a minute or so

68
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:43,359
write a failure or two that you've had

69
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,640
in your professional life

70
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,760
on that index card so we'll keep it safe

71
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,518
you're not gonna get into

72
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,840
failures in your personal life although

73
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:52,640
if you if you're feeling particularly

74
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,959
jazzed up

75
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,679
late in the afternoon you may do that as

76
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,159
well

77
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,280
but on those index cards that i provided

78
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:01,519
write a failure

79
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,560
or if you have more than one on that

80
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:05,360
card

81
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:08,400
that um that you encountered yourself it

82
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:19,840
has to be something personal okay

83
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:19,840
so let's take a minute to do that

84
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,680
uh well you might have to share them

85
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:29,360
with your

86
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,200
colleague but we won't publish them in

87
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,799
the conference findings that i can tell

88
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,079
you for sure

89
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:47,840
now of course if you read it out loud it

90
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:47,840
might get recorded and live streamed

91
00:03:57,290 --> 00:04:01,840
[Music]

92
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,840
oh

93
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,840
so

94
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:22,000
[Music]

95
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:23,360
okay well thanks for indulging me

96
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,639
hopefully

97
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:28,160
um some of you had uh something to write

98
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,880
actually let's let's do a quick straw

99
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,720
poll

100
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:33,680
how many people found this exercise a

101
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:36,960
little bit difficult show of hands

102
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:40,080
okay how many people are

103
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:42,400
um thinking about

104
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:44,400
some right or wrong examples of failure

105
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,840
as opposed to something from experience

106
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,599
as in something from the industry

107
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,960
outside of your experience

108
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,880
anybody thinking about that okay that's

109
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,880
good at least people were able to

110
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:55,680
um concentrate on their own experience

111
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:58,159
now thank you for indulging me again but

112
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,040
you wouldn't be off if you were to kind

113
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,120
of accuse me

114
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,560
of being a little bit presumptuous in

115
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,479
asking you to do that because i asked

116
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,639
you to do an exercise

117
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:08,639
without first taking this as a

118
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:10,240
scientific obviously conference

119
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:12,240
taking the liberty to define what

120
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,039
failure is so obviously how would you

121
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,320
even

122
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:16,240
we have to come to terms right how would

123
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,680
you even define or write an example if

124
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,320
you haven't yet decided

125
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,440
what failure is so um the dictionary

126
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,520
definition

127
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,960
uh from the oxford dictionary of failure

128
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:27,039
is this

129
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,239
uh two or three definitions now i don't

130
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:29,440
like the first one is circular

131
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,120
definition

132
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,880
failures lack of success i guess success

133
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,360
is like a failure doesn't really get as

134
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,800
much

135
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,199
i like the second and the third one

136
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,240
better the omission of an expected

137
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:40,880
result

138
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:44,080
or required action and lack or

139
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:45,759
deficiency of a desirable quality

140
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,840
those seem plausible we can work with

141
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:49,680
them so allow me to use those two

142
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,919
definitions from the oxford dictionary

143
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,600
and

144
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:56,479
add a another phrase

145
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:58,479
one of a decisive action and offer this

146
00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:01,280
working definition for the con

147
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:03,520
for the con purpose of this conversation

148
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,638
a lack or deficiency of a desirable

149
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:07,840
quality

150
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:09,360
caused by a decisive action

151
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,119
let's use that you don't have to agree

152
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,400
with this definition 100

153
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,160
but let's use this for the remainder of

154
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,799
the hour to see where we can go with

155
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,880
that so

156
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,240
let's say there is some quality some

157
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,479
measurable quality

158
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,000
uh no scales on the horizontal vertical

159
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:23,359
axis because you want to leave this as

160
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,520
general as possible

161
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,039
and let's say it's trending mostly in a

162
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,039
positive direction over time

163
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:31,120
something you find valuable and you have

164
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:34,080
to make a decision and that's the key

165
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,800
if it trends by itself up and down then

166
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,359
really i mean

167
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,639
you could pass or fail at somebody

168
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:41,680
else's whims or

169
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:43,199
i guess based on the vagaries of quantum

170
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,319
mechanics but really you can't do

171
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,520
anything about it so we're only

172
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:46,400
interested in things that you can

173
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,318
control

174
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,799
over which you have some agency so let's

175
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:52,960
say you make a decision at some point

176
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:55,440
and as a result of that decision well

177
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:57,520
one of several things can happen

178
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:59,199
that thing that you value it's that

179
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:02,400
quality that you appreciate

180
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:04,240
it can go trending up more or less along

181
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,638
the same path that it was going to go

182
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,000
presumably or it can trend down right

183
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:10,160
those are essentially the

184
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
three possibilities in general and it's

185
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,120
the possibility when it trends down gets

186
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,319
into it especially when it gets to the

187
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,639
negative territory

188
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:17,440
as in the value reduces below some

189
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:20,319
predetermined

190
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:21,360
zero or break-even point that you would

191
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:23,039
call a failure

192
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,840
so failure is essentially something that

193
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:27,440
you value going into negative territory

194
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,119
based on the outcome of a decision you

195
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:31,120
make so that's

196
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,880
what we mean in a almost like a

197
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,720
graphical representation

198
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:37,520
of this working definition now let's

199
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:39,599
tease this definition apart a little bit

200
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:41,359
to its different components so let's

201
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:44,000
start with the one that frankly i

202
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,599
somewhat gratuitously added to the end a

203
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,360
decisive action

204
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:48,960
now the first thing you might say

205
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,800
especially since it's the part that i

206
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,560
added is well duh

207
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,319
don't make stupid decisions you won't

208
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:57,520
fail right i mean

209
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:58,960
decide better in advance that's

210
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,639
plausible although

211
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,878
some might say probably a naive

212
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:03,919
statement because you often will sell

213
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:05,280
them do you know the

214
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:07,280
complete outcome of the decisions you

215
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:09,440
make but let's say you know that

216
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,638
you know some outcomes or you ought to

217
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:14,240
be able to know

218
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:15,520
here's the deal so this is i don't know

219
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,520
what you all were doing

220
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:19,120
almost three years ago on february 28

221
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:21,758
2017

222
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:23,280
um but and actually i don't know if the

223
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,560
frankfurt region or regions here in the

224
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:27,280
us were affected

225
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,400
i know what i was doing on that day i

226
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:31,520
was dealing

227
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:34,640
with this outage on us

228
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,199
one region which is region one by the

229
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,958
way

230
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,039
uh the primacy i mean you'll come in

231
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:41,598
first you'll get named region one

232
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:42,319
in aws parliaments that was down like

233
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:46,880
out

234
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:50,080
as in dead and it was so dead

235
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:52,160
that amazon's health page suffered

236
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,440
so if you went to aws's health page it

237
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:55,279
was all green

238
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,279
because that was a cached copy of when

239
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:58,480
it was green so of course the first hour

240
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:00,560
or so we spent

241
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:02,080
trusting aws his health page and looking

242
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,839
far and wide

243
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,680
into our own software where it was

244
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:06,959
failing and only then

245
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,640
while we're at work we don't usually

246
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:10,239
check twitter that much but only then

247
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,240
did we caught up to the

248
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,680
entire maelstrom that was having

249
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,800
happening on twitter

250
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:17,120
twitter of course uh indicatively does

251
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,760
not

252
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:21,200
tie itself to the us east one region so

253
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,600
we were able to catch up

254
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:25,200
so the point that i'm making here is you

255
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,959
can only take this notion of well i will

256
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,000
not make stupid decisions and fail so

257
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:30,079
far

258
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,680
i will venture to say of course aws is

259
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,440
not really open source

260
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:35,760
in the sense that we value here but

261
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:38,320
they're pretty big and if they can fail

262
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:39,519
we should be humble and say we will too

263
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,519
if you don't make a mistake

264
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:42,959
some somebody in your team will somebody

265
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:44,800
that you depend on will

266
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:47,119
case in point and failures will happen

267
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,640
so failures are a fact of life you can't

268
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,480
simply say well i will avoid them

269
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:52,240
it's not a workable strategy so then the

270
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,839
thing to talk about is these two terms

271
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,040
from systems engineering mean time

272
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:57,279
between failure

273
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,719
and mean time to recovery if you accept

274
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:59,120
the notion that failures are a fact of

275
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,279
life

276
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,560
then the thing we have to talk about is

277
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:04,160
what are we going to do when we fail so

278
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,640
the ideal system is the one that never

279
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,079
fails

280
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,680
there's no such system you'll accept

281
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:09,599
that but it's only up there

282
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:11,760
as a point of reference so given that

283
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,200
that's an ideal it will not happen

284
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:15,600
there's one kind of system you can

285
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,360
imagine that doesn't fail very often

286
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,640
but when it does it takes a long time to

287
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:23,120
bring back up

288
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:24,800
so it has a low mean time to recovery

289
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,399
sorry high mean time to recovery but

290
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,439
also high meantime between failure

291
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:29,440
doesn't fail often

292
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:31,519
but takes a long time to bring back up

293
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,079
another thing that you can contrast that

294
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:33,600
with

295
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:35,359
is a system that is low on both those

296
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,920
categories it fails often

297
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,440
does go down but it also takes really a

298
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,519
snap of your fingers

299
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,959
metaphorically speaking to bring back up

300
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:45,120
again so

301
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:46,640
obviously given that if you could flip a

302
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,720
coin or make a wish you would choose the

303
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:51,920
ideal but that's not reality

304
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,560
which one would you rather have any

305
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,560
takers

306
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:56,000
who would vote for the system that has

307
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:58,839
the second one high mean time to

308
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,480
recovery and high mean time between

309
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:04,160
failure

310
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:06,720
one sorry depends on your use case

311
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,719
exactly

312
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:10,320
why not exactly it depends on the use

313
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,399
case there's no absolute answers

314
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,600
but assuming that you could tolerate

315
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:15,760
failure

316
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,680
would you rather have a failure that is

317
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,399
of that type or any takers for the low

318
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:21,920
mttr

319
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:24,240
and low mtbf

320
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:25,680
a couple more hands and obviously you're

321
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,120
absolutely spot on the use case

322
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,079
determines if you can live for an hour

323
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,440
long failure

324
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:30,959
but the failure happens very

325
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,519
infrequently maybe that's the right use

326
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:34,640
case

327
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:36,640
and that context is very v is very um

328
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,399
important however there's some human

329
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,519
aspects to this that we should be aware

330
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:41,360
of

331
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:42,959
and this is a system where failure is

332
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:46,079
easy to recover from

333
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:47,599
favors experimentation and improvement

334
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:49,040
so the use case you're talking about

335
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,720
very rightly you can call it the

336
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,160
production behavior right i mean

337
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,160
what would you do in production but

338
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,880
think about it as as developers or

339
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,560
people

340
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,320
in the technology sector how do you

341
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,040
approach a system that exhibits that

342
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,000
behavior

343
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:03,439
a system that has a high time to recover

344
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,160
you approach it gingerly

345
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:07,519
with trepidation with some fear that hey

346
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,959
if i bring it down

347
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:11,279
it's going to take me hours to bring it

348
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:13,040
back up versus a system where failure is

349
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:15,040
difficult to recover calm

350
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:16,880
causes a culture of change minimization

351
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:19,199
you don't approach that at all

352
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:20,079
so you just say i'm not gonna touch it

353
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,920
this is where

354
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:23,439
your change request boards and all of

355
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:26,719
that bureaucracy comes in

356
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:28,320
because everybody's scared of failure so

357
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,160
knowing this distinction and you can

358
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,519
just look at your own psyche or look at

359
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,639
how your team or your friends in

360
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:34,880
technology or even

361
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:36,079
actually outside of technology behave

362
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,279
the people who say if it ain't broke

363
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:38,399
don't fix it

364
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:40,480
those are the people who know when it

365
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:41,920
goes broke it's a pain in the neck to

366
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,519
bring back up the people who know i can

367
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,959
fix this failure they won't usually say

368
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:46,480
if it ain't broke don't fix it because

369
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:48,880
they will say how can i improve

370
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:50,399
so it's human nature and this brings us

371
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,839
to our first ethic that if you don't

372
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:53,200
think you can trip or nobody's gonna

373
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:55,519
trip your friends are gonna trip your

374
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:58,000
teammates are gonna trip we all trip

375
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:59,600
and what we want to learn from that is

376
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,440
how we react to tripping

377
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,880
and error recovery is greater than error

378
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,720
prevention

379
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,160
it's kind of in the agile manifesto both

380
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,160
sides are are great

381
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,360
but we favor the left side over the

382
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,800
right side it's not like

383
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,399
error prevention isn't an awesome thing

384
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,359
we should just fail wantonly that's not

385
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:15,519
the implication

386
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,480
but given a choice we weigh error

387
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:18,079
recovery

388
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:20,240
over air prevention prevention we should

389
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:22,319
invest time in recovering from errors

390
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:24,639
perhaps more more so than preventing

391
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,639
errors

392
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:31,920
okay this

393
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:32,240
is a bike shed um not a very impressive

394
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,599
one

395
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:36,959
how many people think they can improve

396
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:39,040
this i have no idea of your knowledge of

397
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:40,719
building things but few hands are up

398
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,880
there a few more hands right i mean it's

399
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,000
not great i didn't make it but it's

400
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,199
rusty i don't even know how it's

401
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,880
standing up

402
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:48,160
clearly water has caused damage so

403
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,839
whatever you store inside including

404
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:52,719
bikes are going to be exposed to weather

405
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:54,000
so we can all see uh ways to improve it

406
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,920
right

407
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,120
so i can too so you're with me those who

408
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:00,319
raised your hands

409
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:03,120
now here's an analogy this is

410
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,839
the man page for sleep uh how many

411
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,240
people would

412
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:07,920
like this sleep function which basically

413
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,519
puts your current thread to sleep

414
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,040
how many people would like it to work so

415
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:13,680
that you could put it to sleep between

416
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:16,399
any value between let's say milliseconds

417
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:17,599
microseconds seconds hours is that a

418
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:20,320
reasonable behavior

419
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:22,560
people who think that's reasonable okay

420
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:25,519
well sorry to disappoint you

421
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:27,599
the linux sleep function takes an

422
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:29,360
argument which is number of seconds

423
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,720
so even though your faster clock cycles

424
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,720
and whatnot

425
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,720
using this style you cannot make it

426
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:36,000
sleep less than a second

427
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,240
how many people think they can improve

428
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,320
on that honest let's be honest

429
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,360
in today's with today's computers of

430
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,959
course you can

431
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,480
and you would not be surprised this is

432
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:45,680
more than an email from more than 20

433
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,920
years ago so linux

434
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:49,839
obviously borrows from the bsd behavior

435
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:51,120
this is an email from 1999 so more than

436
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:54,560
20 years ago

437
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:57,440
and in it there is

438
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:58,079
this notion that bike setting is

439
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,720
described

440
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:02,560
everybody had an opinion on sleep one

441
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,920
because it was easy to conceive of a

442
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,800
sleep behavior where you could put it to

443
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:07,279
sleep for less than

444
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,560
a fraction of a second and this

445
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:09,600
description is where the term bike

446
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:12,160
shedding comes from

447
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,279
and the term is given a choice this

448
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:15,199
actually happens

449
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:17,600
given a choice between asking for

450
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:20,240
improvements to a nuclear reactor

451
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:22,079
versus a bike shed more people have

452
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,680
opinions on how to improve a bike shed

453
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:25,120
than the nuclear reactor

454
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:27,040
now you don't have to be a nuclear

455
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,839
scientist or any kind of scientist to

456
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,599
know that

457
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:31,440
mistakes making or failures in making a

458
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,839
nuclear reactor kind of have a bigger

459
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,440
impact than fixing a bike shed yet the

460
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:37,440
converse is true for human

461
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,880
psychology we tend to have more opinions

462
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,000
about things we can all conceive that

463
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,600
can be improved like

464
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,040
sleep one we can all very easily

465
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:45,199
conceive how to improve it

466
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:46,560
but who will go ahead and do all the

467
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:49,279
things we heard in the mornings keynote

468
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:50,638
about the real hard problems of linux

469
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:52,880
probably very few of us that would be a

470
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:54,800
fair statement and that

471
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:56,320
notion we have to remember that is part

472
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,839
of how we react to

473
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:00,000
complexity we actually react to

474
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:01,680
complexity by stepping back but whereas

475
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,199
over simplicity we like to step in and

476
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:05,199
have opinions this

477
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:06,319
brings us to the second thing when we

478
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:07,040
talk about decisions that lead to

479
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,720
failure

480
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,079
if a decision is merely an opinion

481
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,160
trying to find a voice

482
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:14,479
curb it knowing the difference between a

483
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:17,279
bike shed and a nuclear reactor

484
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:18,639
is key to dealing with failure it

485
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:20,240
doesn't matter if you fail to make a

486
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:20,720
bike if it's a leaky one like we

487
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,560
saw

488
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,240
it doesn't really matter the world has

489
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,758
moved on if sleep still

490
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,199
can't take a fraction of a second that's

491
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:28,399
not the biggest problem confronting us

492
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:30,079
we have bigger problems

493
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:31,519
and the ability to recognize where to

494
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:32,638
cause improvement and where not

495
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:35,600
is the key thing to learning from

496
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:37,600
failure okay

497
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,880
so let's go back to the definition and

498
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:41,360
let's look at a different part of the

499
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:42,959
definition the lack or the deficiency

500
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,639
that's the part that came directly from

501
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:47,518
the dictionary so

502
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:47,519
how uh

503
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,720
do the everybody feel about some of

504
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:54,719
these things right so it's a pretty

505
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,839
savvy community so show of hands i'm

506
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,959
gonna run through some things just throw

507
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:57,839
your hand if you approve if you agree

508
00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:01,199
with that statement

509
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:02,800
we favor smaller commits

510
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:06,240
i'm everybody should be raising their

511
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:08,319
hand really uh more frequent feedback

512
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,520
easy one these are easy gimmies right

513
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:11,039
fewer manual tests

514
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,799
might be some opinion there okay that's

515
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:14,480
good to see which implies more

516
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:15,918
doesn't mean fewer testing it means more

517
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:19,199
automation

518
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:20,799
more time for refactoring really you all

519
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:22,240
must be doing a lot of refactoring if

520
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:24,240
only like five hands went down

521
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:26,480
okay these are all easy ones maybe not

522
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:28,240
the third one but everybody more or less

523
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:30,480
in general agrees but here's the

524
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:32,160
question how would you know when more or

525
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:34,960
less or fewer means

526
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:36,240
unless you actually measure it so

527
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,760
measurement is key

528
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,440
sometimes we make decisions and we

529
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:41,520
question the value of the decisions

530
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,799
but we have no data to back anything up

531
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,840
it's based all on gut feel and

532
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:48,080
heuristics that's not scientific at all

533
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:49,678
so for example in the project that i'm

534
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:52,240
on or actually i

535
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:53,200
was on until december branching strategy

536
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:55,200
was a key thing

537
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:57,200
uh there's different opinions on it some

538
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:59,440
people many people are very

539
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,799
vehement opponents or proponents of

540
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,080
trunk-based commits and many people like

541
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:03,440
feature branches then of course you get

542
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,879
into the length of feature branches

543
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,600
short-lived long-lived et cetera et

544
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,080
cetera

545
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:09,840
we decided to document it for our team

546
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,280
and we did something that made sense

547
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:13,199
now of course i'm not advocating

548
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:15,760
confluence or geo any tool

549
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:17,440
certainly not a closed uh source tool

550
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:19,200
that's what we use on that project

551
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,640
you can use an active decision record

552
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,919
template that's based on michael

553
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:24,240
newguard's work

554
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:25,280
this is openly available on github

555
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,120
actually i would

556
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:28,559
given all all things being equal i would

557
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,159
favor this because i can keep this very

558
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:32,000
close to my source code it's in source i

559
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:35,280
can commit it my decisions can

560
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:37,679
stay versioned together with

561
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,720
my source code so it doesn't matter

562
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:42,880
which tool you use

563
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:45,600
but documenting decisions is key and why

564
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:47,919
it is because software and the decisions

565
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:50,159
around software like everything we do

566
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:51,760
in life essentially involve a lot of

567
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,679
storytelling

568
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,799
there's a lot of narrative there's a lot

569
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:57,520
of history

570
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:59,440
there's context and it's not a

571
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:00,639
commentary on software by no means open

572
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,080
source software which by the way is a

573
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,600
lot better than closed source software

574
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:06,399
because of all the eyeballs

575
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:07,918
but if you read a line of code anybody

576
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:11,360
who can read code can figure out

577
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:12,000
what it does very seldom can you figure

578
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:15,520
out

579
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:17,440
why it does that that why because it's

580
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:19,039
an exclusion thing right why does it do

581
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:20,720
that as opposed to the 10 other things i

582
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:21,679
can imagine well those 10 things aren't

583
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,440
listed hopefully

584
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:25,360
and commented out actually that would be

585
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,559
bad code it might be in the version

586
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:28,479
history if you go back

587
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:31,039
but you might have a novel idea you will

588
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:33,039
never to simply reading code figure out

589
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:34,400
why does it work this way not that way

590
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:36,080
that i can think of

591
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,600
that isn't a campfire story in

592
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:39,520
somebody's head

593
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:41,039
and if we don't tell and share those

594
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:43,039
stories that will

595
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:44,960
never get transmitted from person to

596
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:47,280
person that actually is very key

597
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,720
that's why all of the open source the

598
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,000
one thing community's favorite

599
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,799
documentation the one thing we learn in

600
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,640
the queue note is

601
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:54,080
there are too many mailing lists i was

602
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,120
actually clapping when that was said

603
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,320
because i'm like

604
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,918
i've been on the other side in close

605
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,720
source software where there is no way to

606
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:00,160
find out

607
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,919
if there's too much information my

608
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,960
problem might be i have conflicting data

609
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:04,799
which one do i get

610
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,159
it will never be i don't know why it

611
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:08,240
works this way and there's nothing

612
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:09,679
documented and there are no tests and i

613
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,520
just lost and there's no person i can

614
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:13,600
find now what do i do i'm going to see

615
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:17,200
it inside but i will never have

616
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:18,158
this notion of how not to make mistakes

617
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,320
or how not to fail

618
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:21,919
so for failure recovery you have to

619
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,520
measure and document

620
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:25,120
the impact of your decisions first if

621
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:27,120
it's just a heuristic if it's just a

622
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:28,879
wishful thinking just a gut feeling

623
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:31,199
it's really not scientific it's not even

624
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:33,120
going to survive the test of time

625
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,640
and if you're wondering why measurement

626
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:36,000
is that important and i keep dwelling on

627
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,360
it and you might be thinking well how do

628
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,559
you measure developer happiness how do

629
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:41,360
you measure those things

630
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:42,399
you can and i encourage you to here's a

631
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:44,080
book

632
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:46,000
from douglas hubbard he talks about how

633
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:48,158
to measure anything

634
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,080
and he takes a hard thing how to measure

635
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:52,320
the value of human life

636
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:53,360
tough problem uh you may think well

637
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,120
that's

638
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:56,799
a kind of forboden that's forbidden you

639
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:58,320
shouldn't measure all lives are valuable

640
00:20:56,799 --> 00:21:00,000
well then you have a triage situation

641
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:02,158
situation in a military hospital

642
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,600
they do assign a numerical value to

643
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:05,440
human life they divide

644
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:07,600
the injured in three categories people

645
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:09,760
who will survive no matter

646
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:11,678
what if they get care or not people who

647
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:13,440
will die no matter whatever care you

648
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:15,360
provide and a third category

649
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,960
people who will survive if you provide

650
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:18,799
them care but die otherwise

651
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,640
and it's that third category the the

652
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:21,679
field hospitals the field medics address

653
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,200
first

654
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:24,960
what is that if not an actual value

655
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,559
proposition on human life so he starts

656
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,080
with that example and many others

657
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:30,639
so this notion of well i can't measure

658
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:32,639
happiness and i can your satisfaction

659
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:34,320
i call nonsense on that try to it might

660
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,760
be hard but please do it

661
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:38,158
that is what makes your decisions

662
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:40,080
traceable and the value they provide

663
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:41,520
actually compelling as opposed to an

664
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:45,199
opinion

665
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:48,158
okay so let's go to the

666
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:51,440
last bit about uh of the definition

667
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:53,919
which is the notion of causality

668
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:55,520
so causality is important so let's say

669
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:58,000
you're building a website

670
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,960
and uh like a very silly example let's

671
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,360
say you have

672
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:02,559
two different kinds of look and feel one

673
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:04,719
is blue and one is green

674
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:05,600
and from some reason you find out that

675
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:08,320
the green one

676
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:09,840
elicits uh more people more users to

677
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:12,000
click on it right so you have

678
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:13,678
72 percent click rate versus 52 percent

679
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,400
click rate when you change the user

680
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:16,559
interface

681
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,600
well knowing that you still don't know

682
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:19,760
the causality

683
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,639
but at least knowing that correlation

684
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:22,320
helps you

685
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,159
in the last talk we heard from mukash

686
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:25,600
this talk about correlation of testing

687
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:27,280
the brilliant idea and

688
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:29,280
i really want to encourage you to look

689
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:30,559
at his work because correlation is the

690
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,918
first step

691
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:33,918
towards causation doesn't prove

692
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:35,440
correlation but uh

693
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:37,280
doesn't prove causation but at least

694
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:40,960
hints at it so

695
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:43,678
you every test that you write is a test

696
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:44,720
towards determining at least correlation

697
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:47,120
if not causation

698
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:48,240
so here's a user interface test from one

699
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:51,360
of the projects

700
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:52,799
that i worked on and if you

701
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,918
don't like javascript then don't read

702
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:54,480
anything other than the highlighted

703
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:56,400
stuff

704
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,520
basically it's talking about when i

705
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,760
click on the left button

706
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:02,158
then i expect that particular path to be

707
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:02,158
emitted

708
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:08,400
which is the graphical equivalent

709
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:11,440
of essentially saying when i when the

710
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:14,400
user clicks on this button

711
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:16,559
then they will be taken to this url now

712
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:18,480
if that's the behavior i want

713
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:20,080
then i can test it i can actually test

714
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,600
it in a provable style

715
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:24,000
and therefore form the correlation

716
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:26,080
between action a happened

717
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,120
result b was observed or if it's not

718
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,840
observed then the test will fail

719
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:30,000
obviously

720
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:31,600
now you can do better than that you

721
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,400
don't actually have to have

722
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:35,840
tests these tests probably will run

723
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,480
before you put your software in

724
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:38,000
production

725
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:40,000
you can run testing in production it's a

726
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,360
thing but here's how you do really

727
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,640
testing in production so my former

728
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:45,600
colleague dan abel

729
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:46,480
uh in his company they have a website

730
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:49,039
which has

731
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:50,960
or a mobile or i don't know exactly

732
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:53,919
mobile app or a

733
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:55,120
performant website responsive website

734
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:56,640
which has a fallback

735
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:58,239
and the fallback is the login screen

736
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:00,960
defaults to an old style

737
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:02,640
uh kind of html 1.0 screen when the

738
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:04,000
primary one fails and then they track

739
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:06,080
how many users are using that

740
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,159
old screen and they have an alert on

741
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,799
that so in this particular instance when

742
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:10,559
50

743
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:12,240
or more of the people are logging in

744
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:14,639
using the older style

745
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:16,159
web page they know and they can go and

746
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:17,120
fix it this actually happened this is

747
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:19,440
from his blog

748
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:20,959
so i encourage you to read it this

749
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:22,400
happened and they were able to track

750
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,080
their failure their their

751
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,840
kind of actual production failure before

752
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,639
users complain because users probably

753
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,799
noted as

754
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:30,640
this login page looks funny funnier than

755
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:32,080
the last time but i can still log in

756
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:33,520
but they knew something was wrong with

757
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:36,000
their system because too many people

758
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:39,760
were being redirected to the old page

759
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:42,640
that's how you make your causality

760
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:43,520
apparent the cause of the failure is

761
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:45,840
that the

762
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:46,559
the indicator is 52 people using the old

763
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:48,000
style

764
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:49,360
the cause might be well the new style

765
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,440
that page the modern web page doesn't

766
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:53,039
work or the app is down

767
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,559
so i would encourage you to look at that

768
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:55,440
but this is awesome this is the high

769
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:58,240
value stuff

770
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,799
to determine causality that you want to

771
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,720
look at

772
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:02,639
now a word about causality those amongst

773
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:04,400
you who are math aficionados which

774
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:06,960
should be all of you really

775
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:08,559
um know that correlation and causation

776
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:10,799
are not the same thing

777
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:12,480
however correlation is a superset of

778
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:14,240
causation

779
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,679
and it means that if there's no

780
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,360
correlation

781
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:18,880
there cannot be causation but the

782
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:20,158
reverse is not true

783
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:22,080
so if you can't establish any

784
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:23,440
correlation between two things

785
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,960
if the coefficient is zero in

786
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:26,240
mathematical parlance and of course

787
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,679
there's no causation

788
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:29,679
but the correlation could be one or

789
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:33,600
close to one and it might still be

790
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:35,120
happenstance or pure um conjecture or

791
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:37,199
through things that co-vary based on

792
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:39,678
some third and yet unknown parameter

793
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,880
cause but here's the thing to find out

794
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:42,640
if you can determine if you can

795
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:44,000
determine exclusivity from correlation

796
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:45,120
outside this outer circle

797
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,120
then clearly you're outside the

798
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,678
causation circle as well so if you

799
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,439
change the

800
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:51,200
in simple parlance if you change the

801
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:54,159
color of your website from

802
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:55,919
green to blue and no changes observe 50

803
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:58,960
people were clicking before 50

804
00:25:55,919 --> 00:26:00,240
off now no correlation therefore no

805
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:02,240
causation as well

806
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:03,919
outside the outer circle by definition

807
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:06,080
outside the inner circle as well

808
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:08,159
causation is hard to pin in real life

809
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:10,320
because there's always so many factors

810
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:12,400
you especially in live testing you can

811
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:14,399
never have the laboratory that you

812
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:16,159
change even one variable even in a b

813
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,679
testing it's really hard because you

814
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:18,799
never know the extra factors that you

815
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:20,640
weren't measuring

816
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:22,720
but if you have excluded correlation

817
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:24,799
correlation you have excluded causation

818
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:26,400
and this brings me to my fourth edit at

819
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:28,240
minimum established correlation to

820
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:30,240
understand the impact of decisions

821
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:31,279
you may not be able to do causation as i

822
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,960
said in real world

823
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:35,360
too many moving parts too much

824
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:36,880
complexity but you should be able to

825
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:38,479
establish correlation

826
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:40,080
vary one thing and see what it happens

827
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:41,360
it may or may not have caused it

828
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:43,678
but at least you would be better off

829
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:45,439
than measuring nothing

830
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:47,120
and of course the dilemma to this is

831
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:50,240
skip the inconsequential decisions don't

832
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:54,239
do this for things that are trivial

833
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:54,240
okay so now i want to take

834
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:59,279
a turn i'll talk about the virtue of

835
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,279
sloth

836
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:06,399
okay so this is a very famous quote

837
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:11,760
from donald knuth's

838
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:12,960
book i mean if you don't know the whole

839
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:16,400
of it i'm sure

840
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:19,120
everybody has read this part

841
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:21,039
right premature optimization is the root

842
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:24,158
of our label there's a whole context

843
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:24,720
what people do not know is literally the

844
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:28,240
next

845
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:30,240
sentence in that book which is we should

846
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:32,240
not pass up opportunities in that

847
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:33,760
critical three percent

848
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:36,960
a good programmer will not be lulled

849
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:40,559
into complacency by such reasoning

850
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:42,720
pardon the old use of genders

851
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:44,080
he will use the wise to look he will be

852
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,919
wise to you look carefully at the

853
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:47,760
critical code but only after that code

854
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:50,080
has been identified

855
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:51,440
so 97 of the time it may not matter but

856
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:54,879
that three percent is

857
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:58,000
very critical and that brings

858
00:27:54,880 --> 00:28:00,080
me to the next ethic

859
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:02,640
you want to defer decisions until the

860
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:04,960
last responsible moment

861
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:06,559
but you want to know when that is so

862
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:08,320
here's an example which some of you

863
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:10,559
might be grappling with

864
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:12,639
um should you upgrade your jdk from

865
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:14,320
version 8 to a more recent version

866
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:16,320
that's very pressing it's been a very

867
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:18,399
pressing problem for years now right

868
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:19,439
well i mean i know 11 and 12 are now out

869
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:22,320
but people still

870
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:23,200
have 12 so you can make some scientific

871
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,879
information

872
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,320
scientific basis for that right so this

873
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:29,760
is from oracle's

874
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:30,960
website uh the end of life for

875
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:33,360
it's coming end of the year so now it's

876
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:35,600
literally counting down by months

877
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:37,360
10 months or 11 months and counting

878
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:40,320
maybe 10 months

879
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:42,000
and we can see that there's no plans for

880
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:43,200
deprecated on the desktops you might say

881
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,640
well okay well i've got maybe i've got a

882
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,080
little bit more time well then what

883
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,440
about the security

884
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:50,240
implications so you can go to for

885
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:51,600
example the cve details for jdk and you

886
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,720
see well there's a lot of bugs on the

887
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:54,879
jdk

888
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:56,320
and then some of them are high severity

889
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:59,520
but then you can see

890
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:01,439
the some of these are for other versions

891
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:03,279
of the jdk as well they're low priority

892
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:04,559
and they're also present in jdk 11 12

893
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:07,200
and 13 so you like

894
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:08,080
updating it to 11 or 12 may not solve

895
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,919
this problem

896
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:11,439
but then there are others on the bottom

897
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:14,159
that are only

898
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:16,320
for uh that particular older version of

899
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:17,760
the jdk jdk8 so obviously a lot of

900
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,720
information there you might say even a

901
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:20,158
fuzzy

902
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,760
thing like when you're making a decision

903
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:24,159
matrix should i and shouldn't i

904
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:26,080
when now later well december or maybe

905
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:28,080
later than december or before

906
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:29,439
it's a it's still going to be a somewhat

907
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,879
subjective decision but there are these

908
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:32,240
data points you can use right it doesn't

909
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:33,360
have to be literally c to the parents

910
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:36,399
kind of line

911
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:39,678
so this is what it might look like if

912
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:41,039
you're deriving some value out of it

913
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:42,720
is going up and at some point it's going

914
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:43,679
to go down and it's going to go in the

915
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:46,559
negative

916
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:48,960
and the decision and where do you do it

917
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:50,240
will have an impact so if you decide to

918
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:52,080
make that decision here whether that's

919
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:53,760
to change adk or whatever this might

920
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:55,039
have this curve it might have an initial

921
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:57,679
downward curve

922
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:58,799
and then it might go up if you do it a

923
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:00,880
little bit later

924
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:02,399
well you'll drive a few more a little

925
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:04,159
bit more benefit from the upward curve

926
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:05,760
but then it will cost you more

927
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:07,360
and if you do it really late well then

928
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,320
you're very close to the actual value

929
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,840
going negative

930
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:11,520
so you might have had all that time to

931
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:13,678
decide you might have used that time

932
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:15,520
but you'll be very close to zero or

933
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:16,000
potentially negative value even after

934
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:18,080
enacting

935
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,760
your decision that variation on when to

936
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:22,799
make time will have impact

937
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:26,320
on what transpires and that

938
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:27,840
is the essentially the ethic of

939
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:30,639
deferred decisions until the last

940
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:34,879
responsible moment

941
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:36,480
but it comes with a lemma no later

942
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:38,080
and how do you know well if you're that

943
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:39,520
close to the iceberg there's really no

944
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,240
point in turning the steering wheel then

945
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:42,720
really you might

946
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:43,279
want to hit it head on and not scrape it

947
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,880
and that's

948
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:46,240
there's a scientific word for that a

949
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:47,600
scientific notion which is one of

950
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:51,440
satisficing

951
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:54,080
it's a too it's a combined word from

952
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:56,240
satisfying and sufficing and you put it

953
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:57,918
together to satisfy so it comes from a

954
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:59,200
paper by herbert simon for which he

955
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:00,880
actually won the nobel prize in

956
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:02,399
economics i believe uh

957
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:04,880
several years ago several decades ago in

958
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:07,600
fact so there's a long paper which

959
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:08,799
uh there's a link for that in the

960
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:10,559
conference slides which i think will be

961
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:11,840
made available later but here's the code

962
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:13,519
that

963
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:16,158
matters that's the money code as they

964
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:18,559
say decision makers can satisfy

965
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:19,679
satisfies either by finding optimum

966
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:23,120
solutions

967
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:25,200
for a simplified world or by finding

968
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:26,879
satisfactory solutions for a more

969
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:28,399
realistic world

970
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:29,679
neither approach in general dominates

971
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:30,719
the other and both have continued to

972
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:32,960
co-exist

973
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:34,320
so you can defer and make your model

974
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:36,640
more realistic

975
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:37,678
and find a more ideal solution for that

976
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:40,880
or you can

977
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:44,399
simplify your world replace horses with

978
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:46,880
circles as a joke goes and make a more

979
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:47,518
earlier decision and neither approach is

980
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:49,120
perfect

981
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:51,760
and certainly neither approach dominates

982
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:54,959
the other either

983
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:59,120
and that is the key to determining

984
00:31:54,960 --> 00:32:01,200
what to do now bringing to a close

985
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:02,320
the decisions that we make the failures

986
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:04,559
that even that we make

987
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:05,439
they're really a fork in the road

988
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:08,240
there's no

989
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:09,440
perfect versus imperfect perfect as not

990
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,960
not just the enemy of the good

991
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:12,720
but it's actually the enemy of progress

992
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:14,399
especially in open source land because

993
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:15,279
we are compelled to make decisions that

994
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:16,959
every minute and

995
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:18,880
collective decisions at every minute of

996
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:22,080
our lives and uh

997
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:25,519
we're not alone in it

998
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:28,639
financial statements become with that

999
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:30,880
caveat as well that past behavior is no

1000
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:34,080
indicator of future success or failure

1001
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:35,440
if you search for any of your financial

1002
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:36,158
statements there's fine print on the

1003
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:38,960
bottom

1004
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:40,480
all the stock market stocks say that

1005
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:42,159
everything says that that past

1006
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:44,080
behavior is no predictor of future

1007
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:47,440
performance and that brings

1008
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:49,360
us to perhaps the most important ethic

1009
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:51,519
which is when you're making a decision

1010
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:53,120
based on what you know

1011
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:55,519
and looking at one of these paths that

1012
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:57,279
that might that decision might take

1013
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:59,200
what you really don't know at that point

1014
00:32:57,279 --> 00:33:01,440
is how it would have turned out

1015
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:03,039
had you just you know lisa's fair style

1016
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,559
let things roll

1017
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:06,720
that obviously only comes with the

1018
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:07,360
benefit of hindsight and nobody has 20

1019
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:09,919
20.

1020
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:10,959
four side everybody has 20 20 hindsight

1021
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:12,960
so at the point where you're making a

1022
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:13,760
decision you have no idea what's going

1023
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,440
to happen

1024
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:16,960
you make a decision and you measure the

1025
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,919
impact of that decision of course that's

1026
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:20,000
what you do

1027
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:21,840
but here's a mistake that we make

1028
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,600
because we are human

1029
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:25,039
we have that what if thinking what if i

1030
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:26,480
had made a different decision or made

1031
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:28,720
not made a decision

1032
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:30,640
so beware of comparing real costs with

1033
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:32,240
imaginary benefits

1034
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:33,519
after the fact when you make a decision

1035
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:35,200
especially if it doesn't turn out the

1036
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:37,440
way you want it or the way you wished

1037
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:39,279
you say ah that decision was the culprit

1038
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:40,559
if i just either hadn't made it or made

1039
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:40,960
a different decision i wouldn't be where

1040
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:43,360
i

1041
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:45,120
was right now you can't do that because

1042
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:46,479
you know the reality of this real world

1043
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,678
but you don't know the reality of the

1044
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:50,880
alternate world right

1045
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:54,080
so beware of comparing real results

1046
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:55,360
with imaginary what-if benefits because

1047
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:58,000
opportunity cost is the thing and there

1048
00:33:55,360 --> 00:34:01,439
are many other reasons that's not

1049
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:03,120
a fair comparison okay

1050
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:05,519
so now with this hindsight in the

1051
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:07,518
remaining 10 minutes that we have

1052
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:09,119
what i would like you to do is take your

1053
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:10,879
neighbor's card

1054
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:12,159
so hopefully uh what you wrote there is

1055
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:15,199
at least say for

1056
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:15,679
your neighbor to see and uh let's talk

1057
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:17,678
about

1058
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:18,800
what you would do differently after

1059
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:20,720
having

1060
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:22,079
heard this and if you didn't write

1061
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:23,520
anything or if i don't think anybody

1062
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:26,000
came late

1063
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:28,320
here are a fair failure scenarios that

1064
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:30,800
you can seize your conversation with

1065
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:34,639
is it a failure that oss licenses didn't

1066
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:37,440
cover the services that they're built on

1067
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:39,520
or is it a failure and an irony that the

1068
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:41,280
my personal info can be locked behind a

1069
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:43,520
proprietary database

1070
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:44,560
using open source software i don't own

1071
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:45,679
the data

1072
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:48,480
but the software that was used to

1073
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:50,399
capture my data was open source

1074
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:52,320
or is it a failure that many open source

1075
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:55,598
projects by some estimates 90

1076
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:59,760
plus have no committers after a year

1077
00:34:55,599 --> 00:35:01,520
or the easy one is it a failure

1078
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:04,079
that i'm showing this presentation to

1079
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:06,000
you using close source software

1080
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:07,440
on a closed source operating system well

1081
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,320
don't take that one the answer to that

1082
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:10,240
is easy

1083
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:11,520
uh just you should have used libreoffice

1084
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:17,839
on linux right

1085
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:17,839
okay so take a minute and let's do that

1086
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:45,839
shouldn't miss my life

1087
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:21,839
okay i think the decibel level in the

1088
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:23,200
room

1089
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:27,839
is telling me that people are having

1090
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:27,839
interesting conversations

1091
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:33,280
can you hear me okay so thanks for that

1092
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:35,839
this is really good that you're talking

1093
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:38,320
about failures with such an energetic

1094
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:39,759
uh and kind of vociferous style that's

1095
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:41,839
what i wanted you to get into

1096
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:43,839
talking about failures because as i said

1097
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:45,920
success and failure

1098
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:46,960
in the success and failure in the open

1099
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:49,280
source land

1100
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:51,440
are really two sides of the same coin

1101
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:53,440
perhaps even the coin is heavily loaded

1102
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:55,200
on the side of failure because we fail

1103
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:57,040
more often than we succeed

1104
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:58,399
so i'm actually very heartened and very

1105
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,920
pleased that people were talking about

1106
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:01,680
well i'm assuming failure because that

1107
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:03,280
whole talk is about failure

1108
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:05,759
keep doing that keep talking about

1109
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:09,200
failures sharing the whys the what

1110
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:09,839
the the stories as i said all of those

1111
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:13,200
things

1112
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:14,799
are important failure is important

1113
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:16,319
but there is a distinction and it's a

1114
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,839
little bit sober one that we need to

1115
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:23,839
know

1116
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:23,839
how many people know what statue that is

1117
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:32,079
yeah people think it's a thing i think

1118
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:36,640
there's a similar one this actually

1119
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:39,839
is um it's able i think no it's not me

1120
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:42,879
it's able and um

1121
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:45,520
abel obviously failed

1122
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:46,960
but here's the deal his failure was not

1123
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:50,960
recoverable

1124
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:54,240
so that's why all he had was regrets and

1125
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:55,599
that's the key thing to avoid fail often

1126
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:57,359
but avoid regress

1127
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:59,440
regrets are the things where you just

1128
00:37:57,359 --> 00:38:01,200
are eating that are eating up inside of

1129
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,839
you and you're like i wish i hadn't done

1130
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,759
that

1131
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:05,119
there is no way time machines are i

1132
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:06,560
don't think they're possible and

1133
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:08,160
even if they are theoretically possible

1134
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:09,599
we don't have them yet so you literally

1135
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,960
can't go back in time and

1136
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:13,119
change the decision that you made in the

1137
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:14,960
past no way you can do that

1138
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:16,560
if that's the source of your regret

1139
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:20,960
don't have that

1140
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:20,960
fail but don't have regrets

1141
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:35,759
so here are basically the uh

1142
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:37,520
seven ethics i put them down if you want

1143
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:38,640
to take a picture i'm sure the talk will

1144
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:40,400
be shared

1145
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:41,920
uh or slides will be shared later on as

1146
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:45,040
well but here are those

1147
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:46,960
uh in in one slide hopefully

1148
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:49,440
legible enough from the back and of

1149
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:53,040
course continue the conversation

1150
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:53,040
on the website as well

1151
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:59,759
here are the various ways to stalk me

1152
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:01,040
i'm not particularly active on twitter

1153
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:03,680
but please do

1154
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:05,920
reach out to me on linkedin or follow me

1155
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:07,118
on my blog or email me

1156
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:15,839
thank you so much you've been all

1157
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:15,839
awesome give yourself an advice on

1158
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:20,560
and i believe we have a few minutes for

1159
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:20,560
questions so

1160
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:31,520
we have a few minutes for questions and

1161
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:31,520
i will repeat the question

1162
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:40,240
so there's only two things that might

1163
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:42,480
have happened either i convinced

1164
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:44,160
everybody or i convince nobody

1165
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:45,599
so i'm going to be an optimist and take

1166
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:46,319
with a former but if you do have

1167
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:48,000
questions or

1168
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:49,839
criticisms by all means approach me now

1169
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,200
or later um

1170
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:52,480
otherwise i know we have to end like

1171
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,439
five minutes early for people to clean

1172
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,880
up thank you again

1173
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,920
for a wonderful being a wonderful

1174
00:39:54,880 --> 00:40:01,959
audience

1175
00:39:55,920 --> 00:40:01,959
[Applause]
