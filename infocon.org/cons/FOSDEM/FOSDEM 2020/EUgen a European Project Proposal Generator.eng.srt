1
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,639
good evening

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:13,599
everyone today i want to

3
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:13,599
talk you about

4
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:22,240
better today i wanted to talk you about

5
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:22,720
this little piece of software that i

6
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,759
wrote

7
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:28,720
for myself a few months ago while i was

8
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,279
writing a project proposal for the

9
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:31,679
european

10
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,679
mission

11
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:40,078
so this is a little bit of trying

12
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:43,440
first of all i'm going to

13
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,160
give a brief overview about the typical

14
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,440
project

15
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:50,078
structure since i guess that

16
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:52,079
not everyone here wrote project

17
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:55,680
proposals

18
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:59,280
then in this way i will be able to

19
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:01,600
describe the the problem that i wanted

20
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:04,879
to solve

21
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:07,040
and we'll talk a bit about the code

22
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:07,920
about the plugin structure that i guess

23
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,360
it's a

24
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:14,479
a cool feature of this program

25
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:17,039
and then work in progress what i'm doing

26
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:17,039
right now

27
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:25,200
so you have your project

28
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:28,560
you have people working it

29
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,479
and the work in the project is split

30
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,520
into work packages

31
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:34,560
you could have for example hardware

32
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:38,000
design

33
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:40,640
software design communication management

34
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,799
stuff like that inside

35
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:47,759
every work package you have task

36
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:48,320
so for example harder development can

37
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:52,840
have

38
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:55,839
hardware design prototype development

39
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:59,280
industrialization and

40
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:02,320
the tasks makes deliverable

41
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:05,119
that are stuff that you can

42
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:07,520
share you can show to someone else it

43
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:11,360
can be a prototype a document a website

44
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:15,120
video and while the project

45
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:19,120
evolves it reaches some milestones

46
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:23,120
that are moment in time when you you say

47
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:26,720
okay so far so good now what

48
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:29,760
for example you can have work package

49
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,319
hardware development inside that the

50
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,760
task

51
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:36,480
the prototype development gives you

52
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:38,480
a deliverable prototype and when you

53
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,280
have a prototype you say okay we have

54
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:43,200
prototype

55
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:47,200
now what we do okay

56
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:47,200
this is more or less the basic structure

57
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,519
so you have your idea for a research

58
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:54,319
project

59
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:56,720
you want to far to be funded you need to

60
00:02:54,319 --> 00:03:01,359
describe it to the european commission

61
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:04,000
in order to get your funding

62
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:06,159
and how do you that well there is a

63
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,280
format that is more or less standard

64
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:10,720
if you wrote a research proposal you

65
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,840
know that

66
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,480
you have work package cards with the

67
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,000
network

68
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:19,359
package the effort of every partner when

69
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,200
you start when you end

70
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:27,280
what you're going to do and the tasks

71
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:31,359
we've started and date and so on so

72
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:34,000
and deliver also besides

73
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,040
the work package cards you are also

74
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,159
asked

75
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:40,000
to produce some summaries

76
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:42,720
such for example the list of

77
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,720
deliverables

78
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:49,760
the list of milestones

79
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:51,920
and in the case of european project a

80
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:54,879
summary of the effort

81
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:56,000
by my work package with partners and so

82
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:59,040
on so

83
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:02,560
and last but not least a graphical

84
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:05,120
description of your project

85
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,599
what is the problem here this makes

86
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,200
sense

87
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:12,399
okay we can agree

88
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:15,679
what is the problem the problem is that

89
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:19,759
this description is

90
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:21,680
reasonable as maybe it's redundant

91
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:24,080
there is lots of cross-linking

92
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:27,440
cross-references

93
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:28,880
and if you change something you have a

94
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:32,400
tsunami

95
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:37,520
of change to do for example suppose

96
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:37,520
you add three months to task 1.3

97
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:42,000
then work package one needs to last

98
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,000
three months more

99
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,280
a work package two and three that starts

100
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,320
when working

101
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:50,880
one ends needs to start later

102
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:53,040
and the task inside them to start later

103
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:55,360
and the deliverable will get later

104
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,880
and the milestone will change and the

105
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:00,160
effort will change

106
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:03,360
you'll need to change everything

107
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,560
here here maybe the milestone will also

108
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,479
change order

109
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,840
because if one milestone gets later

110
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:11,599
maybe a new one gets the first

111
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:14,960
first so it's a

112
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:20,080
it's a mess okay

113
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:23,120
honestly i don't like this this kind of

114
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:26,080
and well you know

115
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:28,800
okay but you just need to pay a little

116
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:32,800
bit of attention

117
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:36,080
i don't want to pay attention

118
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:38,479
i have the deadline that's creeping

119
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,199
day after day closer and closer and

120
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:42,240
closer

121
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:43,520
i have a page limit of 15 pages that's

122
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,880
way too short

123
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,919
i don't want to pay attention i want a

124
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:51,120
software

125
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:52,639
that pays attention from me that's why i

126
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:56,320
love coding in other

127
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:56,320
the compiler pays attention for me

128
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:02,880
so i wrote this piece of software

129
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:03,840
you can imagine how much i hate this

130
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,319
stuff

131
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:09,039
since i wrote a software for just doing

132
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:09,039
one project

133
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:15,840
and this is the internal structure of

134
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:20,160
the code it's very simple

135
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:25,119
you have a parser that takes the project

136
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:29,280
in a simple format another standard

137
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:32,720
brings it into a internal format

138
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:35,280
this handle by this block

139
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,960
more about this later and the result is

140
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:40,479
given to processors

141
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:41,198
that do something in my case it

142
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:45,599
generates

143
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:49,759
some files that include in the project

144
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:53,120
the nice part here is that

145
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:56,960
parser and processor are not fixed

146
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,960
but are implemented as plugins

147
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:04,960
what that means it means

148
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,960
that i haven't

149
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:12,240
sorry i have as uh

150
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,400
said the code a an abstract password

151
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:17,919
that's in an interface

152
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:19,280
for those of you that are not familiar

153
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:21,919
with this part of ada

154
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:23,440
is more or less an abstract class

155
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:27,198
roughly

156
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:30,400
if you want a new part you derive

157
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:33,840
from this interface

158
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:37,039
provide a constructor function create

159
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:38,400
and the function parse that's it then

160
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:42,159
you register your new

161
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:45,840
parser with this function the user

162
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,840
when calls the program

163
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:53,039
specified the parser to be used inside

164
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,039
the command line

165
00:07:53,759 --> 00:08:01,280
at the moment there is only one parser

166
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:04,160
that parser this is a

167
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:05,119
format here i'm not going to the case

168
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:08,319
very simple

169
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:11,520
i want just to point out to two

170
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:14,160
stuff first the

171
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:16,719
data here for example is not a number

172
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:20,080
it's an expression

173
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:22,879
this allows you to specify for example

174
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,359
that one task needs to start when

175
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:26,479
another

176
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:29,520
task end in a very simple way and

177
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:32,799
the nice part is that

178
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:35,919
replacing this with an actual number

179
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:39,598
is not done by the by departure but

180
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:44,399
by but by the housekeeping

181
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:46,480
block here

182
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:50,720
so this means that if you write a new

183
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,720
parser you have this feature for free

184
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:57,119
and the other part i wanted to

185
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,160
show you that's uh more or less in

186
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,040
another dot but

187
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:02,800
it's worth saying you see here the

188
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:06,719
deliverable

189
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:09,279
and the date it has three dates

190
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,399
12 months one one year two years three

191
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:12,959
years

192
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:14,720
that's reasonable because sometimes in

193
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:17,760
this case for example is a

194
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:19,920
report during the project you have

195
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,279
a few records during the project so it

196
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:25,439
makes sense to have

197
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:25,439
some kind of periodic deliverable

198
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:28,720
at the beginning

199
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:36,320
i didn't take care about this

200
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:39,760
and the delivery just had one date

201
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:43,680
okay and this was a designed

202
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:46,080
design decision that was quite deeply

203
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,880
inserted into the code because it was

204
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:50,080
part and

205
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:53,279
sense of the model of the project

206
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:57,120
that i had in mind then you

207
00:09:53,279 --> 00:10:01,279
while writing the project it came out

208
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:04,480
that there are also period deliverable

209
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:05,279
i had to change this and this require

210
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,920
quite a deep

211
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:09,439
change in the procode because as i told

212
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:12,479
you it was a

213
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:14,640
part of the model that i used to do the

214
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:17,680
code

215
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:20,319
time to do the change

216
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,319
half a day

217
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:24,800
i was impressed with you i don't want to

218
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:28,079
do that i don't

219
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:31,599
know it's tomorrow too half a day

220
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:34,800
after at the end it compiled a runs

221
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:37,120
and it works that's what i love about

222
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,120
other

223
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:44,240
and here processor plugin this is the

224
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:48,560
output i'm not going to detect

225
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:50,959
the same stuff as before and

226
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,599
there are at the moment two plugins for

227
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:54,239
the output

228
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,839
one is dump as you can imagine is for

229
00:10:54,240 --> 00:11:00,240
debugging purposes

230
00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:03,440
the other produce a lot of latex files

231
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:06,640
and the high level aesthetic

232
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:09,680
is coded inside the other code

233
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:12,959
the most of the statics is called as lac

234
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:14,800
lattice macros but the high-level

235
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:15,439
structure is inside the other and that's

236
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:19,199
it's not

237
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:20,000
good i mean as long as i was the only

238
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,399
user

239
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,680
that's fine no problem if you want to

240
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:28,880
make it available to other people

241
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:32,160
sure so i want to

242
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:35,200
introduce this template-based

243
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:38,319
approach and

244
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:41,680
but this is still work in progress just

245
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:42,000
that you know that the latter plugin is

246
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:45,359
what

247
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:49,279
produces this this

248
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:53,120
this this this and this this is actually

249
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:53,920
a lattice feature was automatically

250
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,959
produced

251
00:11:53,920 --> 00:12:00,000
from this no

252
00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:03,119
from this and

253
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:07,120
let me tell you it saved me

254
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:08,800
lots of work lots

255
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:11,839
also including the work done for you to

256
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:15,279
write this

257
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:17,120
so the new template output processor

258
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:20,560
will be template-based

259
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:24,320
this is just a taste of the syntax

260
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:27,359
very php like as a

261
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:30,399
philosophy but

262
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:33,920
the language of the template i guess

263
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:33,920
you feel at home okay

264
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:42,319
so work in progress

265
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:45,760
uh more documentation actually it's

266
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:49,440
not so bad uh yes i want

267
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:53,760
to add mark down inside the content

268
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:56,560
let's go back here

269
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:58,959
here you see your work package this is

270
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:01,518
kind of attribute of the work package

271
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:02,638
and this is the content as you can see

272
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:06,240
this is latex

273
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:08,560
i want to move to markdown in order to

274
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,600
allow for different output format of

275
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,839
course

276
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,839
and

277
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:17,279
okay and they template the basic

278
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:20,480
processor

279
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:23,360
okay so this is the

280
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:26,639
almost the last slide some pointer to

281
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,639
the project to myself

282
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:38,800
and

283
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:41,040
no no no what are you doing

284
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,040
ok

285
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:52,859
ok

286
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:52,859
[Applause]

287
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:03,839
um

288
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:12,480
no not really honestly i

289
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:14,800
this is something that mostly i wrote

290
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:16,240
first for myself you know the opening

291
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,560
open source stuff start

292
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:20,399
from when you started try to start your

293
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:23,359
your reach

294
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:24,560
i published on github i guess that maybe

295
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:28,399
someone else could

296
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:28,399
be using for for that

297
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:37,519
that's it i guess it's a very

298
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:40,800
it's a an application and also a very

299
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:43,600
niche application okay it's not just uh

300
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:44,719
i don't know an editor that's a white

301
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:48,000
these uh

302
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:50,160
if you ever wrote european project

303
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,199
you know that this can save you at least

304
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:58,480
at me except

305
00:14:51,199 --> 00:15:00,319
me a lot lots of work

306
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,399
well maybe not much of a question more

307
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:06,079
of an observation the

308
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:10,320
eu proposal workflow must be

309
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:13,120
really painful if you actually decide to

310
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:14,800
write that whole stuff on the other hand

311
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,600
you know there's emma's project that

312
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,479
kind of

313
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,680
does something similar so i think there

314
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:23,360
might actually

315
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:25,760
be more it might be less of a niche

316
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:28,160
market when you think

317
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:30,880
if you if you're talking outside of eu

318
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:32,800
proposals you know projects are

319
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:34,560
delivered you know project plans are

320
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,758
delivered to all kinds of managers all

321
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:38,638
the time

322
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:41,279
yeah and you know they all have the same

323
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:43,839
dependencies in issues

324
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:44,639
uh so the surveillation was that maybe

325
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:47,120
if

326
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:49,440
it's outside of european proposal it's

327
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:53,519
uh maybe less than any issue

328
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:54,160
maybe yeah because you said niche market

329
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:56,720
so yeah

330
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:58,160
it looks at the first glance but on the

331
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,160
other hand where's the ms project and

332
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:02,639
they make big money

333
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,439
you know i come from the university so

334
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:07,040
i'm used

335
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:09,360
to right project for research proposals

336
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:11,599
and this is for european union but also

337
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:15,279
for italian

338
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:18,480
proposals it's more or less the same and

339
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:21,519
i mean you can do it okay and

340
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:24,399
let's face let's be honest it was also

341
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:27,759
fun to write the code

342
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:30,560
so that that was a part of the body page

343
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:33,680
and it was much more fun right in the

344
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,680
corner they can try to

345
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:38,079
and beside the fact of the code it

346
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:41,360
doesn't work for you

347
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:41,359
yeah and you have fun doing it

348
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,240
yeah but i know i guess that maybe the

349
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:48,240
same could be

350
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,519
useful for someone else at least in the

351
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,360
university

352
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:54,079
you see there also there is another fact

353
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:57,040
that it produced a lot of code

354
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:58,319
and usually european proposals are

355
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:02,839
writing evicting

356
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:06,799
board anyway

357
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:10,079
he maybe you could write

358
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:13,199
someone else who could write a

359
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:16,319
processor for open

360
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:16,959
open document so you can get open

361
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:18,879
document

362
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:21,199
format that you include inside the

363
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,679
different composer i mean this of course

364
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:25,199
is

365
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:28,480
by the way this also is quite young

366
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:33,120
i submitted the project on september

367
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:35,600
last year so this is uh

368
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:36,479
very very very young of course it's

369
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:39,199
suited for

370
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:41,919
to myself because i wrote starting to

371
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:44,320
scratch a problem of mine

372
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:46,240
but if there is input from someone else

373
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:49,039
and can be used to someone else

374
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,039
i will be happy

375
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:56,320
and you can integrate the dependencies

376
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,320
between the task

377
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:05,360
yes there is

378
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,840
yes

379
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:22,799
yes so the the question is if

380
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,639
it's possible to integrate the

381
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:27,039
dependence for tasks yes it's uh it's

382
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:29,360
almost automatic in this case with the

383
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:33,440
data expression so you say

384
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:36,879
this task begins when this one ends

385
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:38,559
there is not yet i plan to do then i

386
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:42,080
discovered that the

387
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:45,840
data was enough a formal dependencies

388
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:48,559
so this this task depends on that one

389
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:49,600
the there is not but if you look into

390
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:51,360
the code

391
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:55,280
you see that there is some kind of

392
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:59,199
placeholder to put this kind of stuff

393
00:18:55,280 --> 00:19:02,480
and that in my opinion that's it was the

394
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:05,840
most uh useful part

395
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:08,960
because uh otherwise my

396
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:11,600
experience in european project is that

397
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,720
you are at the point and you say okay

398
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:15,918
freeze it

399
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:18,240
don't change anything

400
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:19,120
don't don't ever try think about

401
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:23,200
changing

402
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:27,520
because in this case i could change

403
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:27,520
anything at the very last day

404
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:39,840
okay thank you
