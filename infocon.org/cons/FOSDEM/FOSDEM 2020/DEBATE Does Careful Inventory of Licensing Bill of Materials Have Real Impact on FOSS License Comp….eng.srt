1
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:13,360
all right we're just about to get

2
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:13,360
started with our next debate

3
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:17,759
so the next debate that we're going to

4
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:20,000
have is on the topic of

5
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,520
does careful inventory of licensing bill

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,720
of materials have a real

7
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:30,000
impact on fast license compliance

8
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:32,960
and representing the affirmative we have

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,880
jeff mccaffer and carol smith and on the

10
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,239
negative we have bradley and max

11
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,480
sills

12
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:39,519
so with that i will let you take it away

13
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,800
jeff

14
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:44,719
that's me am i on you are i'm on okay

15
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,239
so welcome everybody when i found out we

16
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:47,200
were doing excuse me uh richard do you

17
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:49,360
want to make a comment

18
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,360
yeah so so i think they they

19
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,800
reformulated or formulated the policy

20
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,519
statement so the policy statement

21
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,879
um is for the affirmative position is a

22
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,680
rigorous modern

23
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:01,680
false compliance process must prioritize

24
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:04,159
including an accurate inventory of fast

25
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:07,119
materials

26
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:08,240
there we go we good to go so i found out

27
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:09,680
we were going to do a debate i got

28
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,439
really excited because it was actually a

29
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,360
high school goal of mine to be on the

30
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:14,639
debate team but we didn't have a debate

31
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,400
team at my high school

32
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,080
so carol and i really got into this and

33
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,950
we're we're all uh

34
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,200
set to go so we're good

35
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:23,360
[Music]

36
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,119
it also turns out that i cannot see with

37
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:27,280
those glasses at all

38
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:28,880
so when i was on the plane uh over here

39
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,400
turn up bradley was sitting across from

40
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,720
me on the plane here and i asked him

41
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,400
so do we want to do this as

42
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:37,039
entertainment and education

43
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,960
or do we want to like win bradley said

44
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,560
win i want to win

45
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,399
and then when we started here he came

46
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,680
over he shook our hands that was very

47
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:44,720
gracious and he said i look forward to

48
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,439
doing battle

49
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,560
so that's just setting the context here

50
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:51,439
uh anyway

51
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:53,520
so yes uh the affirmative position a

52
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:55,839
rigorous and modern

53
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,119
compliance process must prioritize an

54
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,439
accurate inventory

55
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:01,200
it's very simple the scale at which

56
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:01,919
we're doing open source and software

57
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,640
today

58
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,960
uh just far outstrips anybody's ability

59
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,360
to

60
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,959
manually take care of or understand the

61
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,720
set of components they're using in their

62
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:12,720
systems

63
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:15,280
open source is showing up in all sorts

64
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:17,599
of non-traditional software environments

65
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,319
people who are accustomed to managing

66
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:20,640
open source

67
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:22,480
managing components they may have very

68
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,319
rigorous supply chain

69
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,679
uh muscle within their company but it's

70
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:27,119
typically uh

71
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,480
maybe hardware if you're a car

72
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,160
manufacturer you know they've got

73
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,399
amazing software uh

74
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,440
sorry amazing supply chain uh

75
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,879
capabilities

76
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,120
but really don't understand what's going

77
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:38,000
on with software so the only thing you

78
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,120
can really do

79
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,120
to help them is automate and have

80
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,280
rigorous control over the inventory and

81
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,800
put in place a comprehensive supply

82
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,840
chain system

83
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,840
fundamentally you cannot comply with

84
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,200
obligations you don't know you have

85
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,200
and if you don't know what software

86
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:57,679
you're using and what licenses they have

87
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:00,319
you cannot possibly comply so you must

88
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:03,360
have a comprehensive system

89
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:04,079
it turns out that within modern software

90
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,200
uh

91
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,800
systems something like 90 of them guess

92
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,518
it depends on who you talk to

93
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,560
have open source in them and on average

94
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:15,519
when you look at

95
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,879
github open source projects on github

96
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:20,080
they have

97
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:22,399
180 dependencies

98
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,920
on average right so that means you think

99
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,840
about what that means

100
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:29,200
any given random piece of software on

101
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:31,360
github depends on 180 other things

102
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,238
right so try to imagine you're building

103
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,319
a comprehensive

104
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:36,720
product or or offering whether you're a

105
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:39,040
government or a company doesn't matter

106
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,799
and you're trying to keep track of this

107
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:43,359
the open source that you're using

108
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,720
right at minimum you've got hundreds of

109
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,319
open source dependencies

110
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:49,359
you need to understand what they are and

111
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:49,359
what their licenses are

112
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:52,640
flipping it around the other way if you

113
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:56,720
take the top

114
00:03:52,640 --> 00:04:00,159
50 open source projects there are over

115
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:01,200
3.6 million other projects that depend

116
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:03,840
on them

117
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,879
so that the scale here is just crazy

118
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,959
right so without

119
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:08,959
because of the scale without a rigorous

120
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:12,239
inventory of your open source

121
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:13,760
you can't possibly manage it all now it

122
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:17,280
also turns out that uh

123
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:19,599
inventory itself is not enough because

124
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:21,599
things like uh knowing where the source

125
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,960
is so how many people here use package

126
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,639
managers

127
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:27,120
package okay so there's a lot of hands

128
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:29,120
going up for package managers

129
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,520
did you know that on average we looked

130
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:34,000
at the the data from clearly defined

131
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:35,280
which is a system we put up put in place

132
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,680
to track open source

133
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,719
uh compliance information if you go and

134
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,400
look at it we did a

135
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:45,120
fairly random sample of 200 000-ish

136
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,239
open-source current open-source packages

137
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,720
42

138
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,680
of them do not have any easily

139
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,160
discernible

140
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,080
connection to their actual source so

141
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,800
you've got foo version 1

142
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:58,000
and 42 of the time you will not be able

143
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:01,039
to find the commit

144
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:04,479
in a repository that corresponds to that

145
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:06,320
version of the package so if you had a

146
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:07,919
copy left requirement to disclose source

147
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,240
or whatever you would not be able to do

148
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:10,719
that

149
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,160
in 42 of the cases if you wanted to

150
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,479
understand in more detail

151
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,400
the licenses involved or the source code

152
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:18,320
involved in the package you're using

153
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,000
42 of the time you will not be able to

154
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,919
understand that

155
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
so that leads us then to the data side

156
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:26,159
of this so we've got inventory

157
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,440
but you also need the data because you

158
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,520
need to understand

159
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,479
you know that you're using foo but you

160
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,919
don't know what it is

161
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:33,520
you don't know what the license is who

162
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:36,880
the copyright holders are

163
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:40,400
how did what obligations you have

164
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:42,880
um so in the ideal case

165
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,560
uh the the components the projects

166
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,360
themselves would be producing all of

167
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,800
this

168
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,479
and making it easy for people to

169
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,360
understand but that's simply not

170
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:52,320
happening

171
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:55,199
and i think as part of the comprehensive

172
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:57,440
inventory and automation of compliance

173
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,960
we would be encouraging and facilitating

174
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:02,639
upstream projects

175
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:04,479
to be more uh explicit about their

176
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:06,479
their licenses their source code

177
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:08,639
connections their copyright holders

178
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:10,880
things like reuse software right awesome

179
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:13,120
project to help encourage projects to be

180
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:15,360
better wealth better formed with respect

181
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:18,240
to their compliance data

182
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,880
how much time do i have left oh okay two

183
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,840
months

184
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,840
um

185
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:25,919
so this is not a problem we're going to

186
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,600
solve quickly

187
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:30,240
right we got into this over a period of

188
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,560
time and it's a massive scale problem so

189
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,880
we

190
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,080
need to do it iteratively the first step

191
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,600
is knowing what you

192
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:38,880
what you're using and that is the

193
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:42,319
inventory side of things

194
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,319
actually i think that's all i had to say

195
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:51,039
so the cross-examination come on who's

196
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,039
going to cross-examine that one

197
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:06,400
hello

198
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:09,520
you look so handsome thank you

199
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:13,520
further into the frame there sure so

200
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:16,719
take a poor under love developer

201
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:19,599
from france germany belgium

202
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,960
they're not paid they are working on

203
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:22,400
free and open source software because

204
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:24,638
they love it

205
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,758
how much time and energy should they

206
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:28,160
spend

207
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:29,599
making sure that they can provide a good

208
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,000
bill of materials for a corporation that

209
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:32,719
won't pay

210
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,840
them well it's an interesting question

211
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,360
because i think they should spend as

212
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,599
little time as possible and that's

213
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,520
actually part of the idea of automation

214
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:41,199
is that we would have in place guard

215
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:43,039
rails that they would not so they would

216
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:43,520
not actually need to know much about

217
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:46,000
this

218
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,719
it would all mostly happen for free but

219
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,360
also

220
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,479
put it to you a different way if you are

221
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,879
an open source developer

222
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:54,800
small independent one in a company and

223
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:56,479
working with government doesn't matter

224
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,000
if you're putting out open source and

225
00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:00,318
you're distributing a docker container

226
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,240
for example do you feel you need to be

227
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:03,440
compliant with the licenses in the thing

228
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,560
you're distributing no

229
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:08,000
show of hands right so you need to be

230
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,720
compliant that small independent

231
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,879
developer

232
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,319
needs to be compliant we should they

233
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:14,639
should be spending as little time as

234
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:16,560
possible and the way we facilitate that

235
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:18,319
is through automation and rigorous

236
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:21,039
systems that understand the inventory

237
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:21,039
and obligations

238
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,039
you talk about a software bill of

239
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:30,719
materials how is that different from

240
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:30,719
the requirements of a given license

241
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,159
well i didn't mention the word software

242
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:36,640
bill of materials on purpose but

243
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:37,838
um because that has i mean does anybody

244
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,279
know what that means or how many

245
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:40,000
definitions do you have right like i've

246
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:42,559
got seven

247
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,480
so um so what are you proposing that's

248
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:46,319
different from license compliance

249
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,760
well it's not the the idea here is that

250
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,120
you know what you're using so you have

251
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:51,200
an inventory of what you're using

252
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,640
and you understand the characteristics

253
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,600
of the things you're using

254
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:57,360
whether that be the license requirements

255
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,959
the obligations and those licenses the

256
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,240
vulnerabilities or whatever

257
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:01,599
if you want to put that all together and

258
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,560
wrap that up and call it a softer bill

259
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,800
of materials

260
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:06,239
that that's cool and and i would go go

261
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,920
along with that

262
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,480
and that then would include a list of

263
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:12,160
the obligations that you have

264
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:23,279
does that answer your question i'm sorry

265
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:37,839
yeah it's great okay

266
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:37,839
yeah come on

267
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,640
so so jeff pointed out that i i want to

268
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,000
win this game and so we just shout from

269
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,360
the audience you can't win this game so

270
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,560
i'm not sure how to take that

271
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,600
um i i'm actually i'm i'm the statement

272
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,119
doesn't fit me i

273
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,399
i dropped out of high school debate

274
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,760
after the first debate because i

275
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:02,240
couldn't stand taking

276
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:04,000
a position that i didn't agree with i

277
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:07,360
agree with my position in fact

278
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,079
in most cases i agree with the policy

279
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,000
statement which

280
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:11,760
by the way does include a bill of

281
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,720
materials is part of what

282
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:16,399
our opposition is arguing for and i

283
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,360
think the bill of materials is a useful

284
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:20,800
thing

285
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:22,959
i think it has value the question is a

286
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,359
question of prioritization what is the

287
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:26,399
most

288
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:28,399
important thing we need to do

289
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:30,079
to yield this build materials and

290
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:33,440
otherwise generally

291
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:34,959
create good and coherent understanding

292
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,839
of what software

293
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:39,119
is in people's distributions and supply

294
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:41,920
chains

295
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,959
as it turns out there is a better

296
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:45,279
approach

297
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:46,160
than first trying to construct a bill of

298
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:49,200
materials

299
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:52,319
and prioritizing that if you first

300
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:55,360
construct the required source code

301
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:56,800
that you must disclose anyway under many

302
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,959
foss licenses

303
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,160
and you are sure that that source code

304
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:03,199
is the correct

305
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:06,000
source code for the binaries and other

306
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:07,040
items that you are distributing the

307
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,200
construction

308
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:11,439
of a bill of materials becomes quite

309
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,560
trivial in fact if you care about free

310
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,079
software you're just going to give all

311
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:17,839
that source code to everyone everywhere

312
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:20,880
and not priority proprietarize it

313
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:23,600
they build materials only of interest

314
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:25,839
in its isolation to those whose goal is

315
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:28,160
to make proprietary software

316
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:29,920
so as a free software activist which

317
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:32,399
many of you in the room are

318
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:33,439
i think you would prefer to focus on

319
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:35,440
something that

320
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,279
pushes towards software freedom rather

321
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:41,040
than aids and embeds

322
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:42,240
the proprietarization of free software

323
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,079
that source code that you might

324
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,560
construct will contain all the licensing

325
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:46,399
info

326
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:48,479
it will contain all the licenses that

327
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:49,600
you need it will contain all the

328
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,360
information you need

329
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,959
to figure out how to comply with those

330
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,200
license and disclose those licenses

331
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:56,638
downstream it contains everything

332
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,240
that would go into build materials

333
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:01,200
anyway just

334
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:04,480
give them the source code ultimately

335
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,480
this is a resource question

336
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:08,880
our opposition has already conceded that

337
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,920
this is a huge

338
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:13,920
problem that there are

339
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,199
hundreds and hundreds of dependency

340
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,639
they've even said

341
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:19,519
however that they can construct an

342
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:22,720
automation process and do this for free

343
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:26,160
many of the autom the the

344
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:27,760
problems of doing this via software are

345
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,680
various different complex graph

346
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,360
algorithms and so forth many of them are

347
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,479
proving to be np complete

348
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,480
many of them are proven to be

349
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,639
undecidable in computer science

350
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,720
these are not problems that we as

351
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:40,320
technical folks know how to solve

352
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,639
because computer science says

353
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,440
it's extremely difficult to solve them

354
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:45,440
so the

355
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,560
proposal that we can solve these

356
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:49,600
problems

357
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:52,479
by automation and therefore put no

358
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:54,399
unfunded mandate on upstream is

359
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:57,760
completely

360
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:58,959
incorrect ultimately construction of a

361
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:01,120
bill of materials

362
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:02,319
is an unfunded mandate to upstream

363
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,720
prioritizing it

364
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:06,399
is taking the work of companies who want

365
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:09,200
to make proprietary software

366
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:11,600
free software and requiring upstream

367
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:14,800
projects to do that work

368
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:19,440
ultimately if we simply require

369
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:22,319
the source code to be right and complete

370
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:23,200
we have de facto build of materials for

371
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,440
everyone who gets

372
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,240
copies of that software and we've solved

373
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,279
the problem

374
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:32,320
we don't need to prioritize isolated

375
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:34,939
build materials construction

376
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:42,760
and i yield the balance of my time

377
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:42,760
[Applause]

378
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,959
all right am i i'm on good so well thank

379
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,079
you bradley that was uh that was

380
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:53,279
illuminating

381
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:54,719
um so it was interesting that

382
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:56,320
i would like to hear your response to

383
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,720
when i asked how many people here use

384
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:00,160
package managers and i would say

385
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,800
the majority of the people put up their

386
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:04,719
hands um what's your feeling about that

387
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,839
did that was that a good thing

388
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,920
is it a good thing to use package

389
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:09,199
managers a question i think it depends

390
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,240
on the technology you're using i don't

391
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:11,199
think that question could ever be

392
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:14,000
answered in

393
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:14,719
the abstract okay so we also observed

394
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,199
during my

395
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,480
my presentation that 42 percent of

396
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:19,839
package manager

397
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,519
packages in the package management

398
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:23,199
ecosystems do not

399
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:25,680
identify readily their corresponding

400
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:28,800
source code this is a challenge to

401
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:30,880
how would you view this as

402
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,920
corresponding to your desire to disclose

403
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:34,480
uh source code

404
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,920
as being the solution to compliance well

405
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,000
again i would say that

406
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:39,120
uh you may be making the case there that

407
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,120
prioritization

408
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,959
of improving package managers for source

409
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,639
code disclosure might be a good idea

410
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:47,199
but that's still not prioritizing bill

411
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:47,199
of materials

412
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:53,920
it in terms of bill of materials perhaps

413
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:56,079
not but in terms of enabling automation

414
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:58,000
and rigorous inventory it would be would

415
00:14:56,079 --> 00:15:00,638
it not well many of the package managers

416
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,240
already do have source code provision

417
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:03,440
for example if you take debian's package

418
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,880
manager for example

419
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,720
take fedora's package manager for

420
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,920
example the two largest and most used

421
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,320
distributions

422
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:12,160
all of them have a clear way to rebuild

423
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,839
from source code into a package

424
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:15,199
right and do so for all their

425
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:17,360
dependencies

426
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:18,880
yes unfortunately not all ecosystems are

427
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,720
as well formed as their amazing

428
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:22,160
partners we have in debian and and so

429
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,519
forth how would you

430
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:25,760
deal with them well i think it would be

431
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:28,000
wonderful if you wanted to fund work on

432
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:30,000
package management as a corporation

433
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,759
for those ecosystems but again that is

434
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,880
still not prioritizing bill of materials

435
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:34,959
it's prioritizing

436
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,920
package management which has all the

437
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:38,880
things you want

438
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:39,360
to simply fall out so then in our final

439
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:42,720
minute

440
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:47,120
can you define bill of materials i

441
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:48,639
am on the negative side i am arguing for

442
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,639
something different but would you like

443
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:51,600
to do arguing you should we should not

444
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:52,959
have bill of materials

445
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,720
you must have a definition of bill of

446
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:57,119
materials i am arguing that

447
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,399
everything that i've ever heard proposed

448
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,079
in your affirmative statement or any

449
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:02,480
other statements about build materials

450
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:03,279
is available as part of the complete

451
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,040
source code

452
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:07,120
that is correct for a givens piece of

453
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,880
software unfortunately except the

454
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,440
correspondence between what i'm actually

455
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,519
using

456
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:13,440
and what the source code is which is the

457
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:15,519
critical link that's missing

458
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:17,120
well i would i would answer that with if

459
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:18,399
you don't have the complete source code

460
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,079
of what you're running

461
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:21,680
you have bigger problems than not having

462
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:22,479
a bill of materials you can't even build

463
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,560
your product

464
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:26,560
but i would argue that's a subjective

465
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:28,638
process point not a

466
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:30,239
qualitative compliance point if you can

467
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:31,600
tell me how to rebuild a binary without

468
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:34,160
source code i would think that would be

469
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,680
an amazing thing to learn

470
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:38,560
but not not everybody needs to be able

471
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:41,120
to rebuild those their packages

472
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:43,518
from source code that's not a question

473
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,519
that's true

474
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:53,600
so i i wanted to build in the

475
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:55,120
affirmative on on a lot of what

476
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,959
jeff was saying and i wanted to

477
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:59,680
particularly emphasize

478
00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:01,439
the importance of thinking about the

479
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:03,120
reality of how modern software

480
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,959
development is done today

481
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:07,439
i think bradley is arguing for a

482
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:09,600
position that absolutely in a utopia

483
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:11,199
in the ideal case would work for

484
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:12,958
everyone all of the time and that we

485
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:15,439
would all be living happily together

486
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:17,679
all using free software but the reality

487
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:19,919
of modern software development is that

488
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:21,600
as pretty much everyone in this room is

489
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:23,120
using a package manager many package

490
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:24,480
managers don't include the link to their

491
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:27,198
source

492
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,919
and indeed i i could as a software

493
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:30,960
developer

494
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:32,000
at my small non-profits that is under

495
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,360
resourced

496
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,440
that's trying to get its website

497
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:38,559
constructed

498
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:40,320
choose to only use those packages and to

499
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:43,280
be quite precise

500
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,918
every time i npm install anything

501
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,000
checking

502
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:48,720
each individual package to make sure

503
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:51,760
there's a clear link to its source

504
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:54,000
i could but that's not the reality of

505
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:55,440
how we do modern software development

506
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,760
the reality is

507
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,880
and again i want to echo jeff's point

508
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:02,080
about scale

509
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:03,200
the reality is that there are people

510
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:05,360
working every day

511
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:07,120
in small organizations large

512
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:10,159
organizations individuals

513
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:12,320
who are installing packages and

514
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:14,240
uh and taking on hundreds if not

515
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:16,080
thousands of dependencies each time

516
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:18,480
on behalf of their company or on behalf

517
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:20,399
of themselves and they are taking on

518
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,520
the all the compliance obligations of

519
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,200
every single

520
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,559
piece of software that they are taking a

521
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,960
dependency on

522
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:28,879
and the reality is they're not checking

523
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,720
to see if each of those has

524
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:33,360
a source location can they can they

525
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:36,000
build from source every single time

526
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:37,520
and uh unfortunately this is the world

527
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,919
that we live in and indeed

528
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:40,720
uh the world that bradley is talking

529
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:43,360
about would be

530
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:44,880
an ideal world to live in but we live in

531
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,678
a world in which we need to create

532
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:49,440
practical

533
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:52,640
pragmatic responses and solutions

534
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,919
to to enabling develop software

535
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,480
development at scale

536
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:57,600
and and in the at the speed and and

537
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,840
efficiency that

538
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:01,520
that we need now the important point

539
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:03,600
here is that we still need it still

540
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:05,600
needs to be accurate and precise

541
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:07,439
much as the license requires because

542
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,159
compliance is the most important point

543
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,520
here we

544
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,440
we would need to be in compliance with

545
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:14,160
everything that we are using

546
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,480
uh but again uh there's the reality of

547
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,120
the

548
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:19,039
the way development works is that often

549
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,639
uh people are moving faster and not

550
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:22,080
not doing the due diligence that they

551
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:24,400
need to do and so what we need to do is

552
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:26,559
we need to put systems in place

553
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:28,320
through automation that will first get

554
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:30,480
an accurate inventory of the things

555
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:32,639
people are taking dependencies on

556
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:34,640
and second provide the information about

557
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,000
those pieces of software they're using

558
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,280
so that they can meet their compliance

559
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,799
obligations

560
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:42,720
and in fact this is a a problem that is

561
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:44,720
well suited for software development

562
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:46,559
because we are we are

563
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,480
we want to move efficiently effectively

564
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:50,399
pragmatically practically

565
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:52,000
and we can introduce as software

566
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,520
developers systems that provide

567
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,520
these guard rails that jeff was talking

568
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,400
about around the software development

569
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:58,720
process

570
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:00,240
we can these can these can be quite

571
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,440
lightweight systems and they can

572
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:05,120
accommodate

573
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:06,640
uh one-person software development shops

574
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,639
but it is still the case that even if

575
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,400
you are an unresourced one-person

576
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,440
software development shop working at a

577
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,240
non-profit

578
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:15,919
making it a hundred euros a year that

579
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:17,360
you still have compliance obligations

580
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:18,400
yourself and the software that you are

581
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,959
using

582
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:23,120
and yes that that person who's making

583
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,880
100 euros a year at that non-profit

584
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:26,239
might really want to live in bradley's

585
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,919
world where he

586
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:30,000
where she compiles everything from

587
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:31,679
source every single time

588
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,520
but maybe she doesn't and i think we

589
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:35,120
need to introduce systems and understand

590
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:36,000
that there could be processes that can

591
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:39,280
accommodate

592
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,720
those people as well and in fact if we

593
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:43,039
build these systems in this

594
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:44,400
in this way that we might actually be

595
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:45,919
encouraging people who

596
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,440
are sort of burying their head in the

597
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:50,000
sand if you will around

598
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,559
their compliance obligations to actually

599
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,200
uh

600
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:54,158
to move into a world in which they are

601
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,440
able to

602
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:57,280
comply with the software they're using

603
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,919
there they're actually instead of just

604
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,678
ignoring

605
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:01,919
the problem because they make 100 euros

606
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:03,520
a year at their at their small software

607
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:05,360
development non-profits

608
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:07,520
that they actually have a system in

609
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:09,760
place that provides them a lightweight

610
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:13,280
set of guardrails around providing the

611
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:15,360
list of packages that they are using

612
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:16,399
the license that is associated with

613
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:18,240
those components

614
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,159
who its copyright holders are if the if

615
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:22,159
that is applicable and this and a link

616
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:25,039
to the source location so that they can

617
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:25,440
then pass that along to their consumers

618
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:26,879
or

619
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,559
potentially work with the upstream

620
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,679
project depending on what this the

621
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:31,840
situation

622
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:33,520
may be and again i want to emphasize

623
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,879
that it's it's the reality of the world

624
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,918
that we're living in that that is most

625
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:38,720
important here

626
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:39,919
um i i can see that uh bradley lives in

627
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:42,640
a utopia

628
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:43,200
and and that uh it and that in fact if

629
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,360
if

630
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:47,200
if this were all readily available and

631
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:50,399
and and every time that i

632
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:51,440
ever uh consumed a a software package of

633
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,360
any kind it all

634
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,559
already had its link to the source and

635
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:56,080
it was clearly licensed

636
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:57,280
and i clearly understood all the

637
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,240
obligations that came along with that

638
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:00,158
license for

639
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,760
each thousand set of set of thousand

640
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:04,240
dependencies that i took

641
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:05,440
a dependency on i i would like to live

642
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,799
in that world too

643
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08,559
but instead what i would like to

644
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:10,000
emphasize is that we all need to still

645
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:11,120
meet our compliance obligations and our

646
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,640
compliance burden

647
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:14,239
and what's most important there is an

648
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,760
accurate inventory of the software that

649
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,919
you are using and depending on

650
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,799
and the data around each piece of

651
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:21,039
software

652
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:22,480
uh its license its source location and

653
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:24,320
its copyright holders

654
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:26,320
and that is what how i would define and

655
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:28,510
build materials by the way

656
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:35,600
i yield the balance of my time

657
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:37,679
[Applause]

658
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:39,520
so carol thank you for telling me that i

659
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:40,960
live in a utopia my first question is

660
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,840
given that i live in a utopia can you

661
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:44,400
explain to me

662
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:46,799
why most of the sorry why most of the

663
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:50,240
software in my utopia is proprietary

664
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:52,480
if it's my utopia because

665
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:53,360
in in your utopia you live in a world in

666
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:55,280
which people have

667
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:56,799
different views different visions

668
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:58,320
different they run different kinds of

669
00:22:56,799 --> 00:23:00,720
businesses and they have different

670
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:02,240
uh goals for the kinds of software that

671
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,360
they develop and the kinds of software

672
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:06,320
they want to use

673
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:08,320
and sometimes they want to make a choice

674
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:09,200
to use that kind of software that's not

675
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:11,918
always the case

676
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:13,280
so often they will use foss software but

677
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:14,480
it can occasionally be the case that

678
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,520
they have made a choice maybe that you

679
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:17,840
wouldn't make

680
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:19,039
i concede that but maybe they have for

681
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:20,320
themselves made a choice to use that

682
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:21,919
proprietary software

683
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:23,760
and i think those two can co-exist in

684
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:26,240
your utopia

685
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:27,600
so uh so you mentioned that there um

686
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:30,320
that licenses

687
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:31,678
uh involved require accurate and precise

688
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:34,158
billed materials can you give me an

689
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:37,280
example of a clause of a foss license

690
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:40,559
that requires bill of materials i cannot

691
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:41,918
but i i argue with the premise so it is

692
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:43,840
not in fact the case

693
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:46,240
that any of the licenses require a bill

694
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:48,320
of materials however the licenses in and

695
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:49,520
of themselves do have other obligations

696
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:51,520
and if you are not aware of those

697
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,879
obligations without having gotten a list

698
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,279
of the things you are using in the first

699
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,880
place

700
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:57,039
you cannot comply with those obligations

701
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:58,960
by definition and

702
00:23:57,039 --> 00:24:00,960
can you tell me what percentage from

703
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,919
your point of view of resources should

704
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:04,400
be spent

705
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:06,480
on building build materials instead of

706
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:08,320
checking to make sure you can reproduce

707
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,760
uh items from source code what how do

708
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:11,039
you divide up the percentage of

709
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,480
resources that ought to be spent

710
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:14,640
i think that would be a larger

711
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:16,000
discussion and we as a community that we

712
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:18,799
as a community should have

713
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,559
around it uh how proportional it should

714
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:22,158
be to the amount of people that we think

715
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:23,840
are in non-compliance or built

716
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:25,120
burying their heads in the sand because

717
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:26,080
they don't realize that they're using a

718
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,918
particular component

719
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:29,678
that's licensed and licensed in a

720
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:31,360
particular way and

721
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:33,679
and we have to address those in

722
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:34,158
proportion to the number of cases that

723
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:36,000
we

724
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:38,400
we see we see in in the field if you

725
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,360
will and how do you respond to folks who

726
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:42,480
say that if you

727
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:44,000
focus on reproducible builds uh which

728
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,600
you've conceded we'll also yield the

729
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,919
correct bill of materials if it's used

730
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:49,600
universally it also solves other all

731
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:50,000
sorts of problems like security and so

732
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,678
forth

733
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,880
so how do you argue for saying you

734
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:54,640
should keep the narrow focus of

735
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,919
prioritizing build materials over this

736
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,760
other solution

737
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:59,279
that would actually not only help with

738
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,720
the build materials issues but a whole

739
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:02,480
swath of other

740
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:04,080
issues that we have in software uh

741
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:06,159
because i think again i think that you

742
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:07,760
have to co-exist because it is the case

743
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:08,400
i i absolutely agree with you that for

744
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,879
example

745
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,520
uh debian has essentially solved this

746
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,200
problem

747
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,559
but not all ecosystems have and again

748
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,080
going back to people make different

749
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:17,678
choices and different decisions

750
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:19,120
um some people are living in software

751
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:20,480
development ecosystems

752
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,600
that are not as well constructed as

753
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,039
debian and i think we need to

754
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,559
accommodate them we need to bring them

755
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:25,440
in we need to have conversations with

756
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:29,590
them because they have the same

757
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:34,930
compliance obligations that we do

758
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:34,929
[Applause]

759
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:43,039
are we doing questions

760
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:59,679
my friends

761
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:02,559
who profits

762
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:02,559
who profits

763
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:06,400
from a software bill of materials

764
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:11,840
that's all i want you to ask yourselves

765
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:25,520
jeff used words he used scary words

766
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:29,520
that made me feel sad

767
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:29,520
jeff wants to enable automation

768
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:33,600
the other side wants a rigorous

769
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:37,039
inventory

770
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:39,918
we must mitigate risk

771
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:40,480
so i want you to check in on yourselves

772
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:43,520
just take

773
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:46,559
take a moment and think

774
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:47,600
feel into this do we generate a bill of

775
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:51,520
materials out of

776
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:53,840
fear out of fear for getting sued

777
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:56,559
out of fear that we're not satisfying

778
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:58,720
our corporate overlords

779
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:59,918
or do we generate the source that is

780
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:02,960
required because we

781
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:06,320
love developing software

782
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:09,200
it really boils down to a choice between

783
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:09,200
fear or love

784
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:18,659
[Music]

785
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:22,640
now there are other problems with their

786
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:26,399
with their

787
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:27,840
other side as well the the behaviors we

788
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:31,120
do today

789
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:32,799
become the precedent for tomorrow

790
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:34,158
so think about this when you wake up

791
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:37,200
every morning

792
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:40,000
do you want to develop free software

793
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:41,520
or do you want to spend an endless

794
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:48,399
amount of time

795
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:50,480
creating spdx identifiers do people

796
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:54,158
enjoy this

797
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:54,159
is this fear or love

798
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:00,960
the whole point of open source

799
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:03,600
fundamentally

800
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:05,279
is about low friction it's about making

801
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:08,399
cool stuff that is fun

802
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:11,600
as quickly and cheaply as possible

803
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:13,520
and the people who support build

804
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,480
materials i think they found that there

805
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:16,559
was

806
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:18,240
not there were markets for fear there

807
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:19,840
are vulnerabilities in your code that

808
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:21,919
need to be scanned

809
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:23,520
we need to go back thousands and

810
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:24,799
thousands and thousands layers up in

811
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:27,840
your dependency chain

812
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:29,679
to identify all the potential problems

813
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:32,000
you might have

814
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:33,200
does this lead to better software who

815
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,600
thinks that would lead to better

816
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,600
software

817
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:45,678
we argue that you should have a bill of

818
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:49,678
materials

819
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:52,799
but we argue slightly differently

820
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:54,320
you should convey the source if people

821
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:57,360
ask for credit you should give

822
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:58,399
it when you when you compare between

823
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:01,600
fear or love

824
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:03,760
love is giving developers credit love is

825
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:05,360
funding developers

826
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:07,360
love is making sure that the actual

827
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:09,678
software development ecosystem is

828
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:14,559
supported

829
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:14,559
fear is creating an industrial complex

830
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:20,320
without benefiting anyone i'll you the

831
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:27,120
rest of my time

832
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:31,279
i have to cross-examine you

833
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:35,199
but max the most important question

834
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:38,159
do you choose love over fear

835
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,960
even when it's hard and particularly

836
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:42,000
when it's hard

837
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:45,039
when you're doing software development

838
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:48,320
with tens of thousands of engineers

839
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:51,120
or tiny financial resources and

840
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:52,559
and can you really choose love even in

841
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:55,600
the most difficult dark

842
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:58,960
times and even under the constraints

843
00:29:55,600 --> 00:30:02,080
of finances resources

844
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:04,159
how do how does one really choose love

845
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:06,840
i think it really we need to define what

846
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:09,679
a software bill of material

847
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:11,600
is

848
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:13,120
i think you should do your best to

849
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,918
understand where your software is coming

850
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,678
from

851
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:17,360
i don't think that means you need to

852
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:20,000
contract with the vendor

853
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:21,678
to integrate with clearly defined i

854
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,039
don't think that means you need to hire

855
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:25,520
a bunch of lawyers

856
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:28,320
who can hire more lawyers who can hire

857
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:29,760
another vendor to do an spdx or fusology

858
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:31,200
audit on your system and tell you

859
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:34,240
there's problems

860
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:37,840
i have another question please why as a

861
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:37,840
lawyer do you hate lawyers so much

862
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:44,320
i'm glad you asked i'm glad you asked

863
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:50,000
a law a good lawyer chooses love

864
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:51,360
what we want to try to do is actually

865
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,720
make a better world and the lawyers that

866
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:54,719
are in the room today care about the

867
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:59,279
free software movement

868
00:30:54,720 --> 00:31:01,440
i think that you have to do what you can

869
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:02,559
to make sure that licensure licenses are

870
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:04,720
respected

871
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:05,760
you have to do what you can to make sure

872
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,960
that you are complying with the

873
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:09,919
obligations of software

874
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:12,399
that does not mean creating additional

875
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:14,159
obligations that no one asked you to do

876
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:16,479
well i mean i i actually have a real

877
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:16,480
question

878
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:21,279
which i i feel like many lawyers have

879
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:24,240
advised

880
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:25,600
many small and large organizations that

881
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:27,360
the bill of materials that an

882
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:29,199
accurate inventory understanding your

883
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:32,158
compliance obligations is actually

884
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:33,760
the solution here so do you do you take

885
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:35,600
you do you disagree with all the lawyers

886
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:37,279
who have advised their clients and

887
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:39,760
no that is that is exactly what our

888
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:40,720
position is we should be conveying

889
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:43,120
source

890
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:45,120
we should be conveying license text we

891
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:46,959
should do our utmost but we should not

892
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:48,239
be putting an unfair obligation on

893
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:51,120
unfunded developers

894
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:52,480
to do unnecessary tasks but aren't we

895
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,600
really isn't the reality of the fact

896
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:55,039
that we're living in a world that we

897
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,439
should be doing that and that people

898
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:57,440
aren't

899
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:58,720
and that we still have to continue to

900
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:02,480
develop software living

901
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:13,600
within that world yes i agree with them

902
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:13,600
i yield the balance

903
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:30,880
my debating partner um whom i love not

904
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:34,080
hate

905
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:37,679
um is has brought up this idea of

906
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:40,559
of risk and risk

907
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:41,760
is the central question the compliance

908
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:45,600
industrial complex

909
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:47,360
wants those who adopt free software to

910
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:49,199
believe that it is inherently risky to

911
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:50,799
do so

912
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:52,880
there's only really one risk we heard

913
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:55,200
about this in the previous debate

914
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:56,799
mike my esteem colleague pam pointed out

915
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:58,559
that most of the compliance problems in

916
00:32:56,799 --> 00:33:00,720
fact all of the real compliance problems

917
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:02,879
are in non-copy left licenses

918
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:04,480
i'm sorry copy left in copyleft license

919
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:06,799
is that non-copy left licenses really

920
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:08,799
don't have serious compliance problems

921
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:10,960
what is the difference copy left license

922
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:13,679
licenses require disclosure of source

923
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:15,600
code and non-copy left licenses do not

924
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:18,000
when you infringe a non-copy left

925
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:20,399
license the remedy is simple

926
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,840
you are contacted by a developer whose

927
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:23,279
copyright notice wasn't in the right

928
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:24,720
place or whose credit wasn't given

929
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:28,080
properly and you give it

930
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:30,320
there is no risk there is no real risk

931
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:31,840
for a company the risk is not providing

932
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:33,760
the source code

933
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:35,760
i have done enforcement actions many

934
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:37,279
times in my life as most of you know

935
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:39,200
and occasionally they will give me a

936
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:42,159
bill of materials as an answer

937
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:43,200
to a request for source code as if the

938
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:46,000
bill of materials

939
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:47,039
is the source code for the project it is

940
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,679
of course not

941
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:52,000
however if i had the source code it

942
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:54,799
would include the bill of materials

943
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:56,240
automatically i believe firmly that a

944
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:57,600
bill of materials is useful and i

945
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:00,240
believe that bill of materials

946
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:07,678
exists in the source code disclosure i

947
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:09,359
yield the balance of my time

948
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:12,480
well you might notice that i started out

949
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:14,319
as a aggressive debater all dressed up

950
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:16,240
now under the covers it was actually a

951
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:18,800
mild-mannered open source developer

952
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:21,040
just kind of hanging out at this point

953
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:22,960
things are not always as they seem

954
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:24,320
so bradley asked a question earlier on i

955
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,918
think it was something to be effective

956
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:28,159
they need a license that requires a bill

957
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:29,679
of materials something paraphrasing that

958
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:31,839
and i would ask you ask is there a

959
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:32,320
license out that out there that requires

960
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:35,040
me

961
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:36,399
to build from source the answer as far

962
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:39,359
as i know is no

963
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:41,199
so the premise is that you all should be

964
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:42,719
building from source

965
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:44,158
but everybody who put up their hand when

966
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:46,158
you said you're using a package manager

967
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:48,000
are not building from source

968
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:50,079
so it's not a requirement it's an undue

969
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,079
burden to put on you

970
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:53,440
to build from source every the thousands

971
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:55,119
of things you use

972
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:57,119
so that you can meet the compliance

973
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:58,560
obligations that bradley's putting

974
00:34:57,119 --> 00:35:01,520
forward

975
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:02,078
now would also say in rebuttal at our

976
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:04,079
esteemed

977
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:06,560
opponents here have repeatedly said or

978
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:09,440
implied that somehow we are

979
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:09,920
proposing undue burdens on upstream

980
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:12,560
folks

981
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:13,440
in fact it's actually the opposite we

982
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:16,320
are hoping

983
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:18,160
we are trying to put in place automation

984
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:19,440
and facilities which actually relieves

985
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:22,640
them from

986
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:24,640
maintaining all of this compliance

987
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:26,960
information for the things they use

988
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:28,560
right because we recognized earlier that

989
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:31,119
as an open source developer

990
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:33,279
putting out software you are in fact

991
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:34,640
required to comply to the licenses of

992
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:37,359
the things you use

993
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:38,160
so you have this burden of compliance

994
00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:40,560
already

995
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:42,560
and we're proposing automation and

996
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:43,359
facilities to make that actually easier

997
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:45,119
for you

998
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:47,119
so that when you go to deliver your

999
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:50,160
software you are compliant

1000
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:51,119
for free or automatically there is a

1001
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:53,598
mild

1002
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:55,599
uh burden we'll say which you have

1003
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:57,119
already when you put forward a license

1004
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:58,720
if you put forward a license that says

1005
00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:00,640
something to the effect of

1006
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:03,040
you must include a copy of this license

1007
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:05,040
with with your software distribution

1008
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:06,960
there are actually many packages and

1009
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:09,520
package manager ecosystems out there

1010
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:10,160
where the producers the publishers of

1011
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:12,000
packages

1012
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:14,240
are not encouraged or facilitated to

1013
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,160
include the license in their package

1014
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:18,160
they're actually not making it easy for

1015
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,960
their consumers to comply with their own

1016
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:20,879
license

1017
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:22,480
similarly if you're supposed to uh

1018
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:24,079
attribute copyright holders

1019
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:26,240
if you don't put the copyright holders

1020
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:28,079
somewhere in your text we're not going

1021
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:30,479
to be able to attribute them

1022
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:32,480
so the requirement here the desire is to

1023
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:34,400
have people do this in a mildly

1024
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:36,480
structured way not as pdx

1025
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:37,599
necessarily right just that's not that

1026
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:39,680
is not has never been

1027
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:42,320
the proposal here it's that people put

1028
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:44,078
it in some place that's understandable

1029
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:45,440
that's it if people can understand and

1030
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:48,800
get clear clarity

1031
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:48,800
that is be clearly defined

1032
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:54,320
had to work it in somewhere to have

1033
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,760
their

1034
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:57,520
their compliance information clearly

1035
00:36:55,760 --> 00:37:00,560
defined within their code

1036
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:03,040
then it's easy to comply it's trivial

1037
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:03,040
that's it

1038
00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:09,839
um

1039
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:23,760
back and forth

1040
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:25,599
first i just wanted to say thank you

1041
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:28,800
this was a very exciting debate

1042
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:30,880
so much emotion and vim and vigor i can

1043
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:32,720
hardly contain myself

1044
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:34,640
um i wanted to let you know that

1045
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:37,040
bradley's utopia is actually

1046
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:38,000
close at hand i have to share with you

1047
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:40,079
the fact that using

1048
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,599
new geeks as a package manager with one

1049
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:43,520
command i can obtain

1050
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:45,200
exactly the source code for exactly the

1051
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:46,880
software that is installed in my system

1052
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:49,200
the transitive closure of that source

1053
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:51,359
code in tarball format

1054
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:52,960
and then i can rebuild it and there is a

1055
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:53,440
bill of materials but my question is

1056
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:55,359
about

1057
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:57,280
the bill of materials whatever form it

1058
00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:58,720
may take i'm curious to know

1059
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:00,160
do you believe that it's possible to

1060
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:01,359
actually understand all of the

1061
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:03,279
obligations

1062
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:04,880
and to comply with them because it seems

1063
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:07,119
that there are so many different

1064
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:08,240
licenses if you actually knew how

1065
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:10,079
they're all

1066
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:12,319
interlocking in your dependency tree

1067
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:14,400
there might be contradictions

1068
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:15,599
uh we do not take the position that a

1069
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:17,680
bill of materials will

1070
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:18,880
make the legal judgment for you of how

1071
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:21,759
your obligations

1072
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:22,560
interact uh simply that they that they

1073
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:24,880
may exist

1074
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:26,000
and and that in fact you you in the in

1075
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:27,760
the uh

1076
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,280
the world we're now living in you could

1077
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:30,400
in fact first of all be using a piece

1078
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,680
with software you don't even know you're

1079
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:33,280
using in the first place

1080
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:34,560
but more to your point that you could be

1081
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:36,000
using a piece of software and not know

1082
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:37,119
how it is licensed or that it is

1083
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:40,640
licensed

1084
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:42,400
we the the legal obligation interaction

1085
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:46,319
is entirely the work of a lawyer to do

1086
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:48,320
once you have that information

1087
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:49,839
i would also ask that disclosing the

1088
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:51,280
source does not absolve you from the

1089
00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:52,880
need to understand your obligations

1090
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:54,320
either so simply disclosing the source

1091
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:56,240
doesn't tell you that the licenses

1092
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:58,320
you're using are compatible

1093
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:59,598
right so that's not the answer you still

1094
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,000
need to interpret the licenses and

1095
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:02,880
understand

1096
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,880
the obligations

1097
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:07,119
yeah we can see it in both their their

1098
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:08,640
proposal on our counter proposal that

1099
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:09,280
you need legal judgment i think we would

1100
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,960
agree to that

1101
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:12,839
it's just much easier if you have the

1102
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:14,160
source code not just a mere build

1103
00:39:12,839 --> 00:39:16,799
materials

1104
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:16,799
i see thank you

1105
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:31,200
so since max opened the door to bringing

1106
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:31,200
crazy things into this discussion

1107
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:36,800
[Music]

1108
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:38,160
yes for those who propose that all

1109
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:39,839
people who are distributing software

1110
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:41,279
rebuild everything from source all the

1111
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:42,078
time have you considered the climate

1112
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:45,119
change impact

1113
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:45,119
of that sort of policy

1114
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:53,440
i i i don't as we've heard from

1115
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:54,720
from the new geeks project it's not that

1116
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:56,800
you must

1117
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:58,480
rebuild from source yourself the fact

1118
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:01,040
that it has been done

1119
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:01,839
and can be verified when needed is the

1120
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:03,440
important issue

1121
00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:04,720
i don't think everyone should always

1122
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,680
rebuild from source from the very

1123
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:08,078
beginning

1124
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:08,799
and we didn't argue that in our position

1125
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:10,640
statements

1126
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:12,079
we argued that it should be possible and

1127
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:13,920
the source code should be correct

1128
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:15,200
now at some place in the supply train

1129
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:16,079
that has to be verified and there is a

1130
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,359
matter of trust

1131
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:18,880
at some point where you have to trust

1132
00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:19,680
that someone in your supply chain did

1133
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:22,079
verify

1134
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:23,680
that it's built from source but that's a

1135
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:24,960
that's an unrelated issue

1136
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:26,640
to the question of whether we should

1137
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:28,240
prioritize building the bill of

1138
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:29,920
materials separate from that source code

1139
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:32,799
disclosure

1140
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:35,200
yes so actually i largely agree in the

1141
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:36,640
sense that uh if if we were able to go

1142
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:39,279
from binary package to

1143
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:41,118
exact source code in a very rigorous way

1144
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:42,880
i think we then all we really need is

1145
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:44,079
that inventory of and i'm not saying

1146
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,960
build of materials i'm saying the

1147
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:46,640
inventory

1148
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:47,839
of the components you're using so you

1149
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:49,920
know which source you should be

1150
00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:53,759
disclosing or which licenses you should

1151
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:56,000
be complying with

1152
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:57,200
so and and you you did allude to it here

1153
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,119
at the beginning but i'll just sort of

1154
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:00,960
clarify the point which is without a but

1155
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:01,760
this is for the anti-bill of materials

1156
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:03,839
people

1157
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:05,839
without a bill of materials how is

1158
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:07,200
someone supposed to make the analysis on

1159
00:41:05,839 --> 00:41:08,400
whether or not there are licensing

1160
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:10,560
compatibilities

1161
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:11,839
so you're telling me that i have to like

1162
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:13,839
go through

1163
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:15,440
hundreds of thousands of pages of source

1164
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:16,799
code to figure out exactly what's in

1165
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:18,480
there so that i can decide whether or

1166
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,119
not all of the license obligations are

1167
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:22,400
being met

1168
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:24,960
and why doesn't enlist make that

1169
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:25,680
the more feasible way to do it uh so uh

1170
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:27,040
to be clear

1171
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:29,520
we were not we were not taking an

1172
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:31,599
anti-build materials position um because

1173
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:32,720
carol spent an entire week reading

1174
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:34,400
debate theory

1175
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:35,839
i had to take a crash course yesterday

1176
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:37,520
um the debate

1177
00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:39,759
the debate strategy they would use was

1178
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:42,079
counter proposal um we proposed

1179
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:43,839
we countered with creating getting all

1180
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:45,680
the source code generates a

1181
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:48,000
adequate set of materials and

1182
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:49,919
information that would mitigate any

1183
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,280
risk that could possibly come up so from

1184
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:53,280
my point of view if you have the full

1185
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:55,359
source code that builds everything

1186
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:57,280
you won't have maybe in the perfect

1187
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:58,319
format like line by line the bill of

1188
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:59,280
materials but you're going to have

1189
00:41:58,319 --> 00:42:01,759
everything there

1190
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:04,720
that built it and you can easily study

1191
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:06,400
what's in front of you and figure out

1192
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:07,759
not the people who have to not the

1193
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:09,599
lawyers

1194
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:11,200
not the lawyers that you all concede are

1195
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:13,040
needed who have to make the license

1196
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:14,480
compatibility judgment call

1197
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:16,319
i don't have the ability to go through

1198
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:16,960
source code and say oh look you know

1199
00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:18,400
here is

1200
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:20,400
here is each package and what the

1201
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:22,400
license assigned to it is

1202
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:23,680
i think you're absolutely right i think

1203
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:26,960
we need a list

1204
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:30,560
of licenses we all

1205
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:33,359
we also need but that's not

1206
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:35,440
but the question is what is a bill of

1207
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:38,720
materials

1208
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:38,720
what exactly is it

1209
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:43,200
because all i've all i've heard is that

1210
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:45,280
it's a marketing term

1211
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:47,759
that gets sold to people who are afraid

1212
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:50,240
and don't understand open source

1213
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:52,000
the companies that come talk to us that

1214
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:54,879
try to talk about build materials

1215
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,280
talk about all the vulnerabilities that

1216
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:56,880
are

1217
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:58,079
that are in our software that need to be

1218
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:00,400
found and if we don't find them

1219
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:02,319
everything's going to be destroyed

1220
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:03,839
bill of materials is a term used for

1221
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:05,440
fear-mongering and i think fundamentally

1222
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:07,440
what we're against is fear-mongering

1223
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:08,800
but we absolutely support understanding

1224
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:10,319
what your obligations are

1225
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:12,000
and having them in a convenient format

1226
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:13,759
so that you can comply

1227
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,440
and i would i would add to that that uh

1228
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:17,359
that um

1229
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:19,280
we we think that it's going about the

1230
00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:20,640
hard way to try to construct the build

1231
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:21,280
materials without having the complete

1232
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,560
source code

1233
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:24,800
once you have the complete source code

1234
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:25,279
we can much more easily automate the

1235
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:26,880
process

1236
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:28,880
the process is hard to automate without

1237
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:30,880
having the source code first

1238
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:32,960
no you you i just want i just wanted to

1239
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:33,920
very quickly clarify that we are not pro

1240
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:37,680
fear-mongering

1241
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:39,680
[Laughter]

1242
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:41,200
so and just quickly max brought up fear

1243
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:42,640
and love there's another element to this

1244
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:45,040
is ignorance

1245
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:47,040
and living living in ignorance is not is

1246
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:47,440
not an excuse not a way to go about it

1247
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:49,040
so

1248
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:51,119
knowing what you have and understanding

1249
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:52,720
it is great having the source code and

1250
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:54,880
to understand licenses i mean

1251
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:56,720
felipe has his hand up back there he's

1252
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:58,400
done an amazing amount of work on

1253
00:43:56,720 --> 00:44:00,319
license understanding

1254
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:01,839
and going through like just parsing and

1255
00:44:00,319 --> 00:44:03,759
understanding oh that license text

1256
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:05,920
matches this actual license

1257
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:07,920
there are thousands of licenses and the

1258
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:09,520
matching algorithms as good as as much

1259
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:11,359
work as folks here have done

1260
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:13,280
are really horrendously hard to get

1261
00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:15,359
right so actually understanding the

1262
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:16,480
licenses in an automated way let alone a

1263
00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:18,319
human readable way

1264
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:20,240
going over thousands of components and

1265
00:44:18,319 --> 00:44:24,720
megabytes and gigabytes of source code

1266
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:24,720
is just not feasible in today's world

1267
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:29,280
so as a non-legal person i think you are

1268
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:31,599
all wrong

1269
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:32,480
because i think that one of the problems

1270
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:34,400
you didn't mention

1271
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:36,079
in in the debate between source code and

1272
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:39,440
bill of material as

1273
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:40,720
tools around that so you don't mention

1274
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:42,240
the fact that if you don't give the

1275
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:44,000
receipt to the people to build the

1276
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:45,839
software from the source

1277
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,599
you miss the point if you don't give the

1278
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:49,040
version of the compilers version of the

1279
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:49,680
various tools which are around you miss

1280
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:51,599
a point and

1281
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:53,359
by the way the gpl also requires that

1282
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:55,440
you provide information on how to

1283
00:44:53,359 --> 00:44:56,640
make the software so so i think that's

1284
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:57,760
an important part which has been

1285
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:59,839
completely

1286
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:01,040
avoided in the debate and that's a

1287
00:44:59,839 --> 00:45:03,759
mistake for me

1288
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:04,560
yeah and and i was although i i suppose

1289
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:06,480
i aired

1290
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:09,119
in my debate construction that i didn't

1291
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:10,640
um say that i was relying on the gpl

1292
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:11,920
definition of complete corresponding

1293
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:12,720
source code when i talk about source

1294
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:14,560
code i mean

1295
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:15,839
what the gpr requires which does include

1296
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:17,520
all the things you talked about

1297
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:20,960
as part of the scripts used to control

1298
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:20,960
compilation installation executable

1299
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:33,839
what side are you asking for jim i'm i'm

1300
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:33,839
filled with fear and love

1301
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:41,760
to be feared and loved but if you cannot

1302
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:44,800
be loved you might as well be feared

1303
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:46,880
um so i guess you know sort of question

1304
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:50,400
for the audience because i i've

1305
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:52,000
heard a lot of moaning about this in my

1306
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:56,240
own

1307
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:57,839
practice how how many in the audience

1308
00:45:56,240 --> 00:46:00,319
for from my own perspective and that of

1309
00:45:57,839 --> 00:46:03,359
that of our panelists here

1310
00:46:00,319 --> 00:46:05,359
actually mandate the builds

1311
00:46:03,359 --> 00:46:06,480
of open source components that are

1312
00:46:05,359 --> 00:46:08,319
consumed

1313
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:14,319
from source inside your organization by

1314
00:46:08,319 --> 00:46:17,200
show of hands

1315
00:46:14,319 --> 00:46:18,400
okay i'm calling that half-ish

1316
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:21,759
two-thirds-ish

1317
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:24,800
um and i guess that the question back to

1318
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:24,800
the panelists then is

1319
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:29,040
going back to jeff's point that a huge

1320
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:33,359
number of

1321
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:35,119
developers are consuming jars off maven

1322
00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:37,359
from for which they cannot easily

1323
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:40,640
identify the source

1324
00:46:37,359 --> 00:46:42,880
what's the positive solution centralized

1325
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:44,078
cicd that contains the compo the

1326
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:46,319
compilers

1327
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:47,200
and the source to the compilers that we

1328
00:46:46,319 --> 00:46:50,560
can all share

1329
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:53,759
and and you know and

1330
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:55,839
cryptographically digested links to

1331
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:57,200
confirm that those sources are the same

1332
00:46:55,839 --> 00:46:58,720
that we can all share how do we how do

1333
00:46:57,200 --> 00:47:00,240
we solve this problem

1334
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:01,839
i would absolutely love if we had

1335
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:03,200
reproducible builds across all the

1336
00:47:01,839 --> 00:47:04,880
ecosystems that we're doing

1337
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:06,879
that would be fantastic it would solve

1338
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:08,400
so many problems if only we could get it

1339
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:08,800
right like the debian and other folks

1340
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:10,160
have done

1341
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:13,520
but the reality is we're not living in

1342
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:14,240
that world and um i will briefly put my

1343
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:15,599
work at

1344
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:17,118
the sulphur feeding conservancy on and

1345
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:17,520
say reproducible builds as a member

1346
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:19,839
project

1347
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:21,119
conservancy they do not merely want to

1348
00:47:19,839 --> 00:47:22,558
work on debian although that was their

1349
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:23,520
first focus they want to make all things

1350
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:25,760
reproducible

1351
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:27,839
and i would love if the even just a

1352
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:29,040
fraction of the billions of dollars of

1353
00:47:27,839 --> 00:47:30,400
resources that would be putting into

1354
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:31,759
build materials was donated to the

1355
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:34,640
reproducible builds project i think it

1356
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:34,640
would make a huge difference

1357
00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:40,160
i i would just add on to that that i i

1358
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:41,760
agree and i think we have to do both

1359
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:44,240
because we need to put in we need to

1360
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:46,160
have existing compliance processes that

1361
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:48,399
help with the compliance obligations

1362
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:49,598
today and then we need to also be

1363
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:50,960
funding and resourcing

1364
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:52,640
the things that will move us towards

1365
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:55,440
bradley's utopia but they are not

1366
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:55,440
mutually exclusive

1367
00:47:58,559 --> 00:48:01,760
uh so my question is kind of for

1368
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:04,000
everyone

1369
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:05,440
on the panel here and it's one really

1370
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:09,119
about culture

1371
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:10,559
and there seems to be one thing we agree

1372
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:11,359
on that there should be some sort of

1373
00:48:10,559 --> 00:48:12,880
inventory

1374
00:48:11,359 --> 00:48:15,200
whether we pull it from source or

1375
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:17,520
whether we create a bill of materials

1376
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:19,279
and when i look think of it culturally

1377
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:20,960
in terms of software development

1378
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:22,559
you have many more people other than the

1379
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:24,000
developers involved you have product

1380
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:26,400
managers

1381
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,680
project managers you have lawyers

1382
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:28,000
sometimes involved but you have all

1383
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:29,598
these

1384
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:31,200
other people making business decisions

1385
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:34,319
and others

1386
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:35,439
how do we culturally indoctrinate them

1387
00:48:34,319 --> 00:48:38,240
into the sort of

1388
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:39,920
the culture of open source so that if we

1389
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:40,479
take from the last debate where they

1390
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:43,040
said

1391
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:43,839
we may not need enforcement like legal

1392
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:46,640
enforcement

1393
00:48:43,839 --> 00:48:48,240
because businesses will do it themselves

1394
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:49,440
if we had a bill of materials that was

1395
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:51,598
always provided

1396
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:52,880
and part of the ecosystem so the project

1397
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:54,559
managers and

1398
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:56,079
investors always saw it and it was

1399
00:48:54,559 --> 00:48:56,960
always front and center not through

1400
00:48:56,079 --> 00:49:00,000
source

1401
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:01,440
but front and center wouldn't they then

1402
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,440
help be part of that culture so that we

1403
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:05,839
don't have to go to court to enforce it

1404
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:07,280
because it would be it'd be top of mind

1405
00:49:05,839 --> 00:49:08,640
and if that is the case

1406
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:10,720
then wouldn't we want to go towards

1407
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:13,279
build materials and work with our

1408
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:16,720
package managers to automatically create

1409
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:19,680
those but as part of open source culture

1410
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:20,879
i think that's a great question i do

1411
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:22,319
think that the true solution to

1412
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:24,800
compliance has to start with

1413
00:49:22,319 --> 00:49:26,319
a culture of compliance but i think

1414
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:28,480
people should be taught to enjoy

1415
00:49:26,319 --> 00:49:29,440
open source they should be taught to

1416
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:33,200
code

1417
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:35,040
and have fun and make projects some

1418
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:38,799
project managers lawyers product

1419
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:40,319
managers people who are in that chain

1420
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:42,000
there there can be a very unhealthy

1421
00:49:40,319 --> 00:49:44,800
culture of companies for

1422
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:47,359
the the notion that gpl is viral and it

1423
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:49,040
will infect the idea of infection coming

1424
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:50,880
everywhere and that's the kind of

1425
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:52,400
fear-mongering that that that i was

1426
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:54,480
referring to earlier

1427
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:56,880
the it really just boiled down to what

1428
00:49:54,480 --> 00:50:00,079
you define as a bill of materials

1429
00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:00,720
is it a thing that you use to avoid

1430
00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:02,559
something

1431
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:04,078
or avoid a risk that you're afraid of

1432
00:50:02,559 --> 00:50:05,680
that you don't understand

1433
00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:07,359
that makes you very uncomfortable and

1434
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:08,720
panicked or

1435
00:50:07,359 --> 00:50:10,640
is it a tool so that you better

1436
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:12,558
understand your software

1437
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:13,598
is it something that you do because

1438
00:50:12,559 --> 00:50:14,880
you're afraid you're going to lose your

1439
00:50:13,599 --> 00:50:16,640
job if you don't do

1440
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:18,079
or is it something you do because it's

1441
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:19,680
enjoyable

1442
00:50:18,079 --> 00:50:21,200
it helps you build better software it

1443
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:22,960
helps you support people better so i

1444
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:24,558
think that's the cultural thing is

1445
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:26,000
people have to be taught that this is

1446
00:50:24,559 --> 00:50:29,599
enjoyable and not just

1447
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,599
drudgery that makes no sense

1448
00:50:30,010 --> 00:50:36,559
[Applause]

1449
00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:36,559
we agree

1450
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:42,800
i'd like to make two two points not so

1451
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:46,319
much questions the first

1452
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:49,119
is that words matter

1453
00:50:46,319 --> 00:50:51,599
and beloved material is clearly a world

1454
00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:54,880
of the industrial world

1455
00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:57,200
it's been borrowed from the industry and

1456
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:58,079
if you go from industry to military

1457
00:50:57,200 --> 00:51:00,319
industry

1458
00:50:58,079 --> 00:51:01,200
industrial complex it's very short

1459
00:51:00,319 --> 00:51:04,880
distance

1460
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:08,160
and it's clearly a world so it's a

1461
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:09,280
bit of material is is about something

1462
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:10,160
that's been imposed to us by the

1463
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:14,079
industry

1464
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:16,720
that's one thing the second thing is um

1465
00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:18,240
ignore licenses for a second i think

1466
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:20,160
it's completely crazy not to build

1467
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:23,759
software from source

1468
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:26,480
it's similar to buying

1469
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:28,000
a phone that's been built from the sweat

1470
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:31,040
of child labor

1471
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:33,440
or eating gmo

1472
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:35,119
uh grown food and i think that's very

1473
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:37,920
responsible

1474
00:51:35,119 --> 00:51:38,720
leaving aside anything about license and

1475
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:40,480
peer monger

1476
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:42,959
that's it and i wanted to say make love

1477
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:42,960
not war

1478
00:51:45,359 --> 00:51:49,680
i i take a little bit uh i i think your

1479
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:50,960
shading on the question philly it might

1480
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:52,720
be a little too intentionally

1481
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:56,960
provocative and i'd like to just say

1482
00:51:52,720 --> 00:52:00,480
that's i i don't i take a little

1483
00:51:56,960 --> 00:52:01,119
umbridge with that um but i i agree that

1484
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:04,480
in fact

1485
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:06,960
uh it it may be the case that that folks

1486
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:08,400
all should be building from source and

1487
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:09,359
in fact they are making poor decisions

1488
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:11,280
for themselves

1489
00:52:09,359 --> 00:52:13,040
if they're not but people make poor

1490
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:15,599
decisions for themselves every day

1491
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:17,119
often decisions that affect other people

1492
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:19,839
and we still need to build

1493
00:52:17,119 --> 00:52:20,640
legal systems other systems in the world

1494
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:23,040
crosswalks

1495
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:24,558
that help put guard rails around people

1496
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:26,960
making bad decisions for themselves or

1497
00:52:24,559 --> 00:52:26,960
for others

1498
00:52:29,839 --> 00:52:37,839
i work on the fear side of the source

1499
00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:40,480
so and uh i'm debating every day with

1500
00:52:37,839 --> 00:52:42,400
my lawyers yeah uh what they need they

1501
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:43,440
want bill of materials you can't imagine

1502
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:46,160
how much

1503
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:47,119
so but where's then the way how how we

1504
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:50,240
can meet yeah

1505
00:52:47,119 --> 00:52:52,240
i i would like to support

1506
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:54,000
open source developers yet on the other

1507
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:55,359
hand i must fulfill the requirements of

1508
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:57,680
the legal side so

1509
00:52:55,359 --> 00:52:59,680
is it would it be a good idea out of the

1510
00:52:57,680 --> 00:53:01,839
all the bill of materials that we create

1511
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:02,879
somehow make that as a contributions to

1512
00:53:01,839 --> 00:53:06,160
the projects

1513
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:09,280
which would help them being acceptable

1514
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:10,960
for corporate consumers which would help

1515
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:12,720
increase the usage and then make a

1516
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:14,480
business out of that

1517
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:16,640
how can we bridge those two sides

1518
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:18,480
because i think we need to

1519
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:20,000
um i actually think the definition of

1520
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:20,800
bill of materials here is important

1521
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,800
because

1522
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:24,079
i don't think there's in i don't believe

1523
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:27,839
that there is any

1524
00:53:24,079 --> 00:53:29,680
um goodness to be had to upstream

1525
00:53:27,839 --> 00:53:31,279
projects for them to receive a list of

1526
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:34,078
the inventory i'm using and

1527
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:34,640
the product my production of my thing um

1528
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:36,640
i

1529
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:38,160
i don't think anyone needs my list of

1530
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:40,160
open source i'm using i think what they

1531
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:40,640
want is the source if i changed it and

1532
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:41,598
all the

1533
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:42,960
you know all the things that are

1534
00:53:41,599 --> 00:53:43,680
associated with the obligations of the

1535
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:45,280
license

1536
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:47,839
uh so i would not argue for upstreaming

1537
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:50,400
a bill of materials uh maybe others

1538
00:53:47,839 --> 00:53:52,319
would argue differently yeah i mean i i

1539
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:54,400
have been very concerned uh about this

1540
00:53:52,319 --> 00:53:54,880
issue for some time that this this idea

1541
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:57,040
of

1542
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:58,480
a perfect machine readable licensing

1543
00:53:57,040 --> 00:54:01,119
information which i think is a

1544
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:02,480
fiction anyway and that we've cut so

1545
00:54:01,119 --> 00:54:05,119
many corners that that

1546
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:06,800
the supposed uh computer-readable

1547
00:54:05,119 --> 00:54:09,359
licensing information in projects is

1548
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:10,720
really mostly inaccurate but even if it

1549
00:54:09,359 --> 00:54:12,720
were accurate

1550
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:14,480
it becomes trying to push it back to

1551
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:15,200
upstream becomes an unfunded mandate to

1552
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:17,440
upstream

1553
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:18,319
from my point of my point of view

1554
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:21,359
companies have

1555
00:54:18,319 --> 00:54:23,200
generally forgotten that most of the

1556
00:54:21,359 --> 00:54:24,960
reason that they want to use open source

1557
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:26,879
and free software is because

1558
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:28,079
it's saving them tremendous amounts of

1559
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:29,440
money from their own development time

1560
00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:30,480
they're getting lots and lots and lots

1561
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:30,960
of software they don't develop from

1562
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:32,480
scratch

1563
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:33,839
so if they have a little extra work they

1564
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:35,440
have to put into the build build the

1565
00:54:33,839 --> 00:54:36,880
bill of materials that they need

1566
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:38,720
which they can do easily from source by

1567
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:40,000
the way from my point of view um

1568
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:41,279
then they probably have to do that

1569
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,400
investment but it was probably a lot

1570
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:43,760
cheaper than it would have been to

1571
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:45,520
develop all that software from scratch

1572
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:47,280
themselves

1573
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:49,200
yeah sure you get the last word i think

1574
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:50,480
maybe i just wanted to point out once

1575
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:52,399
again i mean i largely agree

1576
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:54,480
but i do need to point out it's not just

1577
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:55,200
companies that that are on the receiving

1578
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:56,960
end of this right

1579
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:58,799
open source projects that distribute

1580
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:59,200
stuff also have to do all the compliance

1581
00:54:58,799 --> 00:55:00,880
so

1582
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:02,399
those open source projects now have the

1583
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:03,680
burden of going and reading all the

1584
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:05,839
all the source and finding all the

1585
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:07,839
licenses and interpreting them all

1586
00:55:05,839 --> 00:55:09,599
so that is that's there regardless it's

1587
00:55:07,839 --> 00:55:10,319
not just the big you know big companies

1588
00:55:09,599 --> 00:55:12,640
that are

1589
00:55:10,319 --> 00:55:14,880
uh what was me here it's everybody the

1590
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:20,160
ngos governments small projects

1591
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:20,160
etc so i think

1592
00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:24,960
so i think that's all the time we had

1593
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:28,160
for questions um so just to

1594
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:31,119
um ask the audience um how many of you

1595
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:32,799
felt that you um learned something from

1596
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:36,640
this debate

1597
00:55:32,799 --> 00:55:36,640
wow wow that's good

1598
00:55:41,119 --> 00:55:44,400
i have to admit i i actually thought

1599
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:45,839
this was really good um

1600
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:48,480
the last debate was really good too but

1601
00:55:45,839 --> 00:55:51,200
i um i was really impressed with this um

1602
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:52,240
i think many of the participants here uh

1603
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:54,480
hold some of these

1604
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:57,439
views uh in a heartfelt personal way

1605
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:58,960
although i'm not sure about max

1606
00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:01,119
but it was true can you ask if anyone's

1607
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:04,319
mind was changed yeah does anyone

1608
00:56:01,119 --> 00:56:04,319
was anyone's mind changed

1609
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:07,599
was anyone's mind changed

1610
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:20,459
well that's not necessarily bad all

1611
00:56:16,170 --> 00:56:20,459
[Applause]

1612
00:56:24,119 --> 00:56:27,119
right
