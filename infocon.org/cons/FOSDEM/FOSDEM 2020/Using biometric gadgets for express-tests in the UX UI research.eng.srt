1
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:13,040
okay start go there yep

2
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:16,079
so we're gonna have uh dimitri

3
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:20,480
talk to us about using biometric gadgets

4
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:20,479
for express tests in the ux ui research

5
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:29,039
okay do you hear me i think yes

6
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:32,800
as we are speaking about

7
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:35,040
uh some additional hardware automation

8
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:38,319
in usability research

9
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:40,800
uh it should be noted that obviously

10
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,879
measurements of some biometric

11
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:46,160
parameters in usability

12
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:50,640
are no way their new approach

13
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:53,279
there were extremely expensive devices

14
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,520
affordable by large companies and

15
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:59,600
laboratories

16
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:02,879
and obviously uh even if you were

17
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:05,199
uh an employer of such large company

18
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:07,360
or if you were working in such

19
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:11,439
laboratory you were unable

20
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:13,600
uh to use a large amount of such

21
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:14,479
devices in parallel because well you had

22
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,439
few of them

23
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:17,439
and not tense

24
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,839
and

25
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:28,320
last several years

26
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:31,360
we have seen a new wave

27
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:34,479
of really powerful

28
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:40,640
biometric devices

29
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:45,439
which are user grades

30
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:45,439
and extremely cheap

31
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:52,079
mass market production makes them cheap

32
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,079
and

33
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:55,680
of course they are targeted at

34
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,240
entertainment

35
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,520
and fitness applications as their

36
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,360
primary goal

37
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,600
but still they are producing

38
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:07,600
measurements of biometric

39
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:10,720
parameters um

40
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:14,560
with enough precision

41
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:17,440
which is well uh

42
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,480
it's a really attractive idea to use

43
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,280
these data

44
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:23,840
for something useful related to

45
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,840
usability

46
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:31,280
and let us speak about how

47
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,000
can we do it so uh

48
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:36,800
the typical scheme of testing with using

49
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:40,560
uh of some biometrics looks like this

50
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:44,720
you have a user a user is typing text

51
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:48,840
moving his well mouse or doing some

52
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:52,959
other things with the software you

53
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:55,680
are track time

54
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:58,000
possibly you track errors which user

55
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:01,840
makes while working

56
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:05,920
uh you monitor heart rate

57
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:09,760
it's the easiest parameter to track

58
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:14,879
also you may track attention level

59
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:18,319
with the consumer grade encephalographer

60
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:21,518
or you can even use

61
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:25,040
an eye tracking technologies because

62
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:29,920
computer games have reached this level

63
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:31,679
of biometrics

64
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,920
eye trackers for gamers are not so

65
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:38,239
widely used as joysticks and

66
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:41,679
some other gamepads but still

67
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:44,239
they are produced and they are in our

68
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:47,360
group of biometric devices we are going

69
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:51,200
to discuss

70
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:54,080
what can be measured for the sake

71
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,280
of usability research galvanic skin

72
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:58,400
response

73
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:02,319
unfortunately this parameter is

74
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:06,159
not measured by consumer grade gadgets

75
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:09,518
typically and it's a pity

76
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:12,640
because well it's the thing which is

77
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:13,599
really easy to measure and rather

78
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:17,360
informative

79
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:17,360
but we have heart rate

80
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,880
a lot of fitness trackers are monitoring

81
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:23,599
it

82
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:26,080
uh possibly we can use two fitness

83
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:28,800
trackers or some other tools to

84
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:30,320
monitor blood pressure but it's rarely

85
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:34,320
used

86
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:37,199
we have enough chip eeg

87
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,680
devices i mean electro encephalography

88
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:40,960
waves

89
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,400
measuring we have enough tools to

90
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:45,039
measure kinematic activity

91
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:47,840
and as i have already mentioned we have

92
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,840
gaze detection

93
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:53,040
what did we use ourselves

94
00:04:53,360 --> 00:05:00,880
in some usability tests express tests

95
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,880
comparisons

96
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:03,360
for

97
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:11,919
electroencephalography devices

98
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:15,280
the simplest uh one uh

99
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:16,479
is a neurosky mind wave it has a mindset

100
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:20,159
modification which is

101
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:22,639
um non-durable uh

102
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,360
just the construction was not very

103
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:26,000
successful

104
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,759
you will break it rather soon uh less

105
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,560
durable electro vents photography

106
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:32,240
devices

107
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:35,440
uh is so-called nikamini ears

108
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:37,039
which are well cat ears uh

109
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,479
placed on your head for the

110
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:41,759
entertainment purposes

111
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:44,560
which stand still when you are

112
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,520
concentrated on something they were

113
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,880
really popular

114
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:53,840
they used the same technology of

115
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:53,840
neurosky we are using for research

116
00:05:53,919 --> 00:06:00,080
yeah but well

117
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:01,679
we do not discard them here and more

118
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:05,680
comprehensive

119
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:08,639
eeg devices from emotive

120
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:10,400
frankly speaking these are more popular

121
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:13,840
among researchers

122
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:17,359
epoch and epoch plus the newer one and

123
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:19,520
uh the most new motive inside little bit

124
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:22,000
simpler

125
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,880
but still uh highly comfortable fitness

126
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,560
trackers

127
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:29,680
our own experience um

128
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:31,039
well feedback charge um from our own

129
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:35,039
point of view feedback

130
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:37,599
uh heart rate measurements

131
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:39,039
were the most precise we were using in

132
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:42,160
our research

133
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:45,599
uh unfortunately um open source tools

134
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:49,360
are not very good in getting data from

135
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:52,880
newer models of fitbit

136
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,680
fitness trackers and really easy to get

137
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:57,199
data from

138
00:06:53,680 --> 00:07:00,880
are xiaomi mi bands

139
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:03,280
and msfit which is

140
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:05,520
practically the same device from the

141
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:08,960
data acquisition point of view

142
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:12,639
uh if speaking about eye trackers uh we

143
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:13,520
have successfully used toby rex and tobi

144
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:16,720
4c

145
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:17,599
both are targeted at gamers i'll speak

146
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,720
about this

147
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:23,599
a little bit later um testing schemes

148
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:26,240
which we can use uh the simplest one is

149
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:27,520
an individual testing mode

150
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,520
so you have a computer with some

151
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:32,719
software you

152
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:37,520
are make user to

153
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:39,759
do any actions you write down logs

154
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:41,680
rather typical logs from the testing

155
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,639
program maybe logs from his biometric

156
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,919
devices

157
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:49,199
the ones you have squired and

158
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:50,878
were able to put on user and

159
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:53,759
uh the more interesting wearant is

160
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:57,280
parallel testing mode

161
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:58,400
you just run the same set of software

162
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,559
and

163
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,878
more or less than set of devices on

164
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:06,319
several users at once

165
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:11,120
you collect logs from all of them

166
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:13,680
and you may run all

167
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,919
data acquisition scripts in parallel uh

168
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,759
by a starting script

169
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:19,039
uh or you can make something more

170
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:21,360
comprehensive

171
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:22,159
we have created our own open source ux

172
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,199
dump

173
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:28,240
uh suit uh to carry on such

174
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:31,520
parallel testing which is

175
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:34,799
well the link is on the bottom but

176
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:38,559
uh either you are able

177
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:38,559
to have extremely cheap

178
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:45,839
mi bands or something like this and

179
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:49,120
this will allow you to have

180
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:52,640
a representative number of tests

181
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:54,240
in a reasonable time the main problem of

182
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:57,519
ux research

183
00:08:54,240 --> 00:09:00,880
uh is typically a small set

184
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:03,120
of users you were tested well obviously

185
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:05,360
most additional ways like questionaries

186
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,360
and

187
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:12,800
video recording and so on uh are

188
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:15,440
really time consuming and if you are

189
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:18,240
doing some biometric testing in parallel

190
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:19,200
you get a lot of data in a short period

191
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,560
of time

192
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:25,600
which is really attractive

193
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:28,959
of course well uh nothing to speak about

194
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:32,080
um the devices themselves

195
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:36,399
uh just how raw hatred or

196
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:40,000
raw eeg signal from some

197
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:43,120
frequency bands are looking

198
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,760
just an illustrative slide

199
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,399
um the most interesting part is getting

200
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:49,439
data

201
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:51,760
from the device devices are cheap

202
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,120
and affordable you have a lot of them

203
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:56,399
maybe

204
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:59,839
but now you remember that

205
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:03,200
their primary goal is nothing

206
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:06,640
about ux research they show

207
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:10,000
some pulse or anything on the screen

208
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:12,160
but typically not share this data with

209
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,160
you

210
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:21,279
several approaches are available to get

211
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:24,959
um something from them

212
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:28,480
uh the ideal variant is using universal

213
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:31,760
epi api uh like uh qt bluetooth

214
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:33,920
or blues most of them are working via

215
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:38,800
the bluetooth protocol

216
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:42,160
unfortunately it's as rare case

217
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:43,599
as it's only possible api from the

218
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:47,279
device vendor

219
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:51,040
uh two examples are present here

220
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:53,839
fitbit web api which is placed on a

221
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:56,319
separate slide because

222
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:57,519
it's something terrible and uh some

223
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:02,240
special sdk

224
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:05,360
like for example uh toby ice records one

225
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:08,640
which is also terrible but it's it is

226
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:11,760
not placed on a separate slide

227
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:14,959
um or

228
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,920
you can use special open source tools

229
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:19,920
which were written

230
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:20,959
by not by the developers of the original

231
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:25,199
device

232
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:28,959
but are able to get data from it

233
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:32,000
a lot of them exist and that's the most

234
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:35,599
preferable variant if you have choice

235
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,600
uh for example might wave

236
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,880
headset is sharing comfortably sharing

237
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,519
data

238
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:45,040
via the puzzle box synapse project

239
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:48,640
initially nero sky

240
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:52,079
wanted some money for the

241
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:55,360
simple suit which was just able to save

242
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:57,120
raw data but i don't think they

243
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:59,279
sell it anymore because uh good open

244
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:02,240
source tools have

245
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:03,519
superseded it obviously the same

246
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:06,079
situation is

247
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:07,519
true for fitness trackers and the last

248
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:10,000
one is file abstraction

249
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:10,720
it's well not real-time data acquisition

250
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,480
but it

251
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:17,440
also is a good thing to use um

252
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:19,200
i would say that the other really good

253
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:22,560
pulse matters we were using

254
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:25,760
are garmin fitness trackers and

255
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:27,199
um we didn't manage to get data from

256
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:30,480
them in real time but

257
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:34,639
if you put them into usb slot they are

258
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:34,639
pretending to be a flash drive with logs

259
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,320
so it's uh even simpler than we wanted

260
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:43,680
it to be

261
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,680
for our goals

262
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:51,040
um a little bit more about the vendors

263
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:54,000
providing a p here you see uh

264
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:55,920
the strange scheme of dealing with

265
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,040
fitbit fitness tracker

266
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:59,040
it is precise

267
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:04,079
well a few words about the precision of

268
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:07,360
fitness trackers

269
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:10,800
you may have heard that

270
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:12,720
um fitness trackers are not very precise

271
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:16,240
in measuring heart rate

272
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:20,000
uh but uh they are not very good

273
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:22,480
uh for active physical trainings

274
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,839
because when you wave your hands they

275
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:26,079
may lose contact

276
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:27,839
but actually our users are not so

277
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:30,880
physically active

278
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:33,440
and if there is contact there

279
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:35,439
is a good probability that this contact

280
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:37,600
uh with the optical sensor will not be

281
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:39,600
lost

282
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,199
but still fitness uh fitbit fitness

283
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:44,240
talkers are the better ones

284
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:47,040
um we were able to use to get

285
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,680
data in real time or almost in real time

286
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,319
but

287
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:52,079
the scheme is terrible at first you use

288
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:55,440
open source galileo tool to

289
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:57,199
download encrypted data which you cannot

290
00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:00,320
decrypt yourself

291
00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:02,079
then glio sends this batch of data to

292
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:05,680
the fitness web of

293
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:08,638
trackers vendor website fitbit.com

294
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:09,120
and then you use your own application

295
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,519
which

296
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:16,959
is authorized to get data from the

297
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:20,560
website and

298
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:24,239
the worst is toby

299
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:27,439
sdk there is old sdk which is

300
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:29,839
unavailable for downloading uh which

301
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,560
works with all the eye trackers and

302
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:32,720
there is

303
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:34,160
a new sdk which is available to

304
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:37,199
downloading and

305
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:38,880
which used which is named uh to be

306
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:41,760
usable with all eye trackers but

307
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:45,040
actually usable only with the last model

308
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:48,160
uh oh sorry

309
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:51,920
um so

310
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:54,560
you still have obstacles but

311
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,959
it's not too difficult to overcome them

312
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,518
so

313
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:59,040
you can calculate also duration of the

314
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:01,360
actions

315
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:03,279
you can calculate number of errors heart

316
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:05,040
rate attention

317
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:07,600
level a little bit more about the

318
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:10,240
attention level of the headset

319
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,240
it may be

320
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:15,279
calculated metrics from the vendor which

321
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,560
i used for

322
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:18,160
to measure main consent mind

323
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,199
concentration in games or you can

324
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:22,240
calculate

325
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:22,800
them yourself uh precalculated are

326
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:26,480
better

327
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:28,000
uh because they are faster calculated by

328
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:31,839
yourself

329
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:34,480
are more scientific a little bit

330
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:35,360
um case detection a little bit more

331
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:38,639
after you get

332
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:42,800
uh coordinates of this fixation

333
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:45,199
from your eye tracker

334
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:46,079
uh the best tool from our point to deal

335
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:50,160
with this data

336
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:53,599
uh is a gnu octave which aktaf is

337
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:57,360
actually a fork of matlab

338
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:58,399
and uh you can use uh three lines of

339
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:01,440
code to

340
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:03,839
plot all these gaze map or

341
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:05,199
you can use a little bit more uh

342
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:08,160
comprehensive script

343
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:10,639
the whole script is on the slide to get

344
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:14,079
nice heat maps

345
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:16,399
which as you of course know uh

346
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:17,439
show which parts of the screen were

347
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:20,160
mostly looked

348
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,160
during the test

349
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:26,959
types of test tasks

350
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:28,800
series of different type operations in

351
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:32,000
one program

352
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:36,399
user has a list of tasks to do

353
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:39,199
and by this way you can compare uh

354
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:40,800
two versions of one program or you can

355
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:44,319
compare

356
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:46,560
uh maybe uh two different programs of

357
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:50,240
the same area of application

358
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:53,439
and uh you can use different approach

359
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:57,199
long sequence of routine operations

360
00:16:53,440 --> 00:17:02,720
for example a lot of clicks

361
00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:02,719
or some key types or some other actions

362
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:09,119
few examples really few of them

363
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:11,359
uh one is comparison of the office

364
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:15,678
interfaces

365
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:18,399
here you see uh three office suits

366
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:19,120
uh two versions of libreoffice with the

367
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,640
top panel

368
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:25,520
and side panel and ribbons of

369
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:28,079
from one of the early versions of

370
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:31,520
microsoft office with ribbons

371
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:34,720
how the final results would look like

372
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:37,039
for example in our case

373
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:39,200
for overcomplicated interfaces like

374
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:42,320
office suits are have

375
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:44,400
not for immuno

376
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:45,840
if you have simple interface ribbons are

377
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,760
good for nothing if you have over

378
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:50,399
complicated interface then

379
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:52,720
more than half of your users work faster

380
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:56,000
with ribbons

381
00:17:52,720 --> 00:18:00,080
and smaller parts

382
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:04,000
work faster with a top or side panel

383
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:06,320
also you can compare

384
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,320
how

385
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:11,760
the state of the user is different when

386
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:16,080
he works

387
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:20,320
with not the best

388
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:23,600
suits for himself uh red background

389
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:25,760
means that these users

390
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:28,080
are better with top panel blue

391
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:29,120
background means that these users are

392
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:32,399
better with

393
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:36,239
ribbons and you can see

394
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:36,240
that physical load is higher

395
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:43,039
and mind concentration may be higher and

396
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:46,080
so on and you can compare

397
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:49,200
errors the other example

398
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:52,000
um of the second approach

399
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:54,080
um this is example of comparing

400
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,640
on-screen keyboards with the hardware

401
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,760
keyboard

402
00:18:54,640 --> 00:19:00,240
of some asus a small asus typical asus

403
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,240
laptop

404
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:04,240
you can see the same approach at first

405
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:08,320
of all

406
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:08,320
you compare speed you compare

407
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:16,399
errors and you can see uh

408
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:19,039
if someone had higher

409
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:20,559
errors rate lower speed but higher mind

410
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:24,320
concentration

411
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:27,840
in this case perhaps this person

412
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:32,159
was hardly working with the

413
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:36,000
less comfortable tool and

414
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:39,679
if the speed and my concentration are

415
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:41,760
high it's okay if the speed is low and

416
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:45,360
the mind concentration is high

417
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:49,919
it's the worst case for example

418
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:52,959
um the last slide i think is it okay

419
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:54,000
well uh so the conclusions are the

420
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:56,799
following ones

421
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,400
consumer grade biometric turns out to be

422
00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:02,000
enough nature

423
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:05,280
to produce us data usable in ux

424
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:08,240
ui comparisons even

425
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:10,158
some vendor driving metrics are good uh

426
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:13,600
if you compare

427
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:15,280
uh several suits then uh something good

428
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,240
is written here about biometric

429
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:18,879
indicators

430
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:20,480
indicators that well they are good i

431
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:23,840
think

432
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:27,520
and obviously

433
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:35,840
we can use these to save our time

434
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:35,840
well i'll save our time so thank you

435
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:44,000
yeah how do you select users for tests

436
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,600
because

437
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,440
for example you need to change the

438
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:51,360
medical cards because

439
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:54,080
someone can have higher low health rate

440
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:56,000
and also you can take for example the

441
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:59,039
experienced user who can

442
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:02,400
who already knows interface or have a

443
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:06,400
high typing speed so good idea

444
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:09,039
the better objects are users which

445
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:11,120
um which have the same level of

446
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:14,320
ignorance

447
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:17,760
in programs you are testing often

448
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:18,720
then um of course uh you should take

449
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:22,480
into account

450
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:23,360
uh external destructors uh you should

451
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:27,039
randomize

452
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:29,439
the order of suits uh you should do

453
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:32,080
some other things which are rather

454
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:35,120
typical for ux research

455
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:36,000
and what you can simplify along these

456
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:39,120
approaches

457
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,080
you can uh compare the results of the

458
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:43,439
same user

459
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:46,559
with several types of software

460
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:50,159
in this case his

461
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:52,559
well state or skills or anything else

462
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:55,500
are relatively the same

463
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:56,639
but still what about medical cards yeah

464
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:59,760
[Music]

465
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:02,240
of course but if you do traditional ux

466
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:04,080
research you have the same problems

467
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:12,000
and you still have to take uh these

468
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:14,240
factors into attention

469
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,240
you

470
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,880
oh
