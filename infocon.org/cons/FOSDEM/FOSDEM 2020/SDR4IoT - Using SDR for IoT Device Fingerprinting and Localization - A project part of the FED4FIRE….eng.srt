1
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:11,280
good afternoon everyone

2
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:14,480
i'm alex duke and i'm

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:17,600
i'm head of research at home

4
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:19,279
that is a design house working in the

5
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:22,080
field of the internet of things

6
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:22,480
we are in france in neon and we have

7
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,000
some

8
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:29,199
expertise in electronic design rf

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,359
wireless devices cloud application

10
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:32,880
also machine learning and we are

11
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:35,840
interested in

12
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,360
software defined radio and we are also

13
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,399
doing research

14
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,960
uh collaborative research and the

15
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:44,079
project

16
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:47,840
that i will show you this afternoon is

17
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:51,039
a part of part of them

18
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,800
so um i will try to explain what our

19
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:53,360
motivation where we want to use social

20
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,480
different

21
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,879
define radio and i will introduce the

22
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:01,599
fat

23
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:04,798
for fireplus h2020 project

24
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:07,760
and the wireless testbed

25
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:09,119
for wireless device rf and cognitive

26
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:12,240
radio

27
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:14,799
at emac i will show

28
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,439
how we can use this testbed how we can

29
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:18,080
access it

30
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:19,758
and deploy uh your own ignore your

31
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:23,200
software into it

32
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:26,880
and then i will uh

33
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:31,439
show um the first appear

34
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:31,439
the first results of our experiments

35
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,840
so we see that software different radio

36
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,159
is popularizing

37
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,759
and the cost of the device has become

38
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:44,799
lower and lower

39
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:48,799
and software library

40
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:48,799
like new radio is maturing

41
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,560
i see that there is a lot of interest of

42
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,880
sdr in

43
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,719
academia a lot of people more and more

44
00:01:54,880 --> 00:02:00,000
work

45
00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:03,360
more and more guys are using sdr

46
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,399
in academia and so we would like to use

47
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,840
it

48
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:09,440
on our own devices and to put what

49
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:12,239
academia is doing

50
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,520
and to put it into uh industrial and

51
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:16,720
commercial

52
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,920
products so we would like to use hdr for

53
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:21,760
fingerprinting

54
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:25,040
passive authentication like for pairing

55
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,040
and also localization

56
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:30,319
so the main application domain that we

57
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:34,400
are targeting is

58
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:34,399
for manufacturing for

59
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:42,319
wireless bench

60
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,959
or wireless robots or an autonomous

61
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:47,440
vehicle

62
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:50,879
in in arrows for instance and

63
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:54,879
also for a drone so we would like to

64
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:58,239
authenticate this device while they are

65
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:58,879
communicating and also locally localize

66
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:00,879
them

67
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:02,879
and to authenticate them according to

68
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:03,920
the localization so for instance if you

69
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:06,879
have

70
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:07,440
an autonomous vehicle that is moving

71
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:10,799
into

72
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:13,840
a warehouse we would like to allow

73
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:17,120
it to communicate and to send that out

74
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:19,840
if it's at a precise

75
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,840
localization

76
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:27,119
so we go to uh the paper and

77
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:29,040
go to the state of the arts and we see

78
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:32,720
that there are a relevant paper that

79
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:35,760
is already achieving quite similar tool

80
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:39,519
and quite similar research and

81
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:41,359
the last one is from the library i did

82
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:44,799
my phd and we have some

83
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:47,200
guys that's from our team tibovial that

84
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:49,519
also contributes to one of the of this

85
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,518
paper

86
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:56,480
but however all of the all of this

87
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:59,439
paper does not do not study

88
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,159
real-world iot devices most of them

89
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:03,599
doesn't

90
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:05,599
rely on conventional communication

91
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:08,640
protocols

92
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:11,439
some of them are not reproducible

93
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,000
other provide dataset but it is too

94
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:15,799
small

95
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:18,798
to then study them

96
00:04:15,799 --> 00:04:18,798
reliability

97
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:26,840
other c figure fingerprinting but

98
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:28,720
the knot doesn't move so we can't learn

99
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:30,719
localization and we

100
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,400
so we would like to do our own

101
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:36,080
experiments using

102
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,799
of the shelf devices and we need a wide

103
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,080
a large

104
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:43,199
test bed and to collect enough data and

105
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:46,320
do it in a reproducible way

106
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:47,199
so we go through the different test beds

107
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:50,080
that are

108
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:51,280
available remote test bed open test bed

109
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:54,880
and we see that there is

110
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:58,080
uh the fed for fireplace test bed and

111
00:04:54,880 --> 00:05:00,960
that is a research project uh for

112
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,440
uh that offer a federation of different

113
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:06,638
kind

114
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:10,240
of testbed across all the europe

115
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:12,800
and they also offer a continuous

116
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,000
call for sme so they provide a small

117
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,600
phones

118
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:20,479
to allow sme to access the test bed

119
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:23,039
provide feedback and do their own

120
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:24,880
experiments on the test base

121
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:26,560
so there are different kind of test beds

122
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:29,600
that are part of the fat for

123
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:32,320
fire federation and

124
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,520
so different kinds so wireless test bed

125
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:36,639
iu test bed

126
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:39,840
ct lab test bed also big data

127
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:40,560
hpc testbed and cognitive radio test

128
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:44,000
beds

129
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:46,639
and the one that particularly interests

130
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,199
us is a wireless ilab testbed that is

131
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:52,720
close to brixel

132
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:55,360
that it provides iot node wireless node

133
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,160
cognitive radio node a software defined

134
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,919
radio

135
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:04,240
and lot of tools that we could use

136
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:07,120
so here is a picture of the wireless

137
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,840
ilab test bed so it's kind of a big

138
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,880
warehouse

139
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:15,039
where sensor and wireless nodes are

140
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:15,039
put across the building

141
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:20,400
so there are two testbed in fact

142
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,680
the first one is the wireless i lab1

143
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:25,520
it's smoothly

144
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:29,199
focused on sensor ih devices

145
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:31,198
and the second one more focus on the

146
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:33,680
software different radio and they also

147
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:37,280
have wi-fi sensor

148
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:40,240
lte devices so you can also can

149
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:41,440
put your own device into it you can use

150
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:45,440
it for

151
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:48,240
lte research you can put your own

152
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:49,440
base station into it and use the

153
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,800
hardware that is

154
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:54,240
already in place and that's this one

155
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,759
that we will

156
00:06:54,240 --> 00:07:01,520
use because there are robots

157
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:05,440
there are a usrp and

158
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,440
that will show you a bit later

159
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,639
so for the device that's there uh for

160
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:13,599
the ih device that

161
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:14,800
are deployed in the building so they are

162
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:18,319
zoloftia with

163
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:21,840
2.5 gigahertz with ultrawide bonds

164
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:24,960
there are also zigbee and there are also

165
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:26,080
some other kind of sensors from not

166
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:29,599
extreme conductor

167
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:34,719
but it's only only on the wireless

168
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:38,319
ilab one and not on the wireless ilab 2

169
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:40,319
and about software defined radio devices

170
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:41,840
there are different kind of usrp and

171
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:44,800
also fpga

172
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:45,679
and all of these devices can be remotely

173
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:49,759
programmed

174
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:54,400
and you can access them remotely and

175
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:57,680
so in fact each node is connected to

176
00:07:54,400 --> 00:08:00,719
a kind of laptop it's usually an

177
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:04,720
intel nok with an embedded

178
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:08,240
pc and you can ssh

179
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:11,520
to to this node to this pc and then

180
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:13,520
access the node there are also different

181
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:15,758
nodes that are mobile they are put into

182
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:19,280
robots and you can control

183
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:22,319
the trajectory of the node so you can

184
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:23,359
collect data and send data while you are

185
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:26,879
moving

186
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:28,879
the wireless nodes

187
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,639
so here is a map of the different knot

188
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:34,880
that are

189
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:37,039
that are located across the building

190
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:38,399
and you can see there's gf different

191
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:41,679
kind of nodes

192
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:45,040
and you can select each node so how

193
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:46,560
you can access uh this nodes so first

194
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:50,319
time you can request

195
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:53,599
create an account on this webpage

196
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:56,880
on the ilab trajectory so

197
00:08:53,600 --> 00:09:00,480
it's open and i think that you can just

198
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:03,519
subscribe to it and fill the form and

199
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:05,279
they will probably ask you for the

200
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:06,080
reason you want an account what is your

201
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,000
project

202
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:11,680
and then they will approve their

203
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,680
accounts and you can access testbed

204
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:15,279
since the next step is to bruise the

205
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,200
available device

206
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:19,680
and do book to book them so you

207
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:22,160
basically pick the devices as you want

208
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,719
and you select them and you reserve the

209
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:27,839
nodes

210
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:30,880
during the time you want and then

211
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:31,519
provide the software to access then the

212
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,800
nodes

213
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:36,800
that is gfid so you install it you log

214
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:40,479
in you select the node that you

215
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:42,640
you are and you can then you clear

216
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,839
create the experiment so you select the

217
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:46,959
node you

218
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:48,560
set up the image

219
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:50,319
that you want to install that you want

220
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:54,000
to deploy and then

221
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:58,160
you can access to the to the shell

222
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,160
to remote sales rook ssh

223
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:07,200
so for about our experiment so we

224
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:09,600
use the mobile node and the nexus 6p

225
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,880
device is a smartphone that is on the

226
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:14,079
robots

227
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:16,399
because we can put into it

228
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:17,199
our own application so we create an

229
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:19,600
application

230
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,440
that is broadcasting bluetooth bluetooth

231
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:25,680
advertising packets

232
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:25,680
and we then

233
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:32,880
collect the data using software defined

234
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:37,920
radio using this usrp and we build

235
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:37,920
a basic

236
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:42,880
new radio application to collect the iq

237
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:45,760
data

238
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:47,360
to create our data sets and we also rely

239
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:51,360
on belay dumped

240
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:51,360
projects that is um

241
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:58,240
an open source code that is demoted

242
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,279
demodulating bluetooth advertising and

243
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,640
collects

244
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:06,720
them and so you can use it then

245
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:10,079
into your shark so here is a basic

246
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:13,200
uh flowgraph so you see that

247
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:15,760
we put first the iq data

248
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,440
into a raw file for further processing

249
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:20,480
to create our data sets

250
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:21,120
and on the same times we demodulate the

251
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:24,480
data

252
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:27,120
and create the packet so

253
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,320
we have two outputs first the raw eq

254
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:31,519
data and

255
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:35,440
the second the

256
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:35,440
the advertising packet into a pickup

257
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:40,160
so now about the scenario of

258
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:42,240
experimentation so first

259
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:43,920
we have the usrp that is receiving the

260
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:46,240
data and the smartphone that's

261
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:48,560
advertising the smartphone can move and

262
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:53,040
the usrp the receiver is fixed

263
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:53,040
um we then

264
00:11:53,279 --> 00:12:00,320
use sequentially the difference emitter

265
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:01,439
and at the same position with the same

266
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,920
receiver and then

267
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,959
we move them and we can use different

268
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,719
receiver

269
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:08,399
and finally we can use a different

270
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,800
smartphone at the same time to collect

271
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:13,279
advertising for different devices at the

272
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,279
same time

273
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:19,040
so here is a capture of the test beds

274
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,160
where we are while we are running the

275
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:23,120
experiments

276
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:26,399
so we can access to a live camera to see

277
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,399
what's happened in the test bed

278
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:33,760
and here is some picture of

279
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:35,279
the recording of the data and we display

280
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:38,639
the pickup

281
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:39,600
into wireshark and the thing that's

282
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:42,639
above it's

283
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:45,519
the remote shell that's connected to the

284
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:45,519
to the smartphone

285
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,959
so about the next step we will open

286
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,040
source

287
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:53,279
everything and write the communication

288
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:56,399
so everybody will be able to

289
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:58,720
reproduce this experiment and improve it

290
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:59,519
um we will also publish our data sets

291
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:03,120
and put

292
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:05,519
everything into the node

293
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,639
and then we will try different kind of

294
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:10,079
erf

295
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:12,639
protocol like zigbee and maybe ultra

296
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:15,199
right bones

297
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:16,000
and we also will use extensively the

298
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:20,240
robots

299
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:23,440
to move all these nuts

300
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:26,959
um now we have created a data set so

301
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:28,240
the next step is to rely on another kind

302
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:30,880
of testbed that is a

303
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,760
virtual lab that is a data center with

304
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:34,720
gpu

305
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:35,519
and we would like to do some machine

306
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,160
learning

307
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:39,440
uh with the data set to figure

308
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:42,880
fingerprint

309
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:46,880
uh the device to identify its devices

310
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:50,240
and also to localize them uh and

311
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:52,959
i think that's that and

312
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:54,639
uh we will also participate in the stage

313
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:55,680
two of the experiment that is another

314
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:58,720
kind of funding

315
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:59,199
that is providing by the test bed and if

316
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,160
you are

317
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:03,519
also interested in participating to to

318
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:06,560
this project you can

319
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:08,079
uh apply for for fronting i think that

320
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:11,439
they will be happy to

321
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:15,680
to have their have your own experiments

322
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:18,800
into it and provide feedback to to them

323
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:22,479
so uh before ending um i would like to

324
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:23,359
thank uh first the team at the wireless

325
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,160
ilab that

326
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,560
is supporting us during the experiments

327
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:29,839
um

328
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:32,479
also that our team at

329
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:33,920
we are in fact three guys working on

330
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:37,360
this project

331
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:40,079
and if you want to follow our

332
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:41,600
updates about this project we will

333
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:44,800
probably move to

334
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:47,519
other european ignorant days

335
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,079
in june in france i think that there is

336
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:50,320
a lot of

337
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:52,479
advertising about this event during the

338
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:56,720
today room and doing this for them

339
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:59,199
but we will be happy to meet you there

340
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,639
so i think that it's time for christian

341
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:03,519
feedback comments

342
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:04,160
and i will be happy to to have your your

343
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:13,839
feedback

344
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:13,839
about this pro project

345
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:28,319
but the sdr show only has two arrows

346
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:31,680
inputs

347
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,680
this is the arc direction

348
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:37,119
um do you know where the iot device is

349
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:40,079
located

350
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,079
yeah sure yeah

351
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:58,480
so how does the localization work yeah

352
00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:03,519
in fact we are using um

353
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:03,519
the iq data for for that

354
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:09,839
so in fact uh because we

355
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:11,920
remove the we can move all the nodes we

356
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:15,920
can move them across all the

357
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:18,880
all the uh all the building so

358
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:19,839
applying machine learning into that um

359
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:22,079
the fingerprint

360
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:23,040
is different according to the posi the

361
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:25,519
localization

362
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,160
into the building so it's not we don't

363
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:29,839
do to

364
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:31,199
triangulation or engulf of arrival or

365
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:35,519
something like that

366
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:39,279
yeah we don't need to have

367
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:41,120
my more antenna array at the receiver

368
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:44,639
for for that

369
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:47,120
yeah so in terms of your

370
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:47,120
processing

371
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:52,560
what kind of framework are you liking

372
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:55,519
software

373
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:57,040
can you reap it louder please so for

374
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:57,920
phase two of your project with your

375
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,759
server

376
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:01,439
um what kind of architecture are you

377
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:03,440
looking to go for in software

378
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:05,120
so if i want to write some algorithms

379
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:07,360
however is there any framework that you

380
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:10,319
provide to help with that

381
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:11,520
for uh for doing what follows the look

382
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,319
and you have your stack of servers at

383
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,959
the end though

384
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:15,520
presumably to do some iq data processing

385
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:17,600
right

386
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,879
yeah do you provide any software

387
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:21,839
framework

388
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:24,720
to assist with that process not yet no

389
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:24,720
not yet in fact

390
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,840
questions

391
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:43,200
i think that's it's uh on the on our

392
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:45,039
world map because there are some uh

393
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:48,559
sensor in the

394
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:51,679
i think it's a hundred a hundred

395
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:55,360
uh megahertz so i think that

396
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:55,360
we can try to try it

397
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,160
real world yep of your results

398
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,919
afterwards because your results may be

399
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:07,760
very specific to the environment you're

400
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:10,640
testing yeah um it's on the segment

401
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:11,520
we just would like to we just the next

402
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,520
step is to

403
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,559
develop algorithm and everything and

404
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:17,200
validate it

405
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:19,760
in the test bed and then sure we our

406
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:25,679
goal is to move it to the real world

407
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:25,679
yeah are there any other questions

408
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:43,600
sing none let's uh thank god
