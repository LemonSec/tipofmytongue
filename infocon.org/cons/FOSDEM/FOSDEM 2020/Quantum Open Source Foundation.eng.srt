1
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:08,719
so i'm going to be talking about the

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,200
quantum open source foundation

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,920
and the goal of this talk is to first

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,320
walk you

5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:15,679
through the story behind qsf how do we

6
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:19,119
get to this point

7
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:20,480
what is qsf about and what's the future

8
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:22,560
vision

9
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,240
in terms of like missions and goals and

10
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,479
this talk is also

11
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,320
going to be a lot about how you could

12
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,800
potentially get involved

13
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,320
because none of this could be done

14
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:35,360
entirely by

15
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:37,280
um tomasz and myself and the co-team of

16
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,879
qsf that i'll show you in a bit

17
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,440
so throughout this talk i'm going to

18
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:43,040
have this little small request stuck

19
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,199
which is going to pop up at random

20
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:47,360
places and it's going to like just

21
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,039
ask you about certain skill sets or

22
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:52,000
things that you might be interested in

23
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:53,840
and if anyone is interested in helping

24
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,480
just drop us a message

25
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,520
on the slack channel which you can join

26
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:01,279
through this link

27
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:03,280
or send us an email so first of all

28
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,040
what's the story behind the quantum open

29
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,840
source foundation it basically

30
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,240
all started with a small github project

31
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,080
that

32
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:12,720
back in the day i was hosting on my own

33
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,360
github and by now it's like on the qsf

34
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,158
github

35
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:18,159
and it's basically a list of all well

36
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:19,119
we're trying it to be all but there's

37
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:22,560
always some missing

38
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:24,240
um open source quantum projects um so we

39
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,880
broke it down into different categories

40
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:30,240
like full stack libraries simulators

41
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:32,640
compilers this category for quantum fun

42
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:35,360
where we have quantum games

43
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,439
and other things and each category is

44
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,920
broken down into programming languages

45
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:40,000
so

46
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,600
the goal is that if someone wants to get

47
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
into the space

48
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,798
and maybe like you know start a project

49
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,799
on

50
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:48,000
a quantum simulator and they happen to

51
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,159
be or they

52
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,159
might want to join a project and they're

53
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,079
very comfortable in common lisp

54
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:55,439
they can go to the category for quantum

55
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:58,000
simulators

56
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:59,679
and then look for common list subheader

57
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,240
and actually find all the projects that

58
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,600
are

59
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,240
implemented in that particular

60
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:08,160
programming language

61
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:11,038
um then like thomas and myself

62
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:13,200
had several publications of several

63
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:14,958
publications um in the quantum computing

64
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:18,238
space and we worked with all of the

65
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:20,800
various hardware players d-wave ibm

66
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:21,520
xanadu and righetti and at some point

67
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,400
this

68
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,680
journal plos one that is very focused on

69
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,840
open access

70
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,920
science approached us and asked us to

71
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,760
write a review paper on the

72
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,040
open source landscape in quantum

73
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,879
computing

74
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:37,040
and we were pretty excited about this

75
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:39,920
and we joined forces with

76
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:41,359
peter and we started working on this

77
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,958
project where the goal was

78
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,120
to kind of look into all the various

79
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:46,879
repos and also dive into the literature

80
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:50,000
on traditional open source

81
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:52,319
software engineering and figure out

82
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,360
okay what are best practices that the

83
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:56,319
community

84
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,840
should follow and do most of the

85
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:01,040
projects that are out there actually

86
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:04,720
adhere to these best practices

87
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:06,720
for me there was one particular learning

88
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:08,080
that i found very surprising there's a

89
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,480
thing called brooks law

90
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,280
and brooks law says that adding human

91
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,518
resources

92
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,560
to a late software project will make it

93
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:16,400
later

94
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,159
and for the people that have worked in

95
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,319
software companies that might

96
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:21,599
you might be able to relate to that and

97
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:23,359
it has to do with this law of

98
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:25,920
diminishing returns where

99
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,480
adding more bodies and resources to a

100
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,040
project

101
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,879
initially increases productivity at some

102
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,560
point you will start plateauing and then

103
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:33,920
adding more people you actually decrease

104
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,239
productivity because

105
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,599
the communication overhead just gets too

106
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,200
big

107
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:41,518
what i found interesting is that if you

108
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,440
look into open source projects and

109
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:44,560
that's independent of the

110
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,959
work that we did in the quantum

111
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:49,360
computing spaces out of this other paper

112
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:52,239
they actually found out that adding

113
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:54,319
contributors to open source projects

114
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:56,080
always leads to higher productivity more

115
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:58,238
commits more codes and more

116
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:00,799
more code and more features so i think

117
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:03,360
that's a pretty exciting finding

118
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:04,799
that like the way to like developing

119
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,080
software open source actually makes

120
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,519
sense

121
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,200
one of the problems though was that we

122
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:10,400
realized that this review paper is going

123
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,319
to get outdated

124
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,519
quite quickly because we can't really

125
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:16,000
update it

126
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:17,120
we could update the archive version of

127
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,399
it but we can't really update the

128
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,720
version that was published

129
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:22,560
in plus one and that's why we started a

130
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,479
website

131
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,160
and we hosted this evaluation and the

132
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:28,000
results of the evaluation on

133
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,360
the website of the quantum open source

134
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,400
foundation so that was kind of like the

135
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,759
first thing

136
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:35,840
that we did um as part of qosf and the

137
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:37,520
response was overwhelming and as part of

138
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:40,000
that we like started frost them

139
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:41,198
the quantum computing track in 2019 and

140
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
since then we've kind of like been

141
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:44,479
running various

142
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,880
events and and growing the idea of the

143
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:48,800
foundation and also kind of like adding

144
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:51,040
more things to it and we have quite a

145
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,759
big vision i would say for the future

146
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,479
but we need help to actually get there

147
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:56,960
so

148
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:59,758
that's how the core team looks like

149
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:01,599
right now mikael just recently joined

150
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:03,199
and he's working on a new program

151
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,800
program that i will be introducing in a

152
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:06,320
bit

153
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,840
and we're also working on building out

154
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:10,000
an advisory board

155
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:12,799
so right now that's will and josh and

156
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,120
we're looking to add more people

157
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,039
in the near future and the goal here is

158
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,520
to basically get advice

159
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:20,880
on the various aspects and that like i

160
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,560
will be talking about in just a second

161
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,360
but basically to kind of get high-level

162
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,880
advice

163
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:29,600
and guidance on various topics that qsf

164
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:31,120
wants to work on

165
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,759
but at that point i would like to point

166
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,400
out that without peter we would not be

167
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:36,240
here today

168
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,560
we wouldn't have not had a quantum

169
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,960
computing track at fosdem 2019

170
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,479
we would not have not have it this year

171
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,400
because he was like one of the main

172
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:46,960
driving forces behind the creation of

173
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,638
qosf but unfortunately he can't be here

174
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,479
today because

175
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:52,000
end of last year he embarked on a

176
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:54,400
mountaineering journey in

177
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,440
the himalayas and unfortunately got hit

178
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,479
by an avalanche

179
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,840
and never got back um so i just wanted

180
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:01,520
to

181
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,198
have us all appreciate kind of what

182
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,359
peter did for the community and what he

183
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:08,720
did for qosf

184
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:11,600
and yeah just honor him for that

185
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,479
so what is qsf actually about qsf is

186
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,639
about

187
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:15,680
supporting the development and

188
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,680
standardization

189
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,720
of open tools for quantum computing so

190
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,479
that's pretty

191
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,000
generic and wide and we want to keep it

192
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,960
that way because we want to be able to

193
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,639
kind of adapt

194
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:27,758
as things develop and ultimately it's a

195
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:30,800
community effort

196
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:32,160
between industry and academia and when i

197
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,840
say industry i mean the quantum

198
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,360
computing industry but also just the

199
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,840
traditional software engineering

200
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,840
industry

201
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,599
so on our website we have a manifesto

202
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:44,960
and there's like six

203
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:46,160
items that we want to focus on and

204
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,758
yesterday when i was looking back at

205
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,080
them and i was asking myself okay how

206
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:50,319
many

207
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:52,639
items does foster actually kind of tick

208
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:53,919
off it takes off four

209
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:55,759
where we have things like foster

210
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:57,359
collaboration between the hardware and

211
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:59,440
software community

212
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,039
incentivize and support the distribution

213
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,960
of free and open information

214
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:04,800
regarding advances which is what the

215
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,479
goal of today was to kind of like

216
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,440
showcase some of the new projects some

217
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:09,840
of the new

218
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:11,759
updates to existing projects and to

219
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:14,400
organize free and open conferences

220
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:15,199
and generally events that kind of

221
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,599
increase

222
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:19,199
the audience and the community for

223
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:21,280
quantum computing

224
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,800
on top of that we have that we want to

225
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,638
provide financial funding

226
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,400
which we have not gotten to yet because

227
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:28,319
we haven't really focused on getting

228
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,318
funding for qsf that much

229
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,599
and providing a forum where people can

230
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:33,440
exchange ideas

231
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:35,120
and that's the whole point of this um

232
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,800
slack channel that we are currently like

233
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,759
building up and which is supposed to be

234
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,039
a point where

235
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:40,880
you can connect with people that are

236
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:43,199
working on these projects that are

237
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,800
quantum physicists or people that are

238
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:48,720
excited and interested

239
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:50,879
in like helping out on existing projects

240
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:53,199
so in terms of the future missions and

241
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:54,879
goals we basically have kind of like

242
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:56,240
defined three pillars that we want to

243
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,680
focus on we have

244
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,840
a pillar that is about pushing the

245
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,759
boundaries spreading the knowledge

246
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:03,359
leveling the playing field and a

247
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:05,919
biannual qsf

248
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,440
price and i'll talk a bit more detail

249
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:09,758
about each one of these pillars and what

250
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:11,840
we mean with that

251
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:13,039
so first of all pushing the boundaries

252
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:15,359
is supposed to

253
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:17,120
bring together the quantum community and

254
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,479
advance the solution of outstanding

255
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,560
issues and problems

256
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:21,840
so what i mean by that is to basically

257
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,240
have a list

258
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:26,159
of open uncracked problems in the

259
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,840
quantum computing software space

260
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:30,000
the idea is that young researchers can

261
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:32,880
come to this list get inspired pick up

262
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,360
one of these challenges and work on it

263
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:37,120
and potentially also like get some links

264
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,839
and resources linked to that problem

265
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:41,279
that was compiled by other people in the

266
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:42,880
space so for example like one of the

267
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:46,399
things that

268
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:48,480
there's a shortage of is compilers

269
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:49,760
without me saying that you might not

270
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,760
know that

271
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,959
and you might find it out by like going

272
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,640
to that

273
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:56,399
github list that i mentioned earlier and

274
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:58,399
you will see that there's relatively few

275
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:59,519
projects there but there might be like

276
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:01,839
more

277
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:03,360
um hidden uncracked problems that you

278
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:05,200
wouldn't be aware of unless you like

279
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,000
spend quite a lot of time kind of diving

280
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,680
into the field

281
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,360
so the idea is to kind of like create a

282
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,439
quick entry point

283
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,279
um and that's the first time that this

284
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,720
little duck pops up because if you know

285
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:16,880
any challenges if you have any

286
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,320
challenges um as part of your project

287
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,959
that or that you have encountered as

288
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,360
part of

289
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:22,719
your academic career please let us know

290
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,519
so we can get started

291
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,519
building this list

292
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:29,360
the third the second pillar is spreading

293
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:32,160
the knowledge so this one is

294
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,959
very much about outreach and education

295
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,199
um

296
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:36,800
and the goal here like one of the things

297
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,920
that we're doing is hackathons and

298
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:41,040
workshops

299
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:42,399
so we did a workshop together with cern

300
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,399
that i will be talking about in a second

301
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:47,279
but the goal is also to kind of

302
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:49,279
widen the community by not just doing

303
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:51,360
hackathons and workshops for

304
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:52,800
i don't know phd's in quantum info but

305
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,440
actually for people that are new to the

306
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,120
field

307
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,880
so that means hackathons with quantum

308
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,320
newbies i have

309
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,000
this particular idea of like doing a

310
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,440
workshop with kids because there's like

311
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,560
actually some interactive

312
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,640
there's a startup that creates

313
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:06,079
interactive elements for kids that you

314
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,519
can kind of like stimulate quantum

315
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:09,359
circuits with

316
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:10,640
um and also like kind of focus on like

317
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,920
the older population

318
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,839
and just kind of like spreading that

319
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,439
excitement for quantum computing

320
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:16,959
and i personally always find it exciting

321
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:20,000
to see people

322
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:21,839
taking like maybe a day maybe two days

323
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,440
for them to actually run a program on an

324
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:26,800
actual qpu and also

325
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:30,000
understanding what that program does

326
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:31,599
so at this point this always takes quite

327
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,240
a lot of money running these events if

328
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,720
you know

329
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:37,040
how and where a software foundation like

330
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:39,120
us could get grants or funding from

331
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:41,279
please approach us and let us know

332
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:43,200
especially if you've done it before

333
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:44,720
and this is a particular example like we

334
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,079
teamed up with cern the particle

335
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,240
accelerator in geneva

336
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:50,560
and we ran a toronto version of day

337
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,920
hackathon at the same time

338
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,920
it's called the quantum futures

339
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,519
hackathon and we had

340
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,040
a really a lot of cool projects that

341
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:59,519
came out of that including

342
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,880
thomas and kelly who made the blockade

343
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:03,200
game that they were presenting earlier

344
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,200
today

345
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:07,600
another thing on the outreach side is

346
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,680
like moocs or massively open online

347
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:13,040
courses so peter is part of

348
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:14,640
the u of t and qsf like had an edx

349
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,640
course that is still accessible you can

350
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,160
check it out on this edx link it's about

351
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:20,720
quantum machine learning

352
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:21,439
it might be a bit dense for beginners

353
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,279
but like

354
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,120
once you kind of mastered the basics of

355
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:26,720
quantum computing that might be a really

356
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,560
interesting course to dive in and we

357
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:31,120
have the course material hosted on our

358
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,119
gitlab

359
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:36,079
and then i want to point out this paper

360
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:38,079
that is a follow-up paper

361
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:39,279
to the review paper that we wrote and

362
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:40,079
what they are pointing out is that

363
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:41,760
they're saying

364
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:43,279
we observe a lack of educational

365
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,720
resources

366
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:46,800
on quantum computing which is something

367
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,959
that i would disagree with because i

368
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:51,439
find there's quite a lot of resources

369
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:53,040
and desiree from australia she actually

370
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,959
has a list on github

371
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,639
that lists all the free and open

372
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:58,638
learning resources on quantum computing

373
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:59,279
and we're mirroring and co-hosting that

374
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:02,160
list

375
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:03,920
on the qsf website so if you're in need

376
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,639
of some learning resources go and check

377
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:07,839
that out

378
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:07,839
there's plenty of material

379
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,440
so i mentioned earlier that like mikhail

380
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:13,600
joined the co-team and like one thing

381
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,279
that he started is the quantum computing

382
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,200
mentorship program

383
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:19,360
um so for people that want to get into

384
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:21,279
the space but they might not

385
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:23,279
feel comfortable or they i don't know

386
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:24,880
feel like they're like too early on

387
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:26,800
that's a great program you can basically

388
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,320
join and you can work on a quantum

389
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:30,079
computing related project

390
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,760
and you get teamed up with an expert

391
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:33,519
from industry or academia and you're

392
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,519
going to work together for three months

393
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:37,279
so it's mostly going to be you working

394
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:38,079
but you have regular check-ins with the

395
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:39,519
expert

396
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:40,959
you can get feedback they might look

397
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:42,720
into your code and kind of help you

398
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:44,239
implement certain things

399
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,399
and the goal of that is to build a

400
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:48,399
community of quantum enthusiasts

401
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:50,560
and also providing a smooth and guided

402
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:52,639
entry to the community because again

403
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:54,719
in that paper they were pointing out

404
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:56,560
they did a survey of the community

405
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,639
and said it was very much focused on

406
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:00,000
like people with a phd in quantum info

407
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:01,360
or computer science

408
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,040
and so we would like to kind of break

409
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,519
that up a bit and like bring people in

410
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,760
from

411
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:07,360
various backgrounds so if you're

412
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:09,200
interested in that

413
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,959
i did not get to push that code and

414
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,560
deploy it before this talk but we're

415
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:14,560
going to do it before tomorrow

416
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:16,638
so the deadline opens up tomorrow and

417
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:18,560
goes till february 14th

418
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:20,800
so if you're interested or if you know

419
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:24,000
of people that might be interested

420
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,000
feel free to spread the news

421
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:28,240
and then we have the idea of a

422
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:30,000
decentralized kind of quantum conference

423
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,160
that was something that will brought up

424
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,000
the idea that like foster talks already

425
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:36,160
recorded and put online

426
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
but the idea would be to like not just

427
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:39,199
end it with foster talks but also have

428
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,880
people record

429
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:43,040
uh talks like that where they're kind of

430
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:44,880
like presenting their projects and like

431
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:46,399
showcasing or demoing it

432
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,160
um throughout the year and publishing

433
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:49,279
that on youtube on youtube so if you

434
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,199
happen to know

435
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:53,439
how to edit videos properly because i

436
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:54,959
don't and thomas doesn't either

437
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,639
we would love to talk to you and maybe

438
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:58,479
partner up and and work on

439
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:01,360
these qcon videos because i'd like to

440
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:03,920
look have them look great

441
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,560
um and then lastly the the last pillar

442
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,240
is

443
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:08,239
leveling the playing field so what we

444
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,440
mean with that is providing an objective

445
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:12,079
reference point

446
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,519
to evaluate both quantum hardware and

447
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:16,319
software

448
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:18,160
so the idea is building compiler and

449
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,600
simulator benchmarks

450
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:21,040
like this is an example from the

451
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,680
classical domain you can see like

452
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,599
different c

453
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:24,719
plus plus compilers ranked against each

454
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,639
other

455
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,720
the idea is that there's way too many

456
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:30,240
quantum simulators out there right now

457
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,560
and if you would want to work on a

458
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:34,880
project you would face the decision like

459
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:38,399
okay which of these simulators do i use

460
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:39,680
and that is a difficult question to

461
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:41,600
answer because

462
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:43,120
it depends on what kind of quantum

463
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,959
circuit you're trying to simulate if it

464
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,079
consists only of clifford gates

465
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:47,920
you might want to use a different

466
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:48,800
simulator that is particularly optimized

467
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:51,439
for that

468
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,880
if you want to paralyze it on a big aws

469
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,760
instance or if you want to run it on

470
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,120
gpus

471
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:57,120
those are all factors that are going to

472
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,079
influence which simulator you want to

473
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,160
use

474
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:02,079
and we would ideally like to give you

475
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,760
that like opportunity to kind of like

476
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:05,120
look it up and have like some central

477
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:07,519
point where you can see them all

478
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:09,360
ranked against each other in order to

479
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:11,519
make this sort of decision

480
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,959
so ultimately we would love to build

481
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:15,920
what we call a qsf

482
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:17,760
gym where you have certain standardized

483
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:19,680
data sets like those might be like

484
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,959
certain types of circuits and if you

485
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:23,680
build a compiler

486
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:24,000
you can test it on this standardized set

487
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,359
of

488
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,360
quantum circuits and you can measure the

489
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,639
performance against other compilers

490
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,399
so you can think of it as kind of like

491
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:32,480
the standardized data sets that

492
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:33,920
are out there in computer vision or just

493
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,360
in traditional machine learning like

494
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,800
mlist

495
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,800
and then again we would have like some

496
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,639
sort of public leaderboard that ranks

497
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:42,319
the various implementations and projects

498
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:44,480
against each other

499
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,320
so again we have that little duck down

500
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,040
here if you fancy helping us develop

501
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,600
this

502
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:51,120
uh reach out to us because um like we

503
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,880
have limited bandwidth we all have

504
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,079
limited bandwidth so like if you want to

505
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:57,920
spend a little bit of spare time

506
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:57,920
helping us with this that would be great

507
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:02,160
and then lastly in that pillar for the

508
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,759
open source project evaluation that i

509
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,759
was touching upon earlier

510
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:07,040
that is currently accessible on the qsf

511
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:09,120
website

512
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,800
and the idea here is to have evaluation

513
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,880
results for static analysis

514
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,920
things like code coverage of the various

515
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,759
projects

516
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:17,839
but also kind of a grading scheme for

517
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:19,279
the documentation

518
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:21,360
and the idea is to encourage best

519
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:22,959
practices and also help newcomers decide

520
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,600
which project should i be spending my

521
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:25,119
time on

522
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,279
like you probably don't want to join a

523
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:29,040
project that i don't know it takes three

524
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:30,240
months to get back to your pull request

525
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,599
or your issues

526
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,680
um and might also have shitty

527
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:36,800
documentation so we want to kind of like

528
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:37,199
um enable or like help projects to kind

529
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,800
of

530
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:40,560
be aware of their shortcomings and then

531
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:43,040
fix them um

532
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,680
so again here we need help to automate

533
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,439
this

534
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,800
uh right now it's very manual and

535
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,560
painful um

536
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,079
and there should be good ways of like

537
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:53,518
scripting this so if you're interested

538
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:56,399
in helping in that let us know

539
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:57,759
and then lastly um we are like we have

540
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:59,279
this thought and that's a very high

541
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:00,480
level thought we haven't like flashed

542
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:04,240
this out fully yet

543
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:05,520
to like create a bi-annual qsf price for

544
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,280
the best or well-made most

545
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,160
well-maintained quantum open source

546
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,839
project

547
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,679
and we would like to dedicate that to

548
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:13,039
peter and we ideally want to pull in

549
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:15,600
some partners

550
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:17,199
maybe some journals maybe some companies

551
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:19,359
from the software space and kind of

552
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:21,280
launch this and get this off the ground

553
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:22,399
and as i said we haven't fully fleshed

554
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:24,720
this out if you have ever

555
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:26,640
done something in this kind of way that

556
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,600
like awarding prices for software

557
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,360
projects

558
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:30,719
or anything related to that please reach

559
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,240
out to us and and

560
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:35,200
i don't know share your insights because

561
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:35,200
we haven't done it either

562
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:39,520
so lastly quick overview of the small

563
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:42,879
requests that we have

564
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:45,200
um tell us about uncracked challenges

565
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:47,039
related to quantum software if you know

566
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:49,280
how to get funding as an ngo

567
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:50,240
especially a software foundation please

568
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:52,639
reach out

569
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,919
if you know video editing we'd love to

570
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:57,919
collaborate for the

571
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:59,520
qcon 2020 idea tell your friends about

572
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:00,080
the mentorship program or sign up

573
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,559
yourself

574
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:04,159
if you're interested and then we need

575
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:06,639
help developing this

576
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,600
qosf gym for the compiler and simulator

577
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,320
benchmarks

578
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:11,439
as well as automating the project

579
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:13,600
evaluation

580
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,960
and if you have ever awarded prices for

581
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:17,520
software projects

582
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:19,200
you can switch out so if you want to get

583
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:21,200
involved

584
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:23,039
there's a become a supporter tab on the

585
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,720
website

586
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:26,480
basically what that means is that you're

587
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,160
going to be put on a mailing list

588
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,240
where we send out information like

589
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:31,039
foster or like hackathon events or

590
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,480
anything

591
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:34,080
related to the quantum open source

592
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:37,360
foundation

593
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:39,678
join our slack channel and

594
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:40,559
this is the end of my talk and uh like i

595
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:43,840
invite you to

596
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:46,240
check out our github and gitlab profile

597
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,959
and follow us on social media that's it

598
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:57,840
from me

599
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:57,840
thank you

600
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:11,840
it's okay

601
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,120
thank you it might be a bit off topic

602
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,919
but i'm just wondering if there is such

603
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,159
a thing

604
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:26,000
as in 3d there is the utah teapot and in

605
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:28,000
programming there is the hello world

606
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,840
that you write when you are a newcomer

607
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,360
to a field is there such a thing in

608
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:33,760
quantum computing with

609
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:35,600
like a hello world first step that you

610
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:37,840
could like um

611
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:39,199
devise and if not then it would be

612
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:42,480
desirable or

613
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:45,039
bad id just wondering this question

614
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:46,559
for everyone i guess yeah i would

615
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:48,720
probably answer it in a way that

616
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:51,280
there is hello world examples but they

617
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:53,200
are very specific to the particular

618
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:54,879
hardware that you're looking at so like

619
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,840
for example righty has their own hello

620
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:58,000
world example

621
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:59,280
d-wave has their own hello world example

622
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,120
there's actually a question on the

623
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,760
quantum computing stack exchange at some

624
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,439
point

625
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:05,760
like what's the hello world equivalent

626
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,880
for d-wave and i wrote a big answer to

627
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,520
it but like it's really hardware

628
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,200
dependent

629
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,639
and like even like software dependent

630
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:14,000
depending on which

631
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:18,840
tool or framework you choose

632
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:21,360
so that's the unfortunate thing anybody

633
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:35,840
else

634
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:35,840
there's one over there

635
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:40,000
uh one sort of comment and challenge

636
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:42,158
related to the hello world question

637
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,480
is um there are there are hello world

638
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:46,080
problems in the quantum computing space

639
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:47,919
but then there's sort of nothing after

640
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,960
that and then you design your own

641
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:50,159
algorithms so you

642
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,080
if you're getting into it you sort of

643
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:53,280
write the hello world you go like okay i

644
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:55,600
can make a circuit

645
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,879
and then step two is all right start

646
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,158
designing your own quantum algorithms

647
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,000
and quantum machine learning

648
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:01,280
and there's no like all right now that

649
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,280
you've written the hello world let's see

650
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:05,280
if we can add two plus two and

651
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:07,120
and sort of build up skills from there

652
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,799
and i think that's uh

653
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:10,399
a stage that might also be missing and

654
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:13,918
might actually be more critical

655
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:15,679
is that you sort of need a a guiding

656
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:17,440
a guiding track rather than just a jump

657
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:18,159
from like i have written this code and

658
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,240
it works

659
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:30,400
to i now have to design my own or

660
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:31,760
implement my own quantum algorithms

661
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,440
okay so if i understood correctly the

662
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:34,559
concern was that there's no good

663
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:37,919
intermediate

664
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:39,678
kind of level um materials there's

665
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:41,440
well at the beginning and maybe both at

666
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:45,200
the end but not and

667
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:46,720
i guess okay but any any other questions

668
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:48,880
i guess we have time for a lot one last

669
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:59,840
question

670
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:59,840
um okay so let's thank mark again

671
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,720
you
