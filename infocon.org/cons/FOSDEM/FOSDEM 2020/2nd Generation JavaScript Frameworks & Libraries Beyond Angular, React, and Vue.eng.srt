1
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:08,639
thank you very much for

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:10,400
coming to this talk um i want to talk

3
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:11,360
about a topic that i've heard very

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,759
little about

5
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:15,200
um the second generation of javascript

6
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:17,520
technologies and libraries that have

7
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,359
arisen over the past years and i want to

8
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,439
maybe first of all talk about what i

9
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:22,720
would mean by the first generation

10
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:24,480
and then introduce you to the second

11
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:26,400
generation and hopefully you'll

12
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,599
learn about some new technologies out

13
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:31,359
there

14
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:33,600
so um who i am um my name is here young

15
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:35,600
i work for oracle as a developer in

16
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,880
particular on open source projects

17
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,440
so for a long time i've worked on

18
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:41,680
netbeans um in apache i'm the

19
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:43,280
apache pmc chair for netbeans it's an

20
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,039
apache project now

21
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,280
i also work on something else called

22
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:49,440
oracle jet which is a front-end

23
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,559
toolkit for doing user interface

24
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,640
development

25
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:54,160
free open source and i've recently

26
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,239
written or put together a book of

27
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:59,599
interviews with developer advocates

28
00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:00,959
so it's about 780 pages long interviews

29
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,320
with people who are advocates for

30
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,760
different technologies and how they

31
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,040
ended up being that and

32
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,798
what their day looks like and the

33
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,680
ethical dilemmas of being a developer

34
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:10,159
advocate

35
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,520
if you would like to review this book um

36
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:12,000
let me know and i can get you a free

37
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:16,000
copy

38
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,960
for your blog or whatever it's out there

39
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,960
so to very quickly get to the point um

40
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,039
javascript's been around for a while

41
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,080
and one could talk about a first

42
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,080
generation

43
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,520
of frameworks and libraries haven't

44
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:30,640
having been developed at some

45
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:33,439
stage so first of all initially we had

46
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,479
solutions like jquery and mootools and

47
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:37,520
and dojo

48
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:39,679
and you know jquery these types of um

49
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:41,759
frameworks and libraries initially and

50
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:44,640
then maybe a second

51
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:46,720
sub generation here with backbone and

52
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,520
ember and knockout and angularjs and

53
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,439
more recently

54
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:52,000
all the discussion is basically about

55
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:53,919
whether to use angular or view or react

56
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,040
that's basically in terms of front end

57
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:59,200
that's the discussion

58
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:02,159
that you hear all the time now um

59
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:04,159
of course we know that this massive

60
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,840
proliferation of javascript libraries

61
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:07,040
and technologies is wonderful on the one

62
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,000
side because it shows that there's

63
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,239
innovation and there's new

64
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,760
ideas and so on but on the other side it

65
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:13,040
means um it's quite

66
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,640
quite a big problem to make the right

67
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,920
choices you know what is the right

68
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,599
choice to make

69
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:20,160
and so you spend some time learning

70
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:21,200
grunt um for your builds

71
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,560
and you're very happy with your

72
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,760
knowledge of grunt and then your

73
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,040
colleague tells you yes but you should

74
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,319
actually be doing gulp now

75
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,760
so then you spend some time learning

76
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:28,399
gulp and you're very comfortable with

77
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,640
gulp

78
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,239
and guess what brunch is apparently the

79
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,359
new gulp and in the meantime there's

80
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:35,760
something else again

81
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,400
and this constant churn is really very

82
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,879
specific

83
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,760
very typical to the javascript ecosystem

84
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:41,840
which simply

85
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,959
shows that it's it's a vibrant

86
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,239
constantly developing

87
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:47,840
ecosystem but um definitely presents

88
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:49,200
problems if you're creating something

89
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,800
more serious

90
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,640
not some hobby project it's a small

91
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,840
project project but something more

92
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:56,160
significant so that

93
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,760
i would say that the three key problems

94
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,760
are first of all churn

95
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:02,000
so this this constant technology change

96
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,440
that you have to constantly keep up with

97
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,959
and it's not on the level of that you

98
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,319
have to keep up with javascript but it's

99
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,080
that you have to keep up with all these

100
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,958
technologies this whole ecosystem around

101
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,120
it

102
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:13,120
and what you then also see developing is

103
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,200
the concept of custom stats

104
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,400
so of course if you use view you don't

105
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,640
just use view you

106
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,519
do seven things plus view and if you use

107
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,518
react you use

108
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:23,280
seven things plus react and angular as

109
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:23,840
well you know if you want a component

110
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,440
library

111
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,799
these kinds of solutions don't provide

112
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,319
them out of the box so you go somewhere

113
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:30,000
else for the component library and you

114
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:32,079
go somewhere else for the build system

115
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,159
and as soon as you have a problem and

116
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:36,400
you go online to stack overflow for

117
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:38,399
a solution it turns out it's a great

118
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,239
solution however you're not using the

119
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,040
two or three things that are specific to

120
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:42,799
the solution

121
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,640
on stack overflow you're using a whole

122
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:46,000
different stack so everyone has their

123
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,879
own custom stacks which

124
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,400
of course is not ideal and what you also

125
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:52,319
find is that people

126
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,599
are no longer javascript developers but

127
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:56,000
they're view developers or

128
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:57,599
angular developers or react developers i

129
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,080
mean that's crazy in a few years time

130
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:00,079
those

131
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,080
technologies won't be there and you

132
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:04,480
can't be that tightly coupled

133
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,840
to these solutions so you know these

134
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,480
statements here for the first time in

135
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,959
history

136
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,480
we have people identifying by framework

137
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:12,799
instead of language

138
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:15,359
and people identifying themselves with a

139
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:18,400
framework is a tragedy

140
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:21,199
this is what i would like to pose to you

141
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:22,719
and this becomes even more complicated

142
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:25,120
because over the past years

143
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,919
large enterprises have started using

144
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,240
javascript

145
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:30,960
as as a front-end solution so i come

146
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,880
from oracle but in ibm and microsoft

147
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:35,198
google you know you can you can really

148
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:37,040
see how serious javascript is

149
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:39,199
by the fact that the large vendors are

150
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,639
adopting it not as an experimental thing

151
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:44,080
or prototyping but

152
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:47,199
real creating real serious applications

153
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:48,479
for their business using javascript

154
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:51,040
which makes this problem all the more

155
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:52,639
complicated because in the enterprise

156
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,520
space it's not about what is cool and

157
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:55,680
what is new

158
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,039
it's about what is stable and reliable

159
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,120
and what what is still going to be

160
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,560
maintainable in a few years time

161
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,400
so then you aren't running after the

162
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,320
latest hype but you're running after

163
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,440
or trying to find something stable and

164
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,840
and reliable

165
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:09,440
so why are the enterprises now looking

166
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,719
or have been looking over the past years

167
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,719
at javascript

168
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,160
in particular because the browser is

169
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,320
everywhere i mean if there was a

170
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,160
competition between platforms

171
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:20,639
the browser platform is one it's on all

172
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,120
devices and javascript is built natively

173
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:23,600
into it

174
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,639
so it makes sense to natively use

175
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,560
javascript

176
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:28,320
rather than proprietary abstractions

177
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,039
that the larger vendors have developed

178
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,759
internally

179
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:33,199
but to use javascript directly and also

180
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:35,360
mobile development

181
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:36,800
and you know young developers coming

182
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:40,000
straight from colleges and so on

183
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,479
know javascript and so their skills have

184
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,880
a far

185
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:44,719
closer match with the javascript world

186
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,159
than some proprietary technology so

187
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,400
oracle has a bunch of

188
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,160
abstractions on top of javascript and

189
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,440
sap does and all of these different

190
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,120
organizations do

191
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,800
but it takes some time to learn those

192
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,319
things and plus

193
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,720
when a developer now comes for an

194
00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:01,120
interview at an organization

195
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,840
the organization isn't interviewing them

196
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,360
but the

197
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:05,119
the developer is interviewing the

198
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,039
company because there is so much work

199
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,479
as a developer you can go anywhere so

200
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:09,919
are you going to go somewhere

201
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:12,080
where there is a free open source

202
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:13,840
technology stack where your skills that

203
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,800
you pick up can be transferred to

204
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,318
somewhere else

205
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,080
or are you going to invest time learning

206
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:19,759
something very proprietary to what that

207
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:22,080
particular vendor is doing

208
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:24,160
so for that reason these organizations

209
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:27,280
simply to be able to attract

210
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,639
new developer staff are forced to move

211
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:31,119
into the open source

212
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:32,840
world to create these kinds of solutions

213
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,240
these kinds of steps that will attract

214
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:36,400
developers

215
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,080
so yes everyone knows basic javascript

216
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,599
in one way or another you know how deep

217
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,560
that knowledge is is a different

218
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,039
question

219
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,160
but um the enterprise likes javascript

220
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:47,120
definitely so

221
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:49,120
for example um you know to give very

222
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,360
simple examples as a starting point

223
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,039
oracle sap microsoft are all doing

224
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,960
things on the front end with javascript

225
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:56,880
in some cases node on the back end but

226
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,318
it could be java could be whatever but

227
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:01,120
the front end definitely

228
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:02,639
is very big in javascript in in the

229
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,479
large vendor space so what kinds of

230
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:06,080
applications are they creating so

231
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:07,758
in the case of mobile i mean these are

232
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,680
logistics health care

233
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:10,800
type applications but i have very

234
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,680
specific requirements

235
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,880
that are not common outside the um the

236
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,880
large vendor space

237
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,880
so for example the ability to translate

238
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,520
strings so that's a russian app on the

239
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,159
end there

240
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:23,758
so some localization solution you don't

241
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,639
want every single department in your

242
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:27,039
large vendor

243
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:28,840
figuring out localization themselves and

244
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:30,240
also these large vendors have to follow

245
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:32,799
specifications

246
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,160
so the question is um you know keeping

247
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,960
up with specifications

248
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:38,800
it's the question of working out as a

249
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,719
solution around localization

250
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,080
it's thinking about accessibility as

251
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,000
well so

252
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:46,080
there's this accessibility requirements

253
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,280
that just large vendors have to meet

254
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:49,840
and so all of these kind of enterprise

255
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,719
level

256
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:54,159
requirements have to be met somehow and

257
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,479
aren't met out of the box

258
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:58,160
by these first generation libraries and

259
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:58,960
frameworks they don't provide these

260
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,479
kinds of

261
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,719
higher level features these kinds of

262
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:04,159
enterprise features including graphs and

263
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,720
charts and other components

264
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:08,000
so that's a real problem these kinds of

265
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,560
very

266
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,919
interactive very graphic very ui

267
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,720
oriented applications are

268
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:16,240
typically created a lot in the in the

269
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,479
large vendor space as well

270
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,919
looking like this or a mobile app so

271
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:23,360
these are all kind of in the

272
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:25,280
logistics healthcare finance worlds

273
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,879
is where these are used now here are

274
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,719
some of the typical requirements so

275
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,319
one thing is you find that the people

276
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,680
working on these on these applications

277
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:33,200
at the large vendors are coming from

278
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,440
other technologies

279
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,399
from java or from.net or from somewhere

280
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,760
else and suddenly

281
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:40,000
they're using javascript for the first

282
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,919
time so this is whole transition

283
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
to the javascript world meaning that

284
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:47,199
there has to be this low threshold

285
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,200
entry point into creating these ui's

286
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,720
they have to be out of the box solutions

287
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,920
you don't want everyone in your

288
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,360
organization or you don't want

289
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,360
organizations within your company all

290
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,880
figuring out on their own what

291
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,640
stack they should be using there needs

292
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,680
to be a standardization at least across

293
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,199
a company

294
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,479
so comprehensiveness out to nan

295
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,440
accessibility and standards in

296
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,200
particular and

297
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,440
in terms of standards a w3c web

298
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:09,839
component standard for reusability

299
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,480
the other thing you find which is so um

300
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:12,320
wonderful

301
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,680
and and and fun on the one hand but

302
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,360
problematic on the other

303
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:18,160
is you find a wonderful new library

304
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:20,000
online you start using it

305
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:22,160
and you can do the hello world scenario

306
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,920
that's in the documentation on the site

307
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:26,000
you want to get one step further and you

308
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,439
can't and then you contact the amazing

309
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,959
person who created the library and they

310
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,000
say yes i was doing that last week i'm

311
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:31,279
doing something else now

312
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,519
hey it's open source why don't you

313
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:34,959
contribute documentation you know and

314
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:36,640
and that's all very nice but in the

315
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:37,839
enterprise space it's very problematic

316
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:40,160
because you want stability and

317
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:42,480
reliability and so on

318
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,600
so aside from these organizations

319
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,920
there's a whole bunch of other ones that

320
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:48,560
might surprise you

321
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,279
so there's these ones but there's also

322
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:53,119
paypal

323
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:55,200
walmart financial times uber airbnb

324
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:57,760
because nowadays every organization is

325
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:00,720
an i.t organization

326
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:01,120
so if i show you some examples of this

327
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:05,839
so

328
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:05,839
um kraken ah you can see my screen

329
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:19,839
mid flow right display

330
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:35,200
um

331
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:35,200
okay there we go

332
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:45,200
great so what we see here is something

333
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:47,360
called kraken.js

334
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:49,120
and look in the top right that's paypal

335
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:51,040
so paypal has developed an internal

336
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,320
technology stack that they're using

337
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:55,839
and they've open-sourced it it's on

338
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:59,200
github who else is on github

339
00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:00,720
uber uber is an it organization uber is

340
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,160
on github their technology stack that

341
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,720
they use for their

342
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:06,079
uis and other parts of their application

343
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:09,839
is online

344
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:12,839
airbnb is on github

345
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:14,240
and walmart is not a shop it's an i.t

346
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:16,320
organization

347
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,640
a financial times not a new not a

348
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:20,720
newspaper it's an idea organization

349
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,680
all these different organizations are it

350
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,000
organizations

351
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,279
and many of them have online presences

352
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,880
where they make available their

353
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:29,839
technology stack for one reason or

354
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,839
another

355
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,760
so this is the key tip i want to bring

356
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,760
across

357
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:41,920
is that a lot of the research in this

358
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,839
area a lot of standardization in this

359
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:46,719
area within organizations

360
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:47,120
the result of that is on github and you

361
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:50,160
can

362
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:51,360
take a look at that so you've seen some

363
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,199
of these

364
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,200
now here are some characteristics of the

365
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:57,600
second generation so i'll call this

366
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:59,200
the second generation a gathering of the

367
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,320
different parts that are available from

368
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,639
the first generation

369
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:04,240
and making a comprehensive solution out

370
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:06,560
of it so first of all

371
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,519
not cool these are not the latest

372
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,599
cutting edge

373
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:11,279
libraries and frameworks and so on but

374
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,920
they're stable which is much more

375
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:13,519
important

376
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,279
in this kind of environment and the

377
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:16,639
other point is they're not frameworks

378
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:19,279
but they're toolkits

379
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:20,639
and toolkit kind of implies flexibility

380
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:22,000
and modularity

381
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:23,680
and something that can be extended

382
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,800
because we know the javascript ecosystem

383
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,479
is changing all the time and new

384
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:29,599
solutions are coming out all the time

385
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:31,200
so the most important thing um to think

386
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,079
about is the architecture of an

387
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,320
application

388
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:35,680
since the stack is going to change to

389
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,480
make it as loosely structured as

390
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,239
possible

391
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,680
so that you can extend it and add and

392
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,440
remove from it and

393
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:43,040
the following of standards such as the

394
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:45,040
web component specification

395
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:47,279
such as accessibility guidelines and so

396
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,279
on

397
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:52,319
the key questions so before you rush off

398
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:55,200
to github and you find

399
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:56,800
some random cool stack key questions two

400
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,600
key questions to ask yourself first of

401
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,839
all is

402
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,600
what does it mean for an organization to

403
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:03,600
put their stack on github

404
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,720
it could mean that we don't care about

405
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,040
it anymore

406
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,920
and we're going to pretend that we care

407
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,599
about the community

408
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:11,199
so we're going to put it on github and

409
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,320
say hey it's there and please start

410
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,160
using it

411
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,600
um it could be so it could be a sign

412
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,519
that the company behind it

413
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,200
doesn't care that much about the

414
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:20,480
technology stack so you need to really

415
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,920
evaluate

416
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,839
you can and you can see that on github

417
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:25,360
you can see what pull requests are

418
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:27,279
coming in how the community is

419
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,480
operating who is checking it i mean

420
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:29,920
that's the wonderful thing about github

421
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:32,480
it's all transparent

422
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:33,599
so that's that's kind of the the the

423
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,040
sort of side effect

424
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,519
for these organizations they can't

425
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:38,719
pretend that that they're contributing

426
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:40,000
to this

427
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,160
because you can all see it it's all on

428
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,079
github that's really wonderful about it

429
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:45,839
and secondly before you pick one of

430
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:48,000
these stacks think about

431
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:49,279
whether the business that that's that

432
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,959
stack was created for

433
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:53,040
is comparable to the business that

434
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:55,119
you're doing so for example ing

435
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,800
big bank they have their technology

436
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,399
stack on github

437
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:00,399
you should ask yourself is my business

438
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:02,240
comparable to what ing is doing am i

439
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:04,480
also in the financial world or

440
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:06,320
in if i'm using uber's solution is what

441
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:09,040
i'm doing comparable to uber so

442
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:10,800
try and map your requirements to what

443
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,760
these organizations are doing and based

444
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,560
on that

445
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:15,439
evaluate their stacks so in the case of

446
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,760
oracle

447
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:19,360
here is an example so here is a this is

448
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,480
a completely free open source front-end

449
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,639
stack you can see the

450
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,680
the server is empty it can be anything

451
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:26,480
on the back end

452
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:27,760
data coming from anywhere and um

453
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:30,639
everything is on the client

454
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:31,120
so it's a pure client solution and it's

455
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:34,079
all

456
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,639
free open source stuff so um knockout is

457
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:36,638
in there

458
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:38,959
it's not quite cool no it's not cool but

459
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:40,480
it's stable and it's got documentation

460
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:42,560
and there's lots of things on stack

461
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:44,480
overflow knockouts in there

462
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:46,160
require is in there it's required yeah

463
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:48,480
it's cool no but it's stable

464
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,920
so these kinds of considerations make

465
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:53,040
sense in

466
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:54,000
this kind of environment so in oracle's

467
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:56,079
case these kinds

468
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,079
these are the typical libraries these

469
00:14:56,079 --> 00:15:00,880
are the standard libraries that every

470
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:02,079
oracle front-end application now has so

471
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:06,160
it makes use of

472
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:07,839
um of jquery which is now um

473
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:09,839
being replaced by web components so it's

474
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:13,760
a pure web component-based solution

475
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:15,199
required js for modularity and knockout

476
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,880
and optionally typescript either

477
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:19,359
typescript or javascript

478
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:20,079
cordova to get it onto the app stores

479
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,880
and

480
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:22,880
optionally webpack

481
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:27,839
so if we take a look

482
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:33,120
well we'll take a look at the end

483
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,880
here are the typical enterprise

484
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:37,600
requirements for these large vendors

485
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:38,959
so stability proven tool set that's

486
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,240
really critical

487
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:41,839
responsive design you don't want

488
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,800
everyone in your organization figuring

489
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:44,720
out

490
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:46,719
how to do responsive design um

491
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,680
accessibility internationalization data

492
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,360
visualization

493
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:51,120
you have concerns about security about

494
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,880
performance standards

495
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,560
you want to empower business users so

496
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:56,480
not only a code oriented

497
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:57,920
technology stack but also a wysiwyg

498
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,920
solution in the browser

499
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:02,399
and documentation and support very

500
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,399
important

501
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,320
and in that way new young developers can

502
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,000
be attracted

503
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,920
to these kinds of organizations where

504
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,600
traditionally they would stay far away

505
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:13,199
from them especially now

506
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,440
um where you can go anywhere and

507
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:18,479
everyone is working with

508
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:20,240
with these solutions open source so

509
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,800
the key challenge that i would want to

510
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,839
leave you with is maybe stop comparing

511
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:27,519
angular react

512
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:30,560

airbnb oracle microsoft

514
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:36,160
find the um find on github the

515
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:37,519
stacks that plus places match your

516
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,880
requirements

517
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:40,399
make sure that they are that they are

518
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,759
there that they are alive and well and

519
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:43,199
actually being

520
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:45,199
being further developed in the digital

521
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:48,560
community around it and so on

522
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:51,279
um and based on that make those choices

523
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:53,199
um the second point is we need to i

524
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:55,439
think educate our community

525
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:57,279
about the pitfalls of being so closely

526
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,519
focused on the first generation

527
00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:00,880
because these organizations even though

528
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:02,560
like these large vendors even though

529
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,360
they have taken the second generation

530
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,039
approach

531
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,720
they're having a hard time attracting

532
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:08,640
new developers anyway

533
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:10,720
because in case of oracle for example

534
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,880
they're knocked out and required your ss

535
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:14,319
adopted for completely valid reasons

536
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,839
but when a developer comes for an

537
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:16,720
interview and says greg you're doing

538
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:19,359
javascript

539
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:21,679
but i'm a view developer or i'm a react

540
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:24,799
developer or whatever so

541
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:27,360
i would challenge us to educate

542
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:28,879
our communities that that this is a

543
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:31,039
dangerous approach

544
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:32,880
and that orientating and identifying

545
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:33,919
yourself that closely with a particular

546
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:37,520
framework for libraries

547
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:38,960
is not sustainable so investigate second

548
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:41,360
generation technologies

549
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,640
and actively contribute to them as well

550
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,799
find that stack that is

551
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:46,000
closest to your requirements and

552
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:47,760
actively contribute to it

553
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,120
to actually test whether your

554
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,879
organization will accept your pull

555
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:53,360
requests and enable you to actually

556
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:56,559
contribute

557
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:57,120
to put it into a picture are you focused

558
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:59,918
on hype

559
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:01,039
or on health already using the latest

560
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:03,039
coolest thing

561
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:06,080
or are they using things that are stable

562
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:09,600
and reliable and that will still be

563
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:09,600
maintainable in a few years time

564
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:15,840
that's it thank you very much

565
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:25,760
you
