1
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:10,320
[Applause]

2
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,639
sure

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,080
let's see how it goes it's been charging

4
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:17,359
great go team

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:19,279
um i'm gonna be reading or describing

6
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:21,279
some of the slides in case anyone has

7
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:22,080
vision problems or is later watching a

8
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:23,680
video

9
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,038
uh and having trouble seeing what's on

10
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,160
the screen or unable to see what's on

11
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:28,640
the screen

12
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,160
uh i would also request that people

13
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,480
don't interrupt me

14
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,320
during the talk uh there'll be time at

15
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:38,078
the end for questions

16
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:40,879
um so let's make a start

17
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:42,480
um i wanna briefly mention why we're

18
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:45,280
talking about this when i

19
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,559
pitched this talk the conversation we

20
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:49,280
were having

21
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:50,959
around internet of things devices was

22
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,399
very different than the one we're having

23
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:55,600
today

24
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:58,480
this is because there has been a lot of

25
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,520
uh there have been a number of cases of

26
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,919
people

27
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,199
uh having their privacy and security

28
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,000
violated

29
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:07,520
by iot especially surveillance devices

30
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,640
in their homes

31
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:12,960
um however most of these comments are

32
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,799
focused on the individual

33
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:17,280
they're thinking about your family or

34
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:17,920
yourself and i think we really need to

35
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,159
look at

36
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,680
how these things are impacting society

37
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,280
at a larger scale

38
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,759
and how they're impacting people who are

39
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,759
different from us

40
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:29,439
so i'd like to start by talking a little

41
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:32,799
bit about myself

42
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:33,119
i work in free software as we said this

43
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,159
is

44
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:36,560
a screenshot of the gnome foundation of

45
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:38,960
the

46
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,680
gnome desktop environment it's pretty

47
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,600
cool

48
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,040
i assume many of you use it at least i

49
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,039
hope you do

50
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,079
and i'm a fan i think it's a great

51
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,439
project

52
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:51,439
in addition to working in foss i also do

53
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:54,000
a lot of other things

54
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:55,279
i'm on the osi board i'm a member of the

55
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,159
debian project

56
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,600
i volunteer for the conservancy i donate

57
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:01,840
to organizations

58
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:04,079
like public labs that are working on

59
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:07,119
free and open source software projects

60
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:08,239
and developing tools that can be used by

61
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:11,840
people to create

62
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:15,040
social and environmental change uh

63
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:17,120
so and in addition to all of that

64
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:19,280
most of my friends are people i know

65
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:22,480
from free software

66
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,440
so in what little time i have left i

67
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,760
like to

68
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,280
not think about technology which isn't

69
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,799
actually true because i spend

70
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,640
most of my time in addition to that

71
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,319
thinking about technology and ethics and

72
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,799
societal impact

73
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:36,238
um but i like to sometimes think that i

74
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,239
do other things

75
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:40,959
i like to hang out with my dog and my

76
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:43,360
cat this is a rare photo of them

77
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:46,560
cuddling me that is the dog shiloh and

78
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:49,840
the cat bash they are both wonderful

79
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,640
i also really like to bake i bake

80
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,519
basically

81
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:55,599
everything i can in this photo in the

82
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:59,360
slide you can see a cake i made

83
00:02:55,599 --> 00:03:02,319
there are some american biscuits

84
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,680
muffins i made some queen among that

85
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:05,440
didn't quite work the first time but

86
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,080
it's a lot better now

87
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,560
and pancakes which aren't necessarily

88
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:12,480
baked

89
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:14,480
but are still good and kind of count

90
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,760
specifically most of the baking because

91
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:19,760
i work from home now

92
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:23,120
goes to my roommates i have three

93
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:25,120
amazing roommates i've lived with two of

94
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,640
them for about seven years now

95
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,440
we have a really good relationship and

96
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:31,760
we get along well which is why

97
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:34,400
um and we were in boston which is why

98
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,920
when they bought a house in providence

99
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,080
it actually made a lot of sense for me

100
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,958
to go with them because living together

101
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,080
was so

102
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:43,760
lovely um so we have

103
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,080
one other roommate who moved into the

104
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:49,599
apartment in early september

105
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,720
bean is a baby not my baby but still a

106
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:53,119
baby

107
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,879
she's as of right now eight months old

108
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,519
as of a few days ago

109
00:03:54,879 --> 00:04:00,560
and that's very exciting um it's really

110
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:02,000
exciting because bean was born at 24

111
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,560
weeks

112
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,959
to provide a little context for that in

113
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:12,239
the u.s and in many places

114
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:15,760
if a child is born at less than 24 weeks

115
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:19,040
they aren't given um life-saving

116
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:22,719
extreme medical uh uh

117
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:24,320
interventions um the youngest child

118
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,960
that was born that was known to survive

119
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:28,800
was at 21 weeks

120
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,080
this is not a picture of being this is a

121
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:34,080
26 year old

122
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:37,120
uh 26 20 26 week

123
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:38,719
baby that i found on the internet so

124
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,120
if you're putting pictures of your

125
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:43,120
sonograms and fetuses and babies on the

126
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,880
internet i think that's a little weird

127
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,560
um but it's cool if that's what you're

128
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,199
into that's just you know they can't

129
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,400
consent

130
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:51,199
to having a photo on the internet yet um

131
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,560
a little

132
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:56,000
that's too many slides another note is

133
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,720
40 weeks is considered full

134
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,600
term um so bean was about halfway

135
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,639
finished

136
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:06,000
the process of becoming like

137
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:08,479
a person who could survive in the world

138
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,400
another way so this means that this

139
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:13,440
child is a special needs

140
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:17,039
child she has a lot uh

141
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:20,080
has had a lot of compensations

142
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:23,280
interventions uh and medical

143
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:27,758
appointments to make it so she can be

144
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:30,638
okay um two of us work from home

145
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:32,320
uh which is really great because like i

146
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:34,800
said even though she's not

147
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:37,120
biologically related to me i i help a

148
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,960
lot and i'm very attached to this child

149
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:41,120
she's puked on me twice and i still like

150
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,120
her

151
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,919
so we're able to provide a lot of the

152
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:47,758
support and help her

153
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:49,120
do things and keep an eye on her because

154
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:52,240
when you have a special needs

155
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:54,080
child a lot of nurseries and day care

156
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,400
centers won't take them

157
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:57,758
because of how much care they need and

158
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,919
also it's a bad idea

159
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:01,360
because many of them are

160
00:05:58,919 --> 00:06:02,960
immunosuppressed and their immune

161
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,960
systems are especially weak so they

162
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,479
can't be around other children

163
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,080
the number of times bean has left the

164
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:10,400
house with

165
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:12,080
for not going to the doctor is i think

166
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:15,440
three or four times

167
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:17,680
um since she came home

168
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,479
one of the things she had when she came

169
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,759
home

170
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:22,479
was an oxygen tank this is a picture of

171
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:25,919
a dog

172
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:29,599
with an oxygen tube up its nose

173
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:31,680
when people are given are on oxygen they

174
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:34,000
have a thing called a cannula

175
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,919
that goes to their nose i called it a

176
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,319
cannoli for a really long time because i

177
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:40,479
couldn't remember the word cannula

178
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:42,880
and i practiced it for this talk

179
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:46,318
actually

180
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:48,639
so bean was on oxygen and what that

181
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:51,680
means is we had this big machine

182
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:53,840
that took air and converted it from

183
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,280
like what we're generally breathing to a

184
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:57,440
much purer oxygen

185
00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:00,000
level and then that was given to the

186
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,560
baby she additionally had connected to

187
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,280
her

188
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,960
a big box with a bunch of sensors that

189
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,880
let us know things like her heart rate

190
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:09,198
and her blood oxygen level

191
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:10,960
from one sense this is actually really

192
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:12,080
convenient because if there's a problem

193
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,719
with the child

194
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:16,000
then you know because it starts beeping

195
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:19,199
but it also starts beeping

196
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:22,400
all the time um

197
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:25,440
therefore going outside is a really big

198
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,239
deal um leaving being alone and actually

199
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,479
even being

200
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:30,199
alone with her is a big deal because

201
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:31,599
you're taking on a much greater

202
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:35,280
responsibility

203
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:37,520
than you would with a regular child

204
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,638
because of things like it's possible

205
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,560
that her little

206
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:41,919
poorly developed lungs would stop

207
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,520
working

208
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:44,960
and that she would need to be rushed to

209
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:48,560
a hospital

210
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:52,080
that is not an uncommon thing so

211
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:53,039
going outside we use oxygen tanks so in

212
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:56,240
the house we had

213
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:57,360
a bunch of oxygen tanks and taking her

214
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,400
outside would mean

215
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:03,599
disconnecting her from the

216
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:04,318
uh the oxygen concentrator connecting

217
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:07,520
her

218
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:09,440
to an oxygen tank putting the oxygen

219
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:11,039
tank in the special oxygen tank bag that

220
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,560
you would carry on your shoulder

221
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:14,878
carrying the baby and carrying the

222
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,720
sensor this means you can't carry a lot

223
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:18,639
of other stuff

224
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,639
now i'm going to describe one of my

225
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:22,240
worst nightmares for when i was alone

226
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:26,160
with her

227
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:28,960
the doorbell ringing so

228
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:31,440
we live on the second floor and if the

229
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:34,640
doorbell rings see iot it's coming up

230
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:36,958
um if the doorbell rings that means

231
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:39,519
somebody has to go downstairs

232
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:40,000
uh and answer it and if you're alone

233
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,959
that means

234
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,919
either leaving the baby alone and i

235
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:45,518
don't know

236
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:47,839
i don't actually know like at what age

237
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:48,720
you can like go downstairs without the

238
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:50,399
kid but i'm

239
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:53,040
really scared of killing my roommate's

240
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:54,320
child so i definitely like carry her

241
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:57,680
around the house

242
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:59,360
um when i am alone uh so

243
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:01,120
answering like something as simple as

244
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:03,279
answering the door would mean

245
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:05,200
connecting her to this oxygen tank

246
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:06,320
taking the sensor taking the baby taking

247
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:09,519
the oxygen tank

248
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:11,279
going downstairs and opening the door

249
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:13,920
so i think things like tech could

250
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:16,480
probably help us a lot and make a really

251
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:18,319
big difference in our lives i

252
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,360
specifically want to talk about smart

253
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,440
doorbells

254
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,560
it would be great smart dollar bills are

255
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:25,600
so cool

256
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:27,839
um ever since uh there's an episode of

257
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,760
the x-files in season one i think

258
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:31,279
um where there's this guy who has this

259
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,439
fully automated house

260
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:34,399
that's actually evil but other than the

261
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,519
evil part

262
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:40,640
i was like that's so cool i want one

263
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:42,399
um also i've seen a lot of horror movies

264
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:44,240
so i'm a little paranoid about answering

265
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:45,120
the door when i don't know who's behind

266
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,640
it

267
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,640
because it could always be someone

268
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:50,399
insidious

269
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:52,160
therefore the idea of a smart doorbell

270
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:53,920
is great and especially for us

271
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,839
we could see who was there so we would

272
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,279
know if it was an encyclopedia salesman

273
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:59,600
if those still exist

274
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:01,279
um but we would also be able to like see

275
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,399
how we would need to respond could we

276
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:05,519
open a window and yell

277
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:07,519
would we need to go down um so there's

278
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:12,000
there's a little more space

279
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:12,000
to feel safer in our decision making

280
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,800
so the conversations we're going to be

281
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:19,680
having for the rest of our time together

282
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:23,040
are not necessarily about tech they're

283
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:25,359
about the role tech plays in our lives

284
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:27,279
um specifically we're going to be

285
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:29,680
talking about smart doorbells smart

286
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:30,560
locks and in general home surveillance

287
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,719
devices

288
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,920
and what that looks like in practice how

289
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,920
that affects you

290
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:39,120
but also how it affects the people in

291
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:42,000
your lives and your neighbors

292
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:43,200
this is not a dog but i loved this photo

293
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,760
so much

294
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,440
because it is a horse with a beware of

295
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:50,640
dog sign on it

296
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:51,440
um i think home surveillance devices are

297
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:55,040
like

298
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:58,720
kind of creepy and really terrible

299
00:10:55,040 --> 00:11:01,680
um there have been numerous cases of

300
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:05,360
things happening with them

301
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:07,279
that are not good i think one of the

302
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:10,880
most well-known ones

303
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:12,959
is when a camera was hacked into that

304
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:14,480
was set up in a child's room

305
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:16,160
we're not going to get into right now

306
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,399
how creepy it is that the child's

307
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:20,880
parents put a camera in their room

308
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:22,240
though i have heard arguments that i

309
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:25,519
could understand were compelling

310
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:26,720
why one might do so um and that was

311
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:28,560
hacked into

312
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,079
and so what happened was somebody was

313
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:33,119
talking to the girl

314
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:35,040
uh trying to make her do things uh and

315
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:37,519
using really inflammatory

316
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,319
uncomfortable and offensive language to

317
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:41,440
her

318
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:45,040
um and that's really scary and that's

319
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:48,160
really scary for parents

320
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:49,199
so there's that kind of implication that

321
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,959
it has

322
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:53,360
but there are also ways that it affects

323
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:55,680
the people around you

324
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,279
one of these is i don't know how many of

325
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,680
you saw the ring commercial that they

326
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:00,800
made

327
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:02,560
about halloween where they used video

328
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:05,359
from cameras

329
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:06,560
that were recording trick-or-treaters a

330
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:09,440
lot of this

331
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:10,160
is coming from weird licensing

332
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,240
agreements

333
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:14,800
that come with these devices that

334
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,320
require you to allow them access to some

335
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,719
of the footage

336
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,519
as an aside generally this footage is

337
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,519
stored

338
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:23,279
but it's not stored like on a server

339
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:25,600
that you have in your home

340
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:27,120
it's being stored by a third party um

341
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,279
and as we know

342
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:31,120
like there the cloud is just other

343
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:32,800
people's computers

344
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,720
so you're making a decision about

345
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,959
trusting these actors

346
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,000
who have financial and commercial

347
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:41,599
interests

348
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:43,279
in exploiting you to use this like very

349
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:46,880
personal information

350
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:46,880
uh and hope for the best

351
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:52,239
right one of the things they're pitching

352
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:55,760
is creating a new neighborhood watch

353
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:58,079
right um the neighborhood watch

354
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:59,600
is when people in a community take turns

355
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:02,000
keeping an eye on things

356
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:03,839
to make sure nothing bad happens but

357
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,399
when you digitize that

358
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:07,920
you're creating a much broader scale of

359
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:09,440
what's being recorded

360
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:11,199
um and you're recording things you're

361
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:15,360
not just noticing things

362
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:18,639
right part of this uh to to encourage

363
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:20,160
this development um we see things like

364
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:21,680
something called the neighbors app or

365
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:24,800
the neighborhood app i forget

366
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,800
i'm sorry um

367
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:30,959
which allows you to make reports

368
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,839
to people in your neighborhood who also

369
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:34,719
have the app and ideally also have ring

370
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:40,480
devices

371
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:43,839
this allows and creates a higher

372
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:45,680
tension neighborhood but it also creates

373
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:47,600
in general more monitoring

374
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:49,120
and these sorts of things lead to

375
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:52,320
chilling effects

376
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:55,040
um something i'm really interested in as

377
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:57,680
like this aside is these ideas of benign

378
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:58,880
acts of rebellion especially among

379
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:02,079
teenagers

380
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:06,000
we have these cultural narratives very

381
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:07,680
focused on things like sneaking out at

382
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,160
night or sneaking in too

383
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,680
late right there's one of the things

384
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,880
that circulates around the internet

385
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:15,279
every christmas

386
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:17,279
is about a family that teaches people

387
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:19,519
that teaches their children

388
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:20,639
to leave people presents around the

389
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:23,680
holidays

390
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:25,199
um and now doing that is suddenly a

391
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:28,000
thing you can't do

392
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:29,439
without people knowing who's doing it

393
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,480
and that might seem a little

394
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:34,240
silly but one of the things we're doing

395
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,160
is we're creating a generation and

396
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:38,000
future generations of people

397
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:39,279
who won't have access to those

398
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,920
experiences

399
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:42,560
won't understand them and in general

400
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,319
we'll be

401
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:47,279
much more used to being tightly

402
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:49,760
controlled and monitored at all times

403
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:51,199
and once something is set as a precedent

404
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:53,199
it is a lot easier

405
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:55,040
for other people to follow through on

406
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:57,040
that precedent in the future

407
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:58,800
it creates a group of people who are

408
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,680
complacent with the idea of being

409
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:02,079
monitored

410
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:03,359
and with the idea of that not just be of

411
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:06,479
not just being monitored

412
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:08,399
but that being recorded right

413
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,560
so there are these minor chilling

414
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:11,600
effects but also knowing you're being

415
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,359
recorded

416
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,760
does discourage people from taking

417
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:19,040
actions and this isn't just like taking

418
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:21,040
bad actions and being bad actors and we

419
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:22,079
can see how cctv closed circuit

420
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,920
television

421
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:25,279
is really effective in keeping people

422
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:28,479
from like

423
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:32,560
committing crimes in stores um

424
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:35,199
but also it does like it does um

425
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:38,239
discourage things that are benign or

426
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:39,839
things that are benevolent and good

427
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,680
something else is there are police

428
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:44,560
partnerships right there

429
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:45,040
are amazon with the ring device is

430
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:48,479
really

431
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:50,880
encouraging police partnerships

432
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,560
this includes police going around

433
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:55,839
neighborhoods and encouraging the

434
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:58,000
adoption of ring devices

435
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:58,880
them offering discounts for people who

436
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,440
purchase

437
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:04,079
in connection with the police force or

438
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:08,240
law enforcement

439
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:10,160
so like financial incentives um and

440
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:12,399
they're also police forces law

441
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:16,719
enforcement organizations

442
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:19,600
are being offered information

443
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:21,600
that they're not supposed to be given

444
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,920
and some of that information

445
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:26,800
a is things that you say you're not that

446
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:28,959
they say they're not going to share

447
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,399
one example of this is during their

448
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:32,880
sales pitch

449
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:35,839
during the ring sales pitch there's

450
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:39,839
usually included

451
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:42,399
an example a demonstration or a slide

452
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:44,079
that gives a sample of what it looks

453
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:44,959
like in the neighborhood so it alerts

454
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:47,359
the police

455
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:49,599
which neighborhoods having devices so

456
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:51,759
before they've even bought in

457
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,360
to the idea like before they even bought

458
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:55,759
in financially or

459
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,720
psychologically to the idea that they

460
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:59,759
now have an

461
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:01,120
investment uh in what's going on and

462
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:03,279
that they deserve the right to the

463
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:06,240
knowledge of who is doing what

464
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:07,919
like they're given like a pre-example of

465
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,520
what's happening

466
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:11,839
one of the things that comes out of this

467
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:13,039
is false arrests an increase in false

468
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:16,240
arrests

469
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:18,480
there's at least one case of a black man

470
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:20,559
in the united states who was arrested

471
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:23,360
because he was falsely identified

472
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:24,000
from ring footage uh and that's really

473
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:26,000
scary

474
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,520
right so one of the things is that

475
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,160
people in general

476
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:32,080
are much worse at recognizing people

477
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:35,200
from other races than themselves

478
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:36,639
or people from races outside of the

479
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:39,919
communities they grew up

480
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:41,360
in so in general when you're trying to

481
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:44,320
connect things you're going to have a

482
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:46,399
harder time making visual recognition

483
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:48,240
but you're also going to have problems

484
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,160
with facial surveillance

485
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,520
i would say don't or facial recognition

486
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,640
now i would say don't even get me

487
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:55,840
started on it

488
00:17:52,640 --> 00:18:00,080
but i really want to talk about it

489
00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:02,399
um there are lots of recorded problems

490
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,120
uh that come with especially fake facial

491
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,320
recognition

492
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:08,719
software um one of the most common

493
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,600
things is that it's bad at recognizing

494
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,160
people

495
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:13,678
from i'm going to say minority groups

496
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,120
but they're not actually minorities

497
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:15,919
especially when you look at a global

498
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,678
scale

499
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:19,919
what they really are are people who

500
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:22,320
don't look like the majority of the

501
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:22,880
developers working on these technologies

502
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:26,000
and this

503
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:29,760
software um kind of

504
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:33,280
one of the classic examples of this is

505
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:36,559
uh for a while the

506
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:41,039
uh google's image recognition software

507
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:44,320
was identifying black people as gorillas

508
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:46,480
and and the last i heard

509
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:48,159
attempts to fix it what they did was

510
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,200
they actually just instead of fixing it

511
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:52,320
removed

512
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:55,440
the ability to identify gorillas uh

513
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:58,159
from their image recognition software

514
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:59,840
there are also problems recognizing

515
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:03,679
women

516
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:03,678
indigenous and other people of color

517
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:08,399
trans people have a lot of problems with

518
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:10,640
different types of image recognition

519
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:12,799
especially when they're trying to divide

520
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:15,840
people into a gender binary

521
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:18,480
which is a thing that happens um

522
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:19,280
so i want to say google if you did fix

523
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,000
the problem

524
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:23,280
with identification and the gorillas and

525
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,080
black people

526
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:26,559
thanks a lot and if you didn't i'm going

527
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:30,000
to ask

528
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:32,639
why you haven't fixed it yet and i think

529
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,320
that really should be a priority because

530
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,200
if a technology does not work for

531
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:38,480
everyone

532
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:41,840
it doesn't work right one of the things

533
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:44,320
that is the dream and the promise

534
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:46,159
of free software is that we're going to

535
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:49,200
be able to build technology

536
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:50,720
that works for everyone uh

537
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,400
not just the people developing

538
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:55,200
developing it not just the

539
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,679
like this the idea of who we have using

540
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,919
it

541
00:19:55,679 --> 00:20:00,080
um but anyone who wants to have access

542
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:00,559
to it like we're designing software for

543
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,559
people in

544
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:04,720
all countries people of all languages

545
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:07,360
people of all abilities

546
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:09,120
right when we talk about the practical

547
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:11,918
benefits of free software

548
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:12,719
we talk about things like the ability to

549
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:15,120
specialize

550
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:16,720
technology we talk about the ability to

551
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:18,559
make modifications

552
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:20,480
we talk about how you can make

553
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:21,039
modifications that make it easier for

554
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:24,080
people

555
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:24,960
who have movement issues uh to use

556
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:28,000
something

557
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:28,960
right um i learned recently about some

558
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,960
things of

559
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:34,320
um of uh capacitive recognition so like

560
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,880
using touch screens

561
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:37,760
uh and the way that mobility issues tie

562
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:40,480
into that

563
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:41,679
so ideally what would happen in response

564
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:44,000
to it is

565
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:45,520
like a community would take that on and

566
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,320
make those changes

567
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:50,320
um because they're able to right so

568
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:52,320
there's this beautiful promise that we

569
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:54,000
have for the future of technology

570
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:56,000
and the future of building this like

571
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,880
wonderful equitable world

572
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,320
that comes from free software so when

573
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:04,720
our technology doesn't work

574
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:06,879
it doesn't work for anyone um

575
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:08,960
when i was researching this ring did not

576
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:10,320
use facial recognition software however

577
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,960
they had this guy

578
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:15,439
um this guy according to the internet is

579
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:18,400
the head of facial recognition at ring

580
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:19,520
so it seems to me that they have a plan

581
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:22,480
at least to

582
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:23,679
fully incorporate that uh into the way

583
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,440
that things are working

584
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:26,799
you know there could be some benefits to

585
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:29,600
this theoretically

586
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:30,799
where you can have uh your doorbell

587
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,399
recognize

588
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:34,240
the people who live in the house oh

589
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:37,039
that's the next slide

590
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:38,080
you can have people smart locks you can

591
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:40,640
have people

592
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:42,080
uh installing smart locks and then have

593
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:45,200
those smart locks

594
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:45,520
recognize who lives in a house and give

595
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,520
them

596
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:49,280
immediate access to getting inside

597
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:52,080
without having to use a key

598
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:53,600
without having to store other biometrics

599
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:56,879
in general i think

600
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:58,799
a lot of us view our faces and our gates

601
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:01,600
because there's also gate recognition

602
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:03,520
um and that's being developed uh but our

603
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:05,678
faces our gates and our images

604
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,639
as a thing that is a lot more public and

605
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:10,000
that other people

606
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:12,799
just have access to um in

607
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,400
a number of places you lose the the

608
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:16,158
right to privacy into not being

609
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,280
photographed once you're in a public

610
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:19,440
space

611
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:21,840
um so suddenly these things we value

612
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,960
less they're being stored

613
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:25,360
and that's nicer than having your

614
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:27,760
fingerprints stored

615
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:30,479
one of the games i like to play is the

616
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:33,200
idea is when you look at a technology

617
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:35,840
and you say how can this be used for

618
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:38,080
horrible dystopic future

619
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,959
um and when i think about facial

620
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:42,720
recognition

621
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:46,159
and cloud storage that is

622
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:48,480
famously and commonly extremely insecure

623
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:49,760
you suddenly have this wonderful

624
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:52,720
collection

625
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:54,559
of faces and now that we have deep fakes

626
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:56,240
which i learned what they were recently

627
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:58,399
i mean i like i knew what they were but

628
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:01,919
i didn't like i was like oh deep fakes

629
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:04,080
um once we like now that we have

630
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:06,400
really incredible ability to fabricate

631
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:08,480
images we have the ability to fabricate

632
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:12,159
images with this data we have

633
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:15,280
right um when uh

634
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:15,919
yeah so we have this ability to to use

635
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:18,960
that

636
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:19,600
um and i think that's actually really

637
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:22,240
scary

638
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:23,199
um all sides of this also tying back

639
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:26,159
into

640
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:27,120
the fallibility of facial recognition

641
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:29,919
software

642
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:30,639
we suddenly see a greater likelihood of

643
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:33,679
people being

644
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:35,600
unable to get into their homes because

645
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:37,360
they don't look like the people who are

646
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:40,000
developing these technologies in the

647
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:43,439
first place

648
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:46,000
um most smart home devices

649
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:47,600
and iot things in general are installed

650
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,640
by men

651
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,639
we're transitioning a bit

652
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:56,640
and that's that's just a thing that

653
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,520
happens uh not this is not true of all

654
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:00,720
cases

655
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:03,440
i certainly want to give acknowledgement

656
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:05,919
uh to women and non-binary people who

657
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:07,600
are taking on this ownership themselves

658
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:09,279
but like the truth is just most of them

659
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:11,199
are installed by men

660
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:12,960
um this is where i'm gonna talk about

661
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,760
abuse and domestic violence for a few

662
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,520
minutes

663
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:17,440
um so if that's a thing you're not

664
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:21,440
comfortable with that's cool and you

665
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:21,440
should leave the room or like earmuff

666
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:27,120
the majority of intimate partner

667
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:28,720
violence ipv is perpetrated against

668
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:31,760
women

669
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:32,000
this means that by and large when you

670
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,840
have

671
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,039
domestic abuse happening when you have

672
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:38,158
people

673
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:41,520
physically injuring their partners it's

674
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:44,159
being received by a woman right

675
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:45,520
um and male perpetrated intimate partner

676
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:48,559
violence results in more

677
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:51,520
injuries so when

678
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:52,799
like cases where a woman hits uh hits

679
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:55,760
someone

680
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:56,639
in general in cases of intimate partner

681
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:59,360
violence

682
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:00,320
there is less physical repercussions

683
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:03,360
then those happen

684
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:04,799
when they're done by men

685
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:06,719
incidentally or additionally the

686
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:10,320
majority of stalking victims

687
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:11,200
are women i don't have this number in my

688
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:15,840
notes

689
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:15,840
i forget but i think it's something like

690
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:20,240
oh god i'm mixing up i might be mixing

691
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:23,440
up rape and stalking statistics

692
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:24,880
um now i don't know the stalking

693
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:26,080
statistics off the top of my head i'm

694
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,799
sorry i'll look it up later if you're

695
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:30,320
curious

696
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:33,279
i have it somewhere um so

697
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:33,918
you know stalking that's the thing

698
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:37,279
happens

699
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:40,480
especially to women the

700
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:42,320
majority of rapes are perpetrated by men

701
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,840
and the majority of stalking is done by

702
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:47,039
men uh

703
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:47,840
so and and the majority of the victims

704
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:51,520
of these things

705
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:53,678
are women um so in terms of rapes in the

706
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:55,679
united states about one in four women

707
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:56,960
uh has an experience of being raped over

708
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:58,640
the course of their life

709
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:00,080
on the other hand i think it's about 1

710
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:02,320
in 19 men

711
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:03,439
um and those are terrible horrible

712
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:07,200
statistics

713
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:09,840
and they make me really sad um

714
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:12,240
and they're much worse than we they

715
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:12,240
should be

716
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:17,440
but those are the numbers that i found

717
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:18,400
so things like smart locks and iot

718
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:22,240
devices

719
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:24,400
in general enable this new type of abuse

720
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:28,080
that we hadn't seen before

721
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:31,200
right um so some examples

722
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:34,000
of what has happened to people

723
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:36,240
um as there's big things like a woman

724
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,799
had a stalker turn off the brakes in her

725
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,720
car

726
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:40,158
when she was on the highway he did this

727
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:43,600
remotely

728
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:47,039
he did this because he had access to her

729
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:48,959
system he had hacked into it he

730
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:52,960
was able to control this he was able to

731
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:54,880
track her using the gps in the car

732
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:56,159
and he shut off the brakes on the

733
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:59,600
highway

734
00:26:56,159 --> 00:27:02,960
really scary um we

735
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:04,959
have had cases of what might seem like

736
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:07,279
minor domestic abuse

737
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:08,000
not not violence but abuse of things

738
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:11,039
like

739
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:14,720
people controlling temperature

740
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:16,960
when there are smart home thermostats

741
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:18,320
so alternating the temperature between

742
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:20,960
being really hot

743
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:22,720
and being really cold especially at

744
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:26,240
inappropriate times

745
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:28,080
um this uh this creates discomfort

746
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:29,520
um thinks about controlling sound

747
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:32,399
systems uh

748
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:33,679
in homes which creates a space where

749
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:36,639
maybe you can't sleep

750
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:37,600
right something recognized as a form of

751
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:39,440
torture

752
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:42,559
is preventing people from sleeping by

753
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:45,279
playing loud music or loud noises

754
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:48,720
at regular intervals to prevent them

755
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:50,159
from having the opportunity to sleep

756
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,840
so these are a few things that i knew

757
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:53,600
happened and here are some things i

758
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:55,439
don't know if they have happened yet

759
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:56,879
but there are opportunities to do things

760
00:27:55,440 --> 00:28:00,640
like say

761
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:04,720
lock someone out of their house or

762
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:07,600
unlock the door to their house

763
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:08,880
so let's say you have a stalker or a

764
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:12,158
violent partner

765
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:14,159
that you're trying to hide from and they

766
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:17,679
can get into your home whenever they

767
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:19,520
want right and this can be to

768
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:20,720
infiltrate your per infiltrate your

769
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:24,240
personal space

770
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:26,480
but it could also be to harm you um

771
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:27,360
a lot of this these kinds of things in

772
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:30,799
general

773
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:33,360
are affecting our sense of security

774
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:35,600
in the safe spaces we do have and we

775
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:37,600
have very limited safe spaces especially

776
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:39,439
as more surveillance is happening

777
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:41,520
we have very few places where we can be

778
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:42,960
alone and we have very few places where

779
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:45,440
we can be secure

780
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:47,840
right when you lose the the opportunity

781
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:49,679
to have that in your own home

782
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:51,520
you're creating a space for your like

783
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:52,159
you're giving up this kind of space for

784
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:55,520
yourself

785
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:56,840
you don't feel at ease um one of the

786
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:59,918
things that women

787
00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:01,360
who've been the victims of iot enabled

788
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:03,600
abuse have reported

789
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:04,799
is that getting rid of the devices is

790
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:08,240
like

791
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:11,440
the best and is very freeing

792
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:15,200
um so we have this technology

793
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:18,080
that is like you know

794
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:19,360
actually really cool and can make a big

795
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,720
difference in the lives of people

796
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:23,678
especially people

797
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:24,640
who have mobility issues who have vision

798
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:27,039
issues

799
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:29,360
who have hearing issues you know they

800
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:33,120
allow you to connect with the world

801
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:34,879
in these much more like intimate ways

802
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:36,879
but these technologies also have the

803
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:38,720
ability to really hurt people

804
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:40,320
and those aren't the conversations we're

805
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:43,600
having and those are the conversations

806
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:46,480
we really need to be having

807
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:47,439
so right now uh i hope you should be

808
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:50,640
asking yourself

809
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:51,840
or thinking this is terrible why did i

810
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:54,640
sit through

811
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:58,000
30 minutes of you making me feel bad

812
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:59,600
about the state of technology

813
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,679
so there are things you can do to make a

814
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:04,080
difference especially as people

815
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:05,919
who are technologists especially as

816
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:07,840
people who are invested in technology

817
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:08,960
who are working for non-profits who are

818
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:12,158
activists

819
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:14,480
who are involved in policy

820
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:16,720
and making changes but also just as

821
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:20,559
citizens because as citizens

822
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:22,880
of where you live you have power

823
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:25,120
right so one of the best things you can

824
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:27,039
do is just be thoughtful

825
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:28,479
think about what you're designing think

826
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:31,840
about what you're building

827
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:33,840
think about your community and make sure

828
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:35,520
that the policies being created that the

829
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:37,840
law is being created

830
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:38,720
that the technology being created is

831
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:41,678
equitable and

832
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:42,960
safe you know you can't necessarily make

833
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:46,640
parental controls

834
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:47,919
on an operating system like

835
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:50,559
one of the things that could potentially

836
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:52,000
be a problem with parental controls on

837
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:55,360
any type of system

838
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:58,960
is it provides isolation for glbtq

839
00:30:55,360 --> 00:31:00,158
youth um so that's like not good

840
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:02,640
but there are a lot of good that come

841
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:04,559
out of it too so you might not have

842
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:07,360
answers to these questions

843
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:08,960
and that's okay right at the moment we

844
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:10,080
don't have answers to all these

845
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:13,120
questions

846
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:15,199
but if we think about them if we attempt

847
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:17,039
to incorporate these ideas and if we

848
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:19,120
attempt to build things like

849
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:21,039
like knowledge sharing and education

850
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:23,279
into both our development

851
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:24,960
and the use of these technologies like

852
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:26,559
that's that's a really great starting

853
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:28,000
point

854
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:30,639
something else you can do is putting

855
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:33,200
pressure on people and governments

856
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:33,679
when designing technologies and policies

857
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:36,320
uh

858
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:37,200
pressure campaigns can work um they have

859
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:40,399
been successful

860
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:41,519
for different things um i would really

861
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:46,000
like to at this opportu

862
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:48,080
at this point draw attention to

863
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,600
the organizing that google employees

864
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:51,519
have been doing

865
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:54,080
around their rights and around labor

866
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:58,000
practices

867
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:58,000
there's like

868
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:02,480
equitability for women terrible things

869
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:05,760
people are doing

870
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:06,799
blah blah oh dragonfly that's what i was

871
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:10,158
thinking of

872
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:13,120
project dragonfly was when

873
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:14,559
google made a deal to build a censored

874
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:17,918
search engine

875
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:19,360
for china for use in china

876
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:21,679
so that was the thing that google

877
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:22,879
employees put a lot of pressure on the

878
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:24,480
company about

879
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:25,919
and the result of that was the project

880
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:29,120
was cancelled

881
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:32,240
um you know when in

882
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:35,279
massachusetts uh in new england where

883
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:37,760
i lived until very recently um

884
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:39,039
there has been no facial recognition

885
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:40,000
there have been facial recognitions

886
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:43,039
banned

887
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,799
past in different places in the state

888
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:46,640
and that's really incredible and really

889
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:48,080
wonderful to see

890
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:50,799
and the work has been done by

891
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:53,918
organizations like fight for the future

892
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:55,840
and the aclu but also a lot of the work

893
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:56,559
has just been done by individuals who

894
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:58,559
care

895
00:32:56,559 --> 00:33:00,639
who want to make these things happen and

896
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:04,559
who want to see a difference

897
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:06,080
occurring you can also just make your

898
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:08,480
iot open and free

899
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:10,320
right all those benefits that we get

900
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:13,679
from having free software

901
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:14,158
uh hold just as true for iot um i know

902
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:16,320
that

903
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:18,080
after this there's going to be a talk

904
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:21,120
about um

905
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:22,320
the ethics of ai and i think that really

906
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:24,320
ties into this

907
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:25,519
when we're looking at things like image

908
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:27,918
recognition

909
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:30,080
um voice recognition gate recognition

910
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:31,039
how that's being incorporated into iot

911
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:33,360
devices

912
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:34,080
um and by having these things be

913
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:36,719
available

914
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:38,639
and auditable auditable's a really big

915
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:41,919
thing here for me

916
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:45,120
you're creating a dynamic where people

917
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:46,559
are able to make these changes to know

918
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:48,320
what they're using to know what they're

919
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:51,120
consenting to use to know what they're

920
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:53,039
putting into their homes

921
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:54,559
and i think that's really powerful but

922
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:55,919
you're also making space

923
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:57,760
for people to make the kinds of

924
00:33:55,919 --> 00:34:00,240
additions and modifications

925
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:01,760
to these technologies to make them safer

926
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:05,039
for their own homes

927
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:08,079
um i think the uh

928
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:09,359
the argument that like oh you can modify

929
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:12,800
this technology

930
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:15,440
if it's free is like not the best one um

931
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:17,760
because like that's great but a lot of

932
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:19,918
us i don't have those skills

933
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:21,040
and i don't have the resources to pay

934
00:34:19,918 --> 00:34:23,359
someone to

935
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:25,199
who has those skills to spend the time

936
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:27,679
developing something for me

937
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:29,759
um but i found that there are people out

938
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:30,399
there who really care about what's going

939
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:33,119
on

940
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:35,118
um and who make those like who will make

941
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:36,800
those kinds of development choices

942
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:38,399
um something else that i know matthew

943
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:41,520
garrett has been doing

944
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:44,638
um is doing iot uh

945
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:45,520
security testing uh then writing amazon

946
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:48,800
reviews

947
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:50,320
uh explaining these problems now

948
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:52,159
there's like provisions to allow

949
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:55,679
security testing

950
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:56,480
and finding vulnerabilities but it's a

951
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:59,040
lot easier

952
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:01,760
if the technology is available under a

953
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:03,520
free and open source license

954
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:05,280
something you can do is investigate and

955
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:06,160
understand software and what's happening

956
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,680
with it right

957
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:09,118
so it's like i said i like to play this

958
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:10,960
game where i think about the dystopic

959
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:12,960
future and dystopic uses of

960
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:14,079
software and technology you can play

961
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:17,359
that too

962
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:20,160
we can play it together it'd be fun

963
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:20,640
um i think it's really fun at least uh

964
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:23,279
so

965
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:24,319
think about the way that the things

966
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:26,560
you're building

967
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:28,400
are impacting people right look at the

968
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:30,400
papers and the research around

969
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:32,480
image recognition technology and where

970
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:35,599
it's failing

971
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:38,200
find out the spaces where things

972
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:39,680
are being used for abuse and find

973
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:42,960
opportunities

974
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:46,399
to uh like take that into account

975
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:48,400
in your development you know

976
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:49,680
this is largely like i feel very

977
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:52,000
strongly about this because

978
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:53,759
i think a lot about user autonomy and

979
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,000
user consent right

980
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:57,599
we want people to be able to choose the

981
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,280
tools they're using

982
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:00,640
from a place of understanding what's

983
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:02,720
going on with them

984
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:03,759
right and if we can't understand our

985
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:07,279
technology

986
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:11,119
we can't like truly say i'm fine

987
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:14,160
interacting with this right um

988
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:16,079
like you know it's kind of

989
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:17,680
it's kind of important um i certainly

990
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:18,720
know people who are uncomfortable being

991
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:22,000
in the homes of

992
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:24,240
iot devices that listen um

993
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,599
and you know because you don't really

994
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:27,520
know what's happening with it

995
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:29,359
and there's like lots of terrible

996
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:31,040
stories about like

997
00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:33,680
things being recorded and things being

998
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:34,720
shared and responses and advertising and

999
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:37,919
marketing

1000
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:40,240
um so knowing what's happening

1001
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:41,920
allows us to make decisions about what

1002
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:43,598
we're using ourselves you know knowing

1003
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:45,920
the potential risks

1004
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:47,280
of what might happen by having the

1005
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:50,320
ability to remotely

1006
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:53,200
turn off the brakes to my car uh i might

1007
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:56,960
not choose to buy that car

1008
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:59,520
boop um you can also build freedom

1009
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:01,920
into your jobs and into your contracts

1010
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:04,960
shameless pitch

1011
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:06,640
you have the opportunity when making

1012
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:08,160
contracts with employers

1013
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:10,480
to ensure that the work you're doing is

1014
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:12,000
free and open right you can

1015
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:13,920
get your co-workers together and use

1016
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:17,440
those pressure campaigns

1017
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:19,200
and to make differences um in the stuff

1018
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:20,880
you're building and in your jobs

1019
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:22,480
that will also help make sure that the

1020
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:24,400
things you're developing are useful for

1021
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:26,400
the future

1022
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:27,839
something you can do is build on top of

1023
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,680
other tools

1024
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:30,960
that already exist especially ones that

1025
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:34,879
are free uh

1026
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:37,920
because this enables um

1027
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:40,079
like the continuation of license uses

1028
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:43,520
especially under copyleft licenses

1029
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:45,280
um i think that's pretty cool

1030
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:46,720
um you can also support organizations

1031
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,760
that are doing work on this like the

1032
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:50,319
aclu

1033
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:51,520
um or whatever your local equivalent is

1034
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:53,200
um

1035
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:54,960
these are organizations that provide

1036
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:58,799
support advocacy

1037
00:37:54,960 --> 00:38:00,960
activism and also uh legal support

1038
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:02,880
um in taking things to the next level

1039
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:04,400
when necessary the electronic frontiers

1040
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,760
foundation is also involved in these

1041
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:08,000
kinds of activities

1042
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:09,359
so by supporting orgs you're helping to

1043
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,400
make these things happen

1044
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:12,319
you're helping to make sure this

1045
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:14,240
research happens you're helping to make

1046
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:16,800
sure this awareness happens right

1047
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:17,759
like it's pretty cool that the nonprofit

1048
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:19,680
i worked for

1049
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:21,359
is paying for me to be here to talk to

1050
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:24,399
you and we're like

1051
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:27,279
educating people i hope right

1052
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:28,560
so together we can build a better future

1053
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:31,599
for technology for

1054
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:33,920
ourselves for our neighbors for society

1055
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:35,680
and that's wonderful and makes me so

1056
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:37,119
happy that that's a possibility and i'm

1057
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:40,078
really glad the microphone didn't fly

1058
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:42,240
off my face when i did that

1059
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:43,760
so that's what i have uh if you have any

1060

00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:42,640
the floor and encourage questions

1084

uh from women people of color uh people

1085

america um

1088
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:50,000
and non-binary folks just because you

1089
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,879
know they're less likely to ask

1090
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,440
questions

1091
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:54,560
hi so thanks for your talks i have a

1092
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:57,359
question do you know

00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:58,480
any existing solution about home

1094
00:39:57,359 --> 00:40:03,598
surveillance which is

1095
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:06,800
open source and open hardware um

1096
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:09,200
open source alternatives to what or

1097
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:10,240
open hardware oh open hardware so some

1098
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:13,439
of that exists

1099
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:16,560
um i know foss asia is working on a

1100

um uh i

1102
00:40:20,319 --> 00:40:23,440
don't know a lot about open hardware

1103
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:25,759
though i

1104
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:27,040
mostly are focused on software so i'm

1105
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:29,200
sorry i don't have a better answer for

1106
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:29,200
you

1107
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:33,520
i see a question here from one deb

1108
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:35,839
nicholson

1109
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:36,960
and i see a lot of people moving around

1110
00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:38,480
which is cool too

1111
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:40,640
you know look at your feet oh and a

1112
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:43,680
question over there in the corner

1113
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:43,680
not corner but it's fine

1114
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:50,960
hi my immune system tries to murder me

1115
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:52,240
so this is very dear to my heart are

1116
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:54,079
there any

1117
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:56,560
projects organizations that have a

1118
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:59,359
disability focused

1119
00:40:56,560 --> 00:41:01,040
lens on this issue because you mentioned

1120
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:01,759
a lot of accessibility reasons why

1121
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:04,720
people would use

1122
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:06,640
iot devices and a lot of those

1123
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:10,480
discussions are being drowned out

1124
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:11,920
by open source and privacy purists who

1125
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:13,680
are not even interested in the

1126
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:16,240
conversation

1127
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:18,240
um i don't know of anyone focusing on

1128
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:20,240
accessibility actually

1129
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:22,399
especially around the relationship

1130
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:25,680
between accessibility

1131
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:28,240
and um uh and

1132
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:29,040
free software and open source software

1133
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:30,799
um

1134
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:33,520
i have found a lot of really great

1135
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:36,880
support and uh responses to questions

1136
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:38,480
from a11y twitter

1137
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:40,720
and someone there might know something

1138
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,720
more

1139
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:49,440
hi thank you for your talk my question's

1140
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,839
about intersectionality

1141
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:53,040
and how when we're engineering solutions

1142
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:55,520
to all of our problems

1143
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:56,640
how we're supposed to prioritize which

1144
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:59,200
protected

1145
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:59,920
characteristics we kind of go for first

1146
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,680
because

1147
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:04,960
it's not always possible to have an

1148
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:07,359
all-encompassing piece of work

1149
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:09,119
so i think one of the most important

1150
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:11,759
things for building solutions

1151
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:13,520
is to try and build diverse teams of

1152
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:16,720
people

1153
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:18,480
who are working on your stuff sometimes

1154
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:20,240
building diverse teams is really hard

1155
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:21,760
for a variety of reasons

1156
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:24,560
and sometimes it can even feel not

1157
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:26,240
possible i have lots of suggestions and

1158
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:29,839
ideas and other people do too

1159
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:31,759
about how to do that better a proposal

1160
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:35,040
that came up to me recently

1161
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:37,040
was consulting like not what was the

1162
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:39,440
idea of hiring consultants

1163
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:41,520
to come in to your projects to help you

1164
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:43,359
understand these things to do audits

1165
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:46,400
um and to provide you with the resources

1166
00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:46,400
to make those differences

1167
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:53,040
please so uh i i it was a long

1168
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:54,800
sorry i'm having trouble hearing you yes

1169
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:57,599
it's it's right now

1170
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:59,920
yes for me i don't share absolutely not

1171
00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:00,720
your enthusiasm about this kind of

1172
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:03,760
things

1173
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:06,640
for me there's a lot of disadvantages

1174
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:08,040
so you have the they say nothing about

1175
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:10,960
electrosmog

1176
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:14,480
electrosmokesome you you are

1177
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:16,800
liking loving some animals but the bees

1178
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:17,680
are very sensitive to this kind of thing

1179
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:21,520
and all

1180
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:24,799
uh the humans also electrosensitive

1181
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:27,839
humans so they can not not think any

1182
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:30,000
no not make anything in this context of

1183
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:31,599
electrosmog that's also that's a really

1184
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,040
good point but is this a question

1185
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:36,800
you have a question yes there is also

1186
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:39,759
the problem also of privacy

1187
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:41,440
so the power of melting of transnational

1188
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:44,400
companies big brother

1189
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:45,200
in hong kong so the government of china

1190
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:48,240
is a good

1191
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:51,520
good citizen can a spy uh

1192
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:53,759
everybody so all these kind of things

1193
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:55,119
you you don't say there is some

1194
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:59,040
advantage but so

1195
00:43:55,119 --> 00:44:01,680
uh for me it uh in place instead of use

1196
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:02,960
with fee you can use also infrared

1197
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:05,839
communication

1198
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:06,160
um do you have a question yes so i have

1199
00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:08,319
no

1200
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:09,359
question okay great let's move on to the

1201
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:11,759
next question

1202
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:13,598
that's what i would like to focus on i

1203
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:14,079
see in the front we've had a hand raised

1204
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:16,640
a little

1205
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:16,640
a few times

1206
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:21,839
i do actually have a question you

1207
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:22,400
mentioned that uh the recommendation

1208
00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:24,880
when

1209
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:26,000
uh stocking is happening via some of

1210
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:28,319
these iot devices

1211
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:30,160
is just to get rid of it is that advice

1212
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:32,720
from law enforcement or do you know

1213
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:34,640
is there any work being done to kind of

1214
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:36,160
get law enforcement to understand this

1215
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:39,200
problem a little better um

1216
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:40,960
i would not say that it's like

1217
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:43,040
the official definitive recommendation

1218
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:45,839
and the only one it's something

1219
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:48,960
that people have reported doing and

1220
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:48,960
having success with

1221
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:53,279
in terms of the psychological benefits

1222
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:56,640
of of getting rid of their devices

1223
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:59,839
um i don't know so i know that uh eva

1224
00:44:56,640 --> 00:45:01,520
galpern galparin um from the eff

1225
00:44:59,839 --> 00:45:04,160
is doing a lot of work especially with

1226
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:06,319
uh abuse survivors and abuse victims

1227
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:08,240
on how to do a better job securing their

1228
00:45:06,319 --> 00:45:10,880
stuff she gave a ted talk recently

1229
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:12,879
i have not seen yet um but i'm excited

1230
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:14,560
to watch it at some point

1231
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:16,079
and i think there are other people

1232
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:19,119
interested in it

1233
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:21,599
i know i have had just like initial

1234
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:24,880
conversations with some women shelters

1235
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:28,240
uh that are interested in like talking

1236
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:28,240
about these topics more

1237
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:36,319
hi so you mentioned about consulting

1238
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:39,359
uh to make better products that make

1239
00:45:36,319 --> 00:45:40,079
considerations of these things um but so

1240
00:45:39,359 --> 00:45:42,640
often

1241
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:43,760
the responsibility of making things

1242
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:45,920
better and more inclusive

1243
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:48,079
lies with the people that have had these

1244
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:50,880
often awful experiences

1245
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:52,000
are there any resources or trainings or

1246
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:54,160
things out there that people that

1247
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:57,280
haven't experienced these things could

1248
00:45:54,160 --> 00:46:01,200
look to to try and like almost simulate

1249
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:02,720
or get better at like not relying on the

1250
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:04,640
people they've experienced

1251
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:06,160
um these are great questions because

1252
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:07,118
they're hard and most of the answers i

1253
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:10,319
have are like

1254
00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:12,560
that's a great idea i don't know um what

1255
00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:13,920
i've been doing is i've been reading uh

1256
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:15,520
more books

1257
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:17,359
relating to these topics to educate

1258
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:18,800
myself i've been

1259
00:46:17,359 --> 00:46:20,720
working my way through so you want to

1260
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:23,440
talk about race uh

1261
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:24,959
and yes means yes um yes means yes is a

1262
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:27,680
book about consent

1263
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:30,079
um specifically sexual consent but it

1264
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:33,598
ties into a lot of these issues as well

1265
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:35,040
uh and i think like that's a good place

1266
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:38,640
for all of us to start

1267
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:39,440
um i hate saying social media is the

1268
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:41,359
answer

1269
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:43,119
but they're like following diverse

1270
00:46:41,359 --> 00:46:44,640
people on social media especially

1271
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:45,839
diverse people in tech

1272
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:47,920
because they will talk about these

1273
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:49,920
issues all the time

1274
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:51,760
since they impact them personally and

1275
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:52,960
this is still those people taking on the

1276
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:56,160
emotional labor

1277
00:46:52,960 --> 00:47:00,079
of trying to make these changes

1278
00:46:56,160 --> 00:47:04,160
but it's not you expecting them to give

1279
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:04,160
you a 101 course every time

1280
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:09,040
so is there anybody actually compiling a

1281
00:47:08,319 --> 00:47:12,319
list or

1282
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:16,319
of recommendations of products that do

1283
00:47:12,319 --> 00:47:18,480
work well in terms of actually not just

1284
00:47:16,319 --> 00:47:20,160
giving your information away and helping

1285
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:21,359
people to act

1286
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:23,118
we could really do with good

1287
00:47:21,359 --> 00:47:24,000
recommendations to give to our friends

1288
00:47:23,119 --> 00:47:25,760
and family on

1289
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:27,119
the white products that are not just

1290
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:29,839
going to fail

1291
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:31,280
in these ways um i know that there have

1292
00:47:29,839 --> 00:47:35,279
been academic studies

1293
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:37,200
on security issues um around devices

1294
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:38,480
uh so that kind of can provide you a

1295
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:40,078
list of like what not

1296
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:42,000
to go for which is very different from

1297
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:44,640
what's better um

1298
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,520
i know that if i got karen galpern does

1299
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:46,480
anyone

1300
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:48,720
talk to me later if you know how to

1301
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:52,400
pronounce her name um

1302
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:55,919
uh is has been developing resources uh

1303
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:58,960
focused on like iot safety and

1304
00:47:55,920 --> 00:48:00,800
like risk mitigation um

1305
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:02,160
and that's a really good place to kind

1306
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:04,319
of like start checking those things out

1307
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:06,480
and learning about it

1308
00:48:04,319 --> 00:48:17,440
i'm afraid we're out of time great

1309
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:17,440
thanks so much everyone
