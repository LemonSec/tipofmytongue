00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,320
hi

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:10,320
i'm ayal i'm very lucky because i have

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,960
the logo of the teach of the project

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,040
here

5
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,400
it's called albonite we started a

6
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,678
project like about

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,840
seven months ago it's about the

8
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:19,199
centralized websites about eight months

9
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,279
ago sorry

10
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:23,279
um we actually called this center as

11
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:24,240
website d websites because in the first

12
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:26,000
talk that i gave

13
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,519
i said this centers websites like 50

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,400
times and i broke my tongue so the

15
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:32,558
website is much easier to say

16
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,680
and normally right now i would show you

17
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:36,718
what i mean

18
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:39,680
by d websites and i would show you the

19
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:42,160
decentralized search engine for

20
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,920
decentralized websites which we created

21
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:47,038
but since the connection does not work

22
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,039
this is not going to happen

23
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:53,199
yes okay so the websites are basically

24
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,039
uh kind of an alternative to the regular

25
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:57,120
websites we did not invent

26
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:59,039
the website so zero net at least was

27
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,239
from 2015 and i'm not sure if there was

28
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:02,559
something before

29
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:04,158
we also didn't invent the method that we

30
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:06,240
are using which is connecting

31
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:08,240
uh ethereum like the centralized name

32
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:11,199
system and the ipfs

33
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:12,158
what we do do is tools for the website

34
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,680
which basically

35
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:17,439
means kind of search engine for search

36
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,640
and with index all the d websites that

37
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:21,839
people create

38
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:23,759
and we have a browser extension for you

39
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,600
to access the websites because otherwise

40
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:26,080
from the regular browser it doesn't work

41
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,240
unless

42
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,840
you use opera for mobile where it

43
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:32,000
actually works natively on status

44
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,479
browser and stuff like it

45
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,840
and we also plan to have kind of

46
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:40,240
building tools for the

47
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:41,840
websites when i

48
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,839
okay let's begin with the project

49
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,240
al-munit al-munit

50
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,360
maybe sounds a bit strange the name it

51
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,600
means anonymous

52
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,560
in hebrew so i'm from israel i'm living

53
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,079
in berlin

54
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,360
and the reason that we have this lion

55
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:54,398
here i'm really lucky to have the

56
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,240
t-shirt

57
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,399
by the way we have five extra tissues to

58
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:00,240
sell for 20 years if anybody wants uh

59
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:01,680
because the minimum amounts to make was

60
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,640
10 and we we

61
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,640
are only five people

62
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,280
so we got really five t-shirts we will

63
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,200
be happy to sell them and maybe we'll be

64
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,319
able to pay for ourselves for a beer

65
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,958
which is already something for this

66
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:16,480
project yeah so if

67
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:18,160
in israel there is almond ellie

68
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,720
anonymous ellie and if you go in the

69
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,200
alley

70
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,959
there is a statue of a golden lion in

71
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,679
the end which is why we have the golden

72
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:24,879
lion

73
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,720
and then the other reason we have the

74
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:27,920
golden lion is that mozilla have a fox

75
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,239
and we like mozilla

76
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,359
so when a fox and a lion is already like

77
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:32,720
a jungle and we

78
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,519
we want the internet to be like a jungle

79
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:39,359
so it's also like kind of a statement

80
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:40,800
um regular websites basically you know

81
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,080
like explain to me like i'm five years

82
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,319
old

83
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,400
like all of you probably know i'm

84
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:49,359
simplifying here is you go to a dns

85
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,000
you you have a name you go to a dns the

86
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,319
dns tells

87
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
you in which server actually you can

88
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:55,518
find the content of this name

89
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,280
when you go to the server and the server

90
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:58,959
gives you the website and there is all

91
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,239
kind of interaction with the server to

92
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:03,599
create dynamics

93
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:05,280
things in a deal website we do almost

94
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:06,959
the exact same thing you have a name but

95
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,080
you don't go to a server you go to a

96
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:11,519
decentralized

97
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,920
name service which all the ones that i

98
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:13,360
know

99
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,599
are existing on blockchain so you have

100
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,040
namecoin and you have ens and you have

101
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:18,720
stoppable domains and you have

102
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,560
actually quite a few others right now

103
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:23,840
which are up and coming

104
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:25,120
we use ens because at the moment i think

105
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,720
it's the most developed one

106
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,760
but basically the concept does not

107
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,159
depend on it so we go to ens and then we

108
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,679
get

109
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:34,480
where is the decentralized website

110
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:38,080
existing and what we get is kind of uh

111
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:39,679
identifier in our decentralized uh

112
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,519
decentralized storage so in our file

113
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,560
sharing system

114
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:45,680
we use ipfs and from there we have a

115
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,000
browser extension that does a very

116
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,040
simple

117
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,080
thing you enter the the name in the url

118
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:53,040
bar

119
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,959
you get you go to ens you get where the

120
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,319
website you go to ipfs you get the

121
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:58,560
website

122
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:59,359
and because of ipfs special structure

123
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,599
you can also

124
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,879
create some kind of interactive

125
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:05,359
experience

126
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:06,959
between you and the website which is

127
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,400
already nice

128
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,080
when you do that you have like three

129
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:13,200
regular advantages

130
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,480
of decentralization so it's super robust

131
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,920
even in this native

132
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,079
form there are only a few hundred

133
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:21,120
websites are creating nowadays but

134
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:23,120
to dd osbn would be the ddos ipfs and

135
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,960
ethereum blockchain and and

136
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,160
this is super difficult so it's really

137
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:29,440
robust

138
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:31,440
it's also private at least in a

139
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:33,600
different way regular websites so it is

140
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:35,919
as private as ethereum and ipfs

141
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:38,880
are and we can argue how much private is

142
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:40,560
that it's a peer-to-peer

143
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,240
network but certainly it's a different

144
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,400
kind of privacy

145
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,000
and it's also a censorship censorship

146
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,799
resistance for the same reason but it's

147
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,479
robust

148
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,160
it's very difficult to censor

149
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:51,520
peer-to-peer networks

150
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,280
and the last thing that i really like

151
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:55,039
about it this is my personal

152
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,880
favorite thing is that you can do kind

153
00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:00,320
of a collective websites

154
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:03,360
so you can do a website which is being

155
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:05,759
created and maintained and controlled by

156
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,759
a group of people all over the world and

157
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:09,120
maintenance controllers control and

158
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:10,560
creation is being done kind of

159
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,560
automatically

160
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,320
uh which means it's really belong to a

161
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,680
group of people there is no one person

162
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,840
who does that

163
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,680
this is kind of an experiment that i

164
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:21,599
actually came up with so the only

165
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,199
collective website exists existing so

166
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,960
far is the demo that i made and i would

167
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:26,400
probably publish in the last two weeks

168
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,758
but it's a use case that really excites

169
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:30,000
me because i've been doing open source

170
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:31,759
projects with people all over the world

171
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,199
and they were some of them were about

172
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:34,800
blockchain and sometimes like who

173
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,759
operates the website really became a

174
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,759
difficult uh

175
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:39,120
risky or sensitive issue and here we can

176
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:41,680
do it like as a group so it's something

177
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,440
that i really like

178
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,800
vent almonds project like i said

179
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,600
basically

180
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:49,120
does right now three things there the

181
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,919
first one is the decentralized search

182
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,600
engine

183
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:53,680
which we are really proud of it was a

184
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,639
lot of work to do we have here the lead

185
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,759
developer

186
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:59,120
who did a fantastic job hi muhammad he's

187
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:00,080
a bit disappointed because i don't have

188
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:04,479
the presentation

189
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:04,479
but i hope i improvise well

190
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:08,639
it's right now runs client-side which

191
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
means

192
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,759
of course it's super private because

193
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,120
it's all by a client-side

194
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:14,720
you can do it because there are like

195
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,639
only a few hundred websites you can also

196
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:19,840
do it with maybe a few thousand websites

197
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:21,039
and that plan to scale it in the future

198
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:23,039
is i don't know how many

199
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:24,159
i mean if people know here know how how

200
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:25,840
ipfs work

201
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,520
but basically you can treat ipfs as one

202
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:30,638
big file system

203
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:31,520
and then we can just like divide the

204
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:33,840
index

205
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,960
of the search engine to many many parts

206
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,400
and when you will quarry

207
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,479
you will only query some of them so you

208
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,159
will not have to get all of it

209
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:41,919
we have like for the search engine like

210
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,479
three parts one of there is a

211
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:46,080
web crawler which i wrote it just calls

212
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:48,000
the ethereum blockchain all the time for

213
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:51,120
new websites and update of websites and

214
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,360
update the list of websites then we have

215
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,880
a scraper which is written in python and

216
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,520
we have a

217
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,960
beautiful edge i forgot the name of the

218
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,039
package

219
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,560
beautiful soup thank you which take text

220
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:03,759
from

221
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,520
from the website like take the website

222
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:07,599
give you text and we have like another

223
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,198
package to do the

224
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:10,800
actually scraping itself and all the

225
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:12,479
semantic stuff

226
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,360
and we have the website itself which is

227
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:18,318
our progressive web app

228
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,199
it really works fantastically in the way

229
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:22,160
that it looks

230
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:23,680
like a search engine like a proper one

231
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,039
and we are really part of it so

232
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:28,639
if you watch this talking you are

233
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:30,318
curious czecho munit

234
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:31,919
to really access the center's website

235
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:33,919
you need some kind of browser extension

236
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:35,520
so other our browser extension for which

237
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:36,639
exists for mozilla and chromium or

238
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,240
metamask

239
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:40,199
there is also gateways to to the

240
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,720
centralized website so if you type

241
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:44,639
almond.eth.link you get it

242
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,720
and then to finish the talk because my

243
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:48,960
time is up follow us on twitter

244
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,240
we need followers we what we really need

245
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,638
is people who

246
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:54,240
build the website and especially people

247
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:55,680
who experiment with this concept because

248
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:59,840
i think you can do a lot of interesting

249
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,840
stuff thank you very much
