1
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:08,080
so

2
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:17,759
so replicant is uh can everyone hear me

3
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:18,880
yeah so applicant is a fully free

4
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,160
android distribution

5
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,880
approved by the fsf but the hardware is

6
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,880
only

7
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:26,630
the hardware transom is not fully free

8
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,000
like it's smartphone and you have

9
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:32,079
[Music]

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:35,040
yeah i will see the detail later on that

11
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:36,559
so replicant the website is replicon.us

12
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:40,000
we exist since september

13
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:41,120
2009. we are currently based on line

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,480
address

15
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:47,199
so we are working on two android version

16
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:49,199
at the same time so android 6

17
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,760
because we support a lot of device with

18
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,800
it unfortunately the last security

19
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:56,399
update is from

20
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:58,480
october 2017 and

21
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:00,879
we're also working on importing all that

22
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,640
on android nine and it's still a working

23
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:05,039
progress as of today

24
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,680
so on applicant six which support about

25
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,040
like uh

26
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:12,479
10 devices uh with smartphone

27
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:14,640
tablets uh and we have about like uh

28
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:16,159
two like full-time contributors we have

29
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,520
more than two contributors but

30
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:22,560
equivalent is like two people full-time

31
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:24,960
so uh like we

32
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,280
as the distribution is fully free we

33
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:29,119
still want like to have

34
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,560
like minimum set of features that make

35
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:32,479
it still useful

36
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:35,119
like the display working the graphics

37
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:37,520
are fast enough to be usable we can make

38
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:39,119
like phone calls we have sound working

39
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:42,240
and so on but for instance some

40
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:44,159
auxiliary feature like gps or camera

41
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,320
like if it doesn't work for us it's not

42
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,479
the end of the world but we still try to

43
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,639
make them work if we can

44
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:51,840
so sometimes we even like had support

45
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,200
for more feature and

46
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,680
later release so so this is a smartphone

47
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,960
it's a

48
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:02,079
galaxy s3 oh uh

49
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:05,919
oh yeah the the thing is cut so

50
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:06,719
anyway uh so this is a stamina chip so

51
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,640
it's a

52
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:10,560
chip with a mini thing inside like the

53
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:13,040
main cpu sd controller

54
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,440
like display controller and whatnot and

55
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,959
it's connected here to another chip

56
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,120
where there's the modem going on

57
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:21,200
so this interacts with a cell phone

58
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:24,319
tower and

59
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:26,879
yeah and a sim card and it's connected

60
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:29,519
to a bus called hsic so it's

61
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:29,920
it's a subset of usb for those who know

62
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,040
like

63
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,518
there is a file for usb to be able like

64
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,400
to

65
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:38,640
talk to device through long cable here

66
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:41,599
obviously you don't need a long cable so

67
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:43,040
they took that out so it has also some

68
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:46,000
nice property

69
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,000
we'll see later

70
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:54,560
so why are we like using android

71
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:56,560
so long time ago there were even like

72
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,280
new linux smartphones and things like

73
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,920
this

74
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,800
unfortunately like it's not very well

75
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:04,079
adapt

76
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:07,280
for big fingers like you need to have

77
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:10,480
like all the application adapted uh

78
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:12,319
device also like a keyboard the dpi of

79
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,959
the screen is like very high and the

80
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:15,760
screen is

81
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:17,920
very small so you really like need to

82
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:20,799
adapt all the application and on android

83
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:24,720
it's already done

84
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:27,599
so the issue with that is like new linux

85
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:29,760
a lot of low level things are better you

86
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:31,200
even have package management and another

87
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:34,640
thing android is still lacking

88
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:37,280
today uh we also inherit like a huge

89
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,319
unknown code from google so that's not

90
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,720
right it's not like

91
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:42,480
uh reviewed by the usual free software

92
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:45,359
community and worked on it's

93
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,159
like more like a drop and we work on top

94
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,120
of it

95
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:51,200
and unfortunately it's also meant to run

96
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,120
properly software like google it's meant

97
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,518
one like proprietary application

98
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,959
not to empower users so that's not that

99
00:03:55,519 --> 00:04:01,760
great

100
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:05,200
but yeah still so

101
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:09,679
yeah so the android vendor wants to

102
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:11,280
like write code as fast as possible and

103
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,599
in the code guide they want to support

104
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:17,279
as many hardware features as possible

105
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:20,798
so the code quality is like very

106
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:21,518
variable in one kernel like in the past

107
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:23,679
there was

108
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:27,120
one driver rewritten three times for the

109
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:30,320
same hardware so in the same kernel

110
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:32,880
so android like takes uh

111
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:34,240
android can use a canon like that so

112
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,800
it's handled the

113
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,479
abstraction at the framework level so

114
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,639
the framework stocks

115
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:41,840
to some under attraction layer that at

116
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:43,360
the end of the day

117
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,679
use some library that does the

118
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,600
abstraction basically so it enables like

119
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:50,000
to break all the kernel api

120
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,639
so it's getting better now with a treble

121
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,720
and

122
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:54,320
generic kernel image from google but we

123
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,479
are still not there

124
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:57,440
and it's just like you can still like

125
00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:00,880
bike stuff

126
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:03,759
like that so uh

127
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,320
this is also uh around like some people

128
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:06,160
from the

129
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:08,639
freyan open source community do like

130
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:11,039
they don't like bad code quality

131
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:12,400
but like even if the code is bad like if

132
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:16,080
the vendor publish it

133
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:18,080
uh we can still like uh like clean it up

134
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,599
like for instance in the linux kernel

135
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,758
you have the staging

136
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,360
area where you can send code and then

137
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:27,199
people clean it up and if it's not

138
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,199
cleaned up or worked on it's removed

139
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,840
even like you can even like if you don't

140
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,758
understand the driver add prints to do

141
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,400
reverse engineering on the source code

142
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:37,039
that you

143
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:39,039
that is too messy to understand so it's

144
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:41,680
still better than having binaries

145
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:42,080
so at the end of the day and we depend

146
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,520
on

147
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,840
that source code obviously so now we

148
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,719
have

149
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:50,960
like something that's a bit maybe

150
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:54,320
controversial we will do a

151
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:55,599
play about making like smartphones

152
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:58,960
sustainable to see

153
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:01,120
like what it looks in practice and

154
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:04,840
different point of view and then just

155
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:08,479
like slides with bullet points

156
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:08,479
so yeah

157
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:13,360
so what i'm about to tell you is

158
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:16,720
subversive yeah

159
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,720
so subversive mode on

160
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:22,479
so yeah um once upon a time

161
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,479
dave didn't want to buy to buy a

162
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:26,240
smartphone because nearly all

163
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:29,360
present-day smartphones

164
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:33,600
are kind of a stalin stream according to

165
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:36,319
justin but because of peer pressure

166
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,199
and advertising and because of his

167
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:39,160
employment

168
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:40,960
or exploitation

169
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:45,440
[Laughter]

170
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:45,440
you need to be irritable at all times

171
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,880
okay okay i finally bought the

172
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,880
smartphone

173
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,960
they bought an android smartphone off

174
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:57,360
the shelf the smartphone has a removable

175
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,359
battery

176
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:03,039
this this smartphone will self-destruct

177
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:04,400
in five years

178
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:06,240

00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:33,439
dave was happily ever after um happily

205
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:35,760
and forgot about his smartphone and all

206
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:38,880
the backdoors

207
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:41,039
i'm sorry dave night line your joystick

208

211
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,839
pill

212

213
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:59,120
okay i want the red pill

214
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:03,440
dave you've been you've been living in a

215
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:06,080
dream

216
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,720
until recently leno's kernel in your

217
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,519
phone

218
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,320
was heavily modified our informations

219
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:12,800
are scarce

220
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,880
and sometimes outdated but we deduce

221
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,640
that in 2008 the device and chip

222
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:19,360
manufacturers did that to improve the

223
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,360
time to market

224
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,959
what would care about the time to market

225
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:36,399
when most humans will die

226
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:38,479
with two degrees

227
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:40,480
so they abstract the kernel in libraries

228
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:42,399
that are often on free

229
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,160
like the like the library which

230
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:48,560
implements the modern protocol

231
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:52,079
and in some cases a backdrop too ah crap

232
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:54,800
so the us in summer yes but we have the

233
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:56,880
devices so we can still fight back

234
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,719
for instance we have greater assurance

235
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:01,680
of not being recorded but

236
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:03,120
if if you left your phone on they know

237
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,209
where you are

238
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:07,110
crap

239
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:10,720
[Music]

240
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:10,720
[Laughter]

241
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,839
you trapped me because in the same

242
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:17,600
location they know i'm part of the

243
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:19,360
resistance now

244
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,760
i don't use a smartphone so they don't

245
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:25,519
know where i'm where i am

246
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:25,519
by the way welcome to the resistance

247
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:32,160
how to fight back do i need the light

248
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:34,240
soldering iron

249
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:36,240
i have no definitive answer on that many

250
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,920
things were tried in the past

251
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,320
revolutions assassinations armed

252
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:42,240
conflicts theft strikes teaching

253
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,480
living in even more communities ratchet

254
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,079
sides and even making a bank

255
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,320
but besides remote communities and

256
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:50,640
self-management spaces within the system

257
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:52,000
we didn't get rid of the of abuse of

258
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:55,120
power yet

259
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,120
i mean for smartphones man

260
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,040
as of today smartphones can't respect

261
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:01,920
your freedom

262
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:03,920
they track you with a deadly precision

263
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:07,680
our stars hitting indicators

264
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:09,760
on 10 or 20 meters for gsm and 3g

265
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:11,359
by by but replacing more and more

266
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:13,200
non-free software by free software

267
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:15,519
limits the damage

268
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,600
we have several fully free software

269
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:19,600
linux distributions and even replicant

270
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,839
fully free android distribution

271
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:25,279
replicands almost as old as

272
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:26,959
android so if i

273
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:28,959
have a supported device with a removable

274
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:30,319
battery will it last longer with

275
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:33,920
leprechauns

276
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:36,959
not yet so yeah now we will

277
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:38,640
continue uh some

278
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:40,800
some smartphones right right right some

279
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:42,000
spiders have longer software support but

280
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,240
they have batteries that cannot be

281
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
easily removed

282
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:48,640
others are meant to be repaired but the

283
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,399
software support is bad

284
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:52,720
so we lost there are many many

285
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:54,959
smartphones being produced these years

286
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,720
you must learn that these rules are no

287
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:58,079
different than the rules of a computer

288
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:01,279
system sometimes them can

289
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:03,120
they can be bent others can be broken

290
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:04,399
uh most modern smartphones have

291
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:07,600
non-removable batteries

292
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:08,720
it's hopeless free your mind

293
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,320
do you think that the number of

294
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,079
smartphones has anything to do with

295
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:15,200
their strength

296
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:16,800
but how we're going to hang up on this

297
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,200
political system and then show these

298
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,959
people

299
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,720
what those in power don't want them to

300
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:22,719
see we're going to show them a world

301
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,399
without power the world without forced

302
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,360
rules or controls or borders or

303
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:28,320
boundaries

304
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:29,600
a world where anything is possible we

305
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:39,839
where we go from there

306
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:39,839
is a choice i live to the people

307
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,920
yeah this was not planned like five

308
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:47,040
minutes before the time to organize all

309
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:50,839
this stuff

310
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:54,719
thank you anyway yeah let's get

311
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:57,760
okay yeah

312
00:12:54,720 --> 00:13:00,639
so uh like i will get back to the

313
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,639
presentation now

314
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,439
oh yeah

315
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:11,519
so um so the the issue is that

316
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:12,320
because of all that we like decided to

317
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:15,920
require

318
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:16,480
a replicant for supporting a new phone

319
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,040
that the

320
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:20,399
phone or like tablet has a removable

321
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:22,560
battery

322
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:23,760
a replaceable battery sorry so like

323
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,760
developer can

324
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,040
like continue to support the the device

325
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:29,200
for a long term and

326
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:30,959
change the battery like even if you need

327
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:34,480
to open with

328
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:37,279
tools it's okay but if you need like um

329
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:39,360
heat heater to like detach the thing

330
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:41,839
it's like too complicated

331
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:43,199
so it also uh make the device last

332
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:45,920
longer and so on and

333
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:47,519
we can like uh it's better for up

334
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,560
screening things because upstreaming

335
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:50,959
things takes time

336
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,839
so we need the device to like last

337
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:54,319
longer

338
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:55,440
and it's better for people buying second

339
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,440
hand also

340
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:59,279
because you get like you can't change

341
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,079
the battery you don't need to worry

342
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:02,320
about like

343
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:04,800
having 80 of the battery or forty

344
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:08,079
percent when you buy three on hand

345
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:10,160
uh so if we look at like the device

346
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:13,359
supported by line address now

347
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:16,639
uh you have uh like many with uh

348
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:18,959
removable batteries still

349
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:20,560
yeah we can't see but this is the

350
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:24,638
samsung galaxy

351
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:24,638
s5 neo right here

352
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:28,639
so the issue is that we also want like

353
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:32,399
to

354
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:34,480
limit like privacy attacks

355
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:35,600
so the modem is running like fully

356
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,959
non-free software

357
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:39,440
so we want to like isolate the modem

358
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:41,199
from

359
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,959
like the system on the chip running on

360
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:46,560
orion and whatnot

361
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:48,319
so if you have shared memory like

362
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:50,638
you have known free software being able

363
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:52,959
to use share memory like potentially to

364
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:55,199
attack the android system so it's

365
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:56,839
no go we try to avoid the phone that

366
00:14:55,199 --> 00:15:00,880
enables that

367
00:14:56,839 --> 00:15:02,079
um so like we we saw before in the the

368
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:04,480
smartphone picture

369
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:05,760
uh there is in for instance in the case

370
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:10,000
of the galaxy s3

371
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:12,880
hsic bus uh between the modem and the

372
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,920
the system on the chip so it's like usb

373
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:16,800
so you may think

374
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:18,319
it's uh bad like it could act like a

375
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:21,040
keyboard but as far as i

376
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:23,360
understand is the host that control the

377
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:25,519
enumeration in this case

378
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:27,120
so the modem could still act like a

379
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:28,959
keyboard but has a very

380
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:31,519
short time to do it like when the modem

381
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:32,319
boots and the boot is controlled by the

382
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:35,839
host

383
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:36,240
he could do that but yeah and still we

384
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:38,720
will

385
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:40,079
like try to look more into it to protect

386
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:43,759
against this scenario

387
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:46,160
even if it's like unlikely some device

388
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:46,720
we support also has a my pi bus between

389
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,519
the

390
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:51,839
the system on the chip and the modem so

391
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:53,040
in that case we didn't look deep into it

392
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:55,839
but we think it

393
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:58,399
shouldn't have like dma and things like

394
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:58,399
that so

395
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:02,320
so unfortunately like if we had these

396
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:05,519
requirements

397
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:08,560
uh even like the

398
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:11,360
the galaxy s5 neo is has a

399
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:12,959
like share memory between the the modem

400
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,680
and the system on the chip so that's not

401
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:17,439
good

402
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:18,638
so remains only in the apq so these are

403
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,880
like supported by

404
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:22,800
line address right now so it's a

405
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,920
qualcomm system on the chip but without

406
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:26,880
a mlm

407
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:28,160
and the modem is separate we didn't look

408
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:31,360
more into it

409
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:33,199
yet so

410
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:36,160
the issue is that we supported exynos

411
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:40,639
device before like the galaxy s3 the

412
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:43,439
note 2 and also like some omap devices

413
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:45,519
many samsung devices so it would mean

414
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:48,160
like if we support the apq

415
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:49,440
like we we would need to drop all the

416
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:51,680
device because we

417
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:53,519
currently support because they are like

418
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:55,680
not supported by line address and

419
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:57,600
not even the sound system on the chip

420
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,880
but we want to support the device longer

421
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,839
like we have a community

422
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:03,040
that boots these devices especially the

423
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:07,439
more recent one like

424
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:11,678
s3 and not two and we would need to do

425
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:14,799
like way more work for the apq

426
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:16,559
so we didn't go this route and also we

427
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:19,839
didn't know at the time that

428
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:19,839
the apq would be supported

429
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,799
so these are the one like supported by

430
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:26,799
replicon 6

431
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:29,199
that we could support with upstream

432
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:29,199
kernel

433
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:33,600
so the s3 for instance simon shields did

434
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:36,399
a lot of work on it

435
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:37,760
and man it's like mostly upstream some

436
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:40,000
things are

437
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:42,960
many small things are still lacking like

438
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,600
i don't know like backlight control or

439
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:47,919
and some big things like the modem also

440
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:50,879
need to be abstract

441
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:51,520
we have also like the note 2 that's also

442
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,000
lacking

443
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,559
in addition to that like the display

444
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,720
panel

445
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:58,480
we would need to like upstream some code

446
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:01,600
that's already written

447
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:04,799
in that case and the like uh

448
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:07,600
not two for uh galaxy note 2 4g and

449
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:09,360
galaxy s3 4g have a different modem but

450
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,080
maybe the modem is already upstream we

451
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,320
didn't

452
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:15,360
look into it yet probably not booting

453
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:17,200
the modem

454
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,479
so if we want to make a device more

455
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:22,080
sustainable we need

456
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:24,480
like upstream linux um on

457
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:28,559
like device really support basically

458
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:31,360
because people already have them

459
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:32,240
and known however that works and can be

460
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:35,280
yeah

461
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:36,640
uh uh yes uh so we also have like good

462
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:39,520
knowledge of these phones

463
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:42,240
uh so yeah this is why we want to

464
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:44,000
support them with upstream

465
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:46,720
there's still some limitations that

466
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:49,760
would like prevent us from

467
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:53,120
like supporting this device like

468
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:56,480
for internally like ram

469
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:58,559
size like if android like requirements

470
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,400
grow too much in ram size we will still

471
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:02,639
have to drop the device

472
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:04,880
and since we tend to like drop devices

473
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:07,039
that are like the worst for freedom in

474
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:09,679
the one we support

475
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:10,879
like the non-free bootloader in itself

476
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:13,200
is a problem for that

477
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:17,360
it's also like incompatible with

478
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:17,360
upstream linux so this is a problem

479
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:21,360
so yeah i just said that

480
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:26,080
yeah so there is a u-boot part for the

481
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:28,240
galaxy s3

482
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:29,600
unfortunately like the first bootloader

483
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,120
the first stage of the bootloader is

484
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:34,799
signed so it depends on

485
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:38,399
like uh bl1 is the first stage

486
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:41,280
bootloader for exynos 4412 and it's

487
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,320
like uh distributed by odroid by art

488
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,320
kernel who does the

489
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:45,600
droid and we can't redistribute it

490
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:49,600
unfortunately

491
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:53,199
so we are like someone from replicant is

492
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:55,199
doing some research to like find if it's

493
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,799
still possible to run fully free code

494
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,160
because there's like a project called

495
00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:00,240
xboot that's

496
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,679
supposedly is able to run fully free

497
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:05,360
code on exynos

498
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:08,000
4412 but yeah we're still

499
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:09,600
looking into that and the issue with the

500
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:13,039
the stock bootloader

501
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:14,639
is that it enable cash uh like data

502
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:18,320
cache and

503
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:20,640
the mmu and like since 2003 like linux

504
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:21,520
is supposing that the bootloader is like

505
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,520
disabling that

506
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:26,639
just before loading linux or that it's

507
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:29,679
not at least it doesn't leave that of

508
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:31,360
that on before like loading linux like

509
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:33,520
for instance you boot it uh

510
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:35,600
like it flush the caches before like

511
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:37,360
jumping to linux or something like that

512
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:39,520
so

513
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:40,959
so this this is a big issue we need to

514
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:43,760
solve anyway

515
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:44,080
so then we also got like some funding

516
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:47,440
from

517
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:51,120
analyte to work on that

518
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:52,640
so now uh we have the galaxy s rebooting

519
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:55,678
with an upstream kernel on

520
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:58,000
uh android nine uh basically

521
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:59,520
uh we still need to integrate like audio

522
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,400
networking and so on

523
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:04,000
and like we we also like try to do too

524
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:06,559
much things at once like

525
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,200
making conference working on bootloaders

526
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:09,678
and

527
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,320
making like still replicant six release

528
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:13,600
so it's

529
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:17,039
uh slow down the work as well uh

530
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:20,959
yeah so future direction like finish uh

531
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:22,799
the research on bootloader basically

532
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:24,720
we also need to look into the iphone and

533
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:27,039
deliver m5 because if we manage to

534
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:29,360
support like the galaxy s3 like

535
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:30,080
fully upstream almost upstream then the

536
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:33,120
main difference

537
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:36,158
would be only the malam in it so

538
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:36,479
we would need like to find a way to use

539
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:39,679
like

540
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:43,200
a new linux modem stack to

541
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:47,440
support this and hopefully there is a

542
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:49,360
real it's a like radio hardware uh

543
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,720
i don't remember what it means but it's

544
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:53,760
the

545
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:56,400
like modem manager in linux

546
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:58,000
it's it's android attraction for the

547
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:00,640
modem protocol

548
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,840
and there is someone who wrote a version

549
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:05,360
in java

550
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:08,399
that can interface with orphaner so we

551
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,799
could like start using a phono to handle

552
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,440
like

553
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:13,840
a new linux device and probably even the

554
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:15,440
device we already swore

555
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:17,039
if we had support from the modem

556
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:20,720
protocol the

557
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:22,559
samsung ipc modem protocol and we won't

558
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,360
like really like to share more and more

559
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:25,440
work

560
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:27,120
with new lineups because like you know

561
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,760
lining up stream is more aligned with

562
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,918
our goals

563
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:31,360
like we want like fully free software

564
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:34,559
everywhere if we can and

565
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:38,158
yeah android is like

566
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:41,918
upstream is less aligned with that so

567
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:46,880
yeah so that's pretty much it

568
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:46,880
yeah uh do you have some questions

569
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:54,960
uh yeah so are you running

570
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,960
android

571
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:06,320
so the question was if we were running

572
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:09,840
android 9 on on top of the galaxy s3

573
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:12,639
and that android 9 was requiring uh

574
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:14,879
vulcan support uh currently like we

575
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:17,919
don't even have like 3d acceleration

576
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:19,840
uh we never had basically uh we

577
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:23,840
patched the system to make it work with

578
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:23,840
2d uh

579
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:28,439
[Music]

580
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:35,200
okay so vulcan is only mandatory in

581
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:37,918
android 9. it's good here

582
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:40,000
for new devices so old ones can still

583
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:42,799
use opengl es

584
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,799
so we can run android 9 with uh right

585
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:47,360
now we are using software rendering

586
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:50,080
so we have mes and it is doing software

587
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:52,479
rendering with lvm pipe to do

588
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:53,279
opengl es and it's working for android

589
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,960
9.

590
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:56,720
so it's a requirement for me for new

591
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:59,600
devices maybe in the future maybe

592
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:00,720
10 or 12 or something we'll require it

593
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:03,760
for everything

594
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:05,279
and then we have a problem we can also

595
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,640
solve it with software rendering there

596
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:08,240
is this thing called swift shader from

597
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:12,080
google that does

598
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:12,960
vulcan on the cpu we will probably have

599
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:19,840
some

600
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:19,840
it will be slow but it's a path forward

601
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:27,440
oh that would be really useful for us

602
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:29,679
because our goal was to use

603
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:31,120
meza and not with shadow as our main

604
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:33,120
software renderer

605
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:34,799
mesa has several advantages compared to

606
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:36,879
swift so if that

607
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:38,080
comes out that would be really good for

608
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:41,279
us so

609
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:41,678
maybe the question yeah so you just said

610
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:44,400
that

611
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:45,840
lvm pipe there is someone working on a

612
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:48,799
vulcan

613
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:50,639
compatibility layer on top of llvm pipe

614
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:58,879
because lvm pipe only does

615
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:58,880
opengl es right now you focus also

616
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:04,799
yeah uh also on tablets like in replican

617
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:07,840
six we support like uh

618
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:12,320
uh six tablets uh basically uh

619
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:15,439
yeah but right now we are like doing the

620
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:17,600
the part on android 9. so we picked only

621
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:20,240
one device and then we will add more and

622
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,240
more devices

623
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:31,679
that would be later so the the the

624
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:34,960
comments was that some tablets used uh

625
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:36,320
like all winner uh rock chip or am logic

626
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:39,360
system ownership and it could be

627
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:41,600
interesting uh yes of course uh somehow

628
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:44,399
winner like tablets are i

629
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:46,559
even have like some upstream support uh

630
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:48,159
so since they have like even like free

631
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:49,918
software bootloaders and some of the

632
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:51,279
bootloaders are even upstream in new

633
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:52,720
boots

634
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:54,720
it could be like really really

635
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:57,440
interesting uh

636
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:59,840
although the the main focus on the

637
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,480
replicant project is a steel smartphone

638
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:02,959
but we

639
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:04,080
we try to support a tablet along the way

640
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:07,440
as well and

641
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:11,360
yeah we i think we will so

642
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:13,200
i mean for applicant nine

643
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:16,080
from the sheets i understood that the

644
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:20,480
phone that has the best support are the

645
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:21,678
samsung note 2 and samsung s3 and

646
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:23,679
most important thing that's lacking

647
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:26,559
there is the modem support

648
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:27,360
so at the moment there's not any phone

649
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:31,120
yet that's

650
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:35,120
fully usable as a phone on replicant

651
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:38,158
with upstream canon yeah

652
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:40,719
like the question was the

653
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:41,760
yeah the comment was the the question

654
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,200
was if the

655
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:45,279
s3 and the note 2 were the best

656
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:48,000
supported phone and

657
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:49,520
then since the modem is supported is not

658
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,600
supported by upstream

659
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:53,679
the question was if there was a phone

660
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:56,240
fully usable by a replicant with

661
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:58,960
upstream kernel right

662
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,919
now we are working on it so you you

663
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:02,159
probably have like

664
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:04,400
other phones that are that have better

665
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:06,159
upstream support like the n900 but you

666
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:09,600
have 250

667
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:11,600
megs of ram and for android it would be

668
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:12,799
really complicated and really a lot of

669
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:17,360
effort probably to

670
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:20,000
support that small arm size

671
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:23,279
yeah but like the model is working on

672
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,279
replicant six oh sorry

673
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:32,480
yeah just a clarification uh the model

674
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:33,440
so phone calls and sms and mobile data

675
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:36,880
are working

676
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:39,520
on replicant 6 which is using uh

677
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:40,000
the vendor's kernel so yeah currently

678
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:42,158
there are

679
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,840
replicant smartphones that can usually

680
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:46,559
be used as phones

681
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:47,039
but it's just replicant 6 and it's based

682
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:50,080
on the

683
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:51,760
vendor journal so because the our goal

684
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:53,600
now into the future into the future is

685
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:56,720
to only support devices that have

686
00:27:53,600 --> 00:28:03,840
upstream support in linux yeah mainline

687
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:03,840
kernel that's the the goal now

688
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:31,840
how much has changed between replicants

689
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:31,840
4 and 9.

690
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:44,158
[Music]

691
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:46,960
i understand now

692
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:48,399
the the question i will rephrase

693
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:51,440
completely is that

694
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:52,959
you have a gta04 that was supported by a

695
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:55,360
replicant 4.2

696
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:56,320
that was not supported by replicant 6

697
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:59,520
and you want to know

698
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:01,279
like how much effort it is

699
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,720
so the main issue with that will

700
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:05,919
probably be

701
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:06,559
uh durham because on some of them some

702
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:09,840
models

703
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:12,080
you have 512 megs of ram on some you

704
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:14,399
have like one gigs of ram which is like

705
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:17,520
the same then the s3

706
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:21,120
but beside that it's the same than s3 4g

707
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:23,520
basically um like this one has a

708
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:24,320
yeah i forgot about this one sorry this

709
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,940
one has a

710
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:28,080
good upstream support also

711
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:30,880
[Music]

712
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:32,080
but the the modern protocol is not the

713
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:35,120
same so

714
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:37,520
i think once we have like often all uh

715
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:41,678
i'm not sure like the state of support

716
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:44,639
of this modem your

717
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:46,159
but if we can use that it should be like

718
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:48,159
pretty easy to do

719
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:49,840
assuming like your arm is not too much a

720
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:52,840
problem so

721
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:55,840
it's mainly the modem that different

722
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:55,840
than

723
00:30:12,890 --> 00:30:16,640
[Music]

724
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:18,640
the the comment here was that he was

725
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:22,720
actually booting replicon 6 on

726
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:25,840
gtazo format it's like really slow

727
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:28,960
uh yeah maybe we want comment on what

728
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:30,879
makes graphic faster yeah because

729
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:33,600
one of the possibilities would be like

730
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:35,440
the graphic that is slow or maybe

731
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:38,399
i don't know my issue is that i don't do

732
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:40,240
the hardware of the gta04 uh by heart

733
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:41,678
but are we doing software rendering on

734
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:43,440
that yes yeah okay

735
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:44,720
so it will become harder and harder

736
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:47,200
because after rendering

737
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:48,559
uses quite with a lot of ram and then

738
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:52,320
you have the android system

739
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:54,320
using a really good chunk and

740
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:55,918
on each and right version it requires

741
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:57,840
more and more ramps so it will be

742
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:59,120
very hard to support it in future

743
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:02,158
versions yeah

744
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:04,158
and the the thing also is that the color

745
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:07,600
formats that are used

746
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:08,080
from the application up to the display

747
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:10,000
engine

748
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:11,600
like if you keep the same you've got

749
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,000
like decent performance

750
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:15,519
but if you like one color conversion it

751
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,080
kills really the performance

752
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:19,919
so this is what makes like software

753
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:21,678
rendering possible on replicants

754
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:23,919
is just like keeping the same color

755
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:25,279
format yeah so replicon 6 for instance

756
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:27,200
has a lot of patches

757
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:28,559
to keep everything using the same color

758
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:33,840
color format to avoid

759
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:33,840
those kinds of conversions yeah

760
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:43,600
yeah the question was what is the state

761
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:45,439
of lima graphics driver

762
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:47,439
from the last word actually there is a

763
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:49,760
person somewhere in the room back there

764
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:50,480
that can answer you perfectly that

765
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,879
question

766
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:54,640
but the last word i got from them is

767
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:56,960
that it's actually

768
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:59,120
running i think it's it would be already

769
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:02,080
good enough for the

770
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:02,559
for replica nine somebody already tested

771
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,480
it

772
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:05,600
so somebody could boot replicant nine

773
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:07,919
with the lima driver

774
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:09,120
so it works on these devices and it will

775
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:11,840
be something we'll do

776
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:13,840
uh afterwards right now we are

777
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:16,480
focusing on software rendering

778
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:17,360
because we if we get that one good

779
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,960
enough we are

780
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:21,600
we can make sure that we can support any

781
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:23,200
device so we are trying to go for the

782
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:26,158
broad spectrum first

783
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:27,760
and then we will focus on making lima

784
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:29,919
run on these effects but

785
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:32,240
it's actually good and it seems to be

786
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:35,120
running fine and it's in there for and

787
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:36,399
and right nine the main question will be

788
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:39,199
what happens when

789
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:39,518
google requires vulcan support because

790
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:42,720
there

791
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:43,519
are the dark that lima targets cannot

792
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:45,519
run

793
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:47,600
vulcan it's not capable it's too old for

794
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:48,720
for that it has a non-unified

795
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:52,879
architecture and

796
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:55,840
lots of problems so

797
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:57,679
i can almost show you that on on replica

798
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:59,039
9 we will have it

799
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:00,960
being used so we will have a fast

800
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:01,519
graphics performance i cannot tell you

801
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:04,480
about the

802
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:05,360
after that there was a question down

803
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:08,320
there i guess

804
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:08,320
maybe just a comment

805
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:12,320
have some yeah trying to use android on

806
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:13,840
it and there was a report that it was

807
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,559
working and there were some remaining

808
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:16,559
bugs

809
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:18,639
and we simply fixed one of them and that

810
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:19,279
user replied that it's actually working

811
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,960
now

812
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:25,840
we also fixed a lot of other bugs for

813
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:25,840
the mesa 28.0 release

814
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:37,760
so the comment was that it's like it was

815
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:39,840
it started being usable on android and

816
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:42,559
that more and more bugs are fixed so we

817
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:42,559
should try it

818
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:49,519
you mentioned do you know whether other

819
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:49,519
people are in groups

820
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:58,159
i don't know i didn't hear of it so

821
00:33:55,279 --> 00:34:00,480
i don't know the question was if line

822
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:03,279
androids was working on the pine phone

823
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:05,120
or the android distribution we've seen a

824
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:06,720
lot of work from people from post market

825
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:09,040
os and

826
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:10,159
uberports and that are trying to run new

827
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:12,239
linux

828
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:14,320
we haven't seen efforts from people

829
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:16,399
trying to run android on it

830
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:18,480
that's something we would like to do but

831
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:20,799
right now we are focusing on the s3

832
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:22,000
then once we have this one stable we'll

833
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:25,119
probably go for that

834
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:28,000
but this the team is too small to do

835
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:30,159
that right now and like when when it

836
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,280
will be like fully working on the s3 we

837
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:34,560
will probably like

838
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:36,320
look for collaboration for me doing

839
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:37,759
maintenance of the code because it could

840
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:39,359
support a lot of device

841
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:41,919
including device we don't want to

842
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:44,719
support like with modem that are

843
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:45,918
aren't isolated so their community might

844
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:48,480
be interested

845
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:50,399
so i don't know the point here is

846
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:53,040
replicant will only try to focus on

847
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:54,239
devices that we feel are the best we

848
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,040
