1
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:17,039
and he will be talking about

2
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:18,960
building confidence in security

3
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,800
hey how you doing can you hear me in the

4
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,160
back sorry my voice is a little bit uh

5
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,400
rough

6
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,840
make sure you're like i was already

7
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,799
checked that but i think they're just

8
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,000
recording it i don't think it's

9
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:31,199
amplified

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,480
so can you hear me okay

11
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:34,800
unless you can't answer that because you

12
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:36,239
couldn't hear me um anyway so yes i'm

13
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,239
jeff mccaffrey i work at github

14
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:39,760
uh do a bunch of stuff in supply chain

15
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:41,199
management and helping people secure

16
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,879
their use of open source

17
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,800
and just you know the great the

18
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:46,320
proceeding talks have said a lot of uh

19
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,839
good groundwork for this

20
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,600
i'm just going to give you you know sort

21
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,840
of my perspective on it

22
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,280
um you know we've got these components

23
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,960
right everybody's got these little lego

24
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,039
pieces which are the greatest thing

25
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,160
i've got apis you can plug into you can

26
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:58,879
connect them to build lots of great

27
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,559
stuff

28
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:02,239
and some of these have great big

29
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:03,440
ecosystems where everybody's help

30
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:05,438
everybody's around there's lots of

31
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:07,280
support for the component there's lots

32
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:09,919
of components in the ecosystem

33
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,880
and some you know like not so much so

34
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,439
you're not really sure

35
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,000
what's going on in that ecosystem some

36
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:15,919
are

37
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,439
very well organized they've got lots of

38
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,040
you know the registries are well

39
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:20,479
maintained and organized you can find

40
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:25,119
the information about them

41
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:25,119
etc and some not so much

42
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:29,360
some ecosystems have tons of people

43
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,560
around to help you understand what's

44
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,079
going on with your pack

45
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,880
the package you're using or other

46
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:37,119
packages there's lots of information etc

47
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,640
and some kind of leave everything up to

48
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:40,400
yourself you've got to figure it out

49
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,479
read the doc and and figure out what's

50
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,479
going on

51
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:45,920
some ecosystems are really safe they're

52
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:47,439
well you know got very well demarcated

53
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,040
you know constructions happening here

54
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:51,758
this is a good place to be

55
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,240
all that sort of stuff and others you

56
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:54,000
know have

57
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:56,000
cute unicorns but they've actually got

58
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,600
like trojan people inside right so it's

59
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,479
really unclear what's what's actually

60
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,000
going on there

61
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:03,280
the thing that all of these have in

62
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,000
common and for the most part

63
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,719
is they allow you to build really cool

64
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,160
things

65
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:10,000
they've got all these pieces you can

66
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,560
build on top of what other folks have

67
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,640
done

68
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,000
put together the really amazing things

69
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,920
that you know that are

70
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,040
solve your problem or appeal to your

71
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,440
scenarios

72
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,560
this is actually lego and i can't quite

73
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,840
tell the scale

74
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,840
but it seems quite large

75
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:30,400
so poor understanding of what's going on

76
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:32,000
in these ecosystems whether it's because

77
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,879
they're so vast or because they're

78
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,319
well not well managed etc can lead to a

79
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:38,160
bunch of problems right

80
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:39,440
failure to comply with simple licensing

81
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:42,319
obligations

82
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:44,239
um a profound sense of actual or or

83
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:46,399
perceived insecurity not knowing what

84
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:48,480
vulnerabilities you're being exposed to

85
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,760
and for you a general feeling of

86
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,760
adequacy

87
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:53,280
and lack of confidence if you don't get

88
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:55,679
the trend the thread here

89
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,440
it's like the self-help guides anybody

90
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,200
know tony robbins you know try to be the

91
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:02,239
best you can be

92
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:04,560
so i developed this idea that uh

93
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:06,879
like uh it's a north american thing

94
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,640
maybe cosmopolitan magazine has these

95
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:09,840
these things you can read you know ten

96
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,760
questions that will help you with your

97
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,519
dating life and help understand your

98
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:16,239
build self-confidence and everything

99
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:18,640
so i developed this theory that we could

100
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:19,680
have this idea of a dependency

101
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,839
management quotient

102
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,040
like your emotional you know your your

103
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,760
emotional iq

104
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:27,599
it's your dependency management iq so

105
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,200
this is actually a participatory thing

106
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:32,480
you all should probably have a piece of

107
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:34,079
paper that was given out earlier first

108
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,518
for your survey and everything so go

109
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,280
along there's a bunch of questions i

110
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:38,560
want you to keep track of your answers

111
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,080
to these questions

112
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,599
and you just have to count them you

113
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,400
don't have to like remember words or

114
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:44,560
anything

115
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,799
so just count up what you you know what

116
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:49,840
you answer what appeals to you

117
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:51,599
so the first question my manager

118
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,760
my package manager won't tell me what it

119
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:56,079
did last night and that bothers me

120
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:58,000
so if that's you know count that as one

121
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,560
if you agree with that if that resonates

122
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,599
with you

123
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,799
otherwise just don't count it at all

124
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:05,200
i have trouble understanding the

125
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:08,239
packages around me

126
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:09,920
okay so again count one if you know i

127
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:12,640
often have a sense of deja vu in looking

128
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,640
at packages

129
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:18,079
i feel crushed by the debt of the

130
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,079
packages i use

131
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:23,199
you can relate this to like your family

132
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:23,199
your friends whatever

133
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:30,080
when packages cough i sneeze

134
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,280
but wait there's more oh hang on there

135
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,359
we go

136
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:36,239
i depend on packages i don't know and

137
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,240
i'm okay with that

138
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:43,600
i often don't know what i'm supposed to

139
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:45,520
do

140
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,199
i'm powerless to change the packages

141
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:49,120
around me

142
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:50,240
are you slowly sinking in your seats and

143
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,600
feeling like less

144
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,800
confident about yourself so that's the

145
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,520
problem right we're lacking this

146
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,199
confidence

147
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,520
in engaging in the package management

148
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:59,360
ecosystem

149
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:02,719
i may be paranoid but that doesn't mean

150
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,720
my packages aren't vulnerable

151
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,560
and finally i'm overrun by packages i

152
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,560
didn't know i needed

153
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,880
oh wait that's not finally sorry there's

154
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,880
one more

155
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,680
all right so

156
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:23,919
if you scored five or higher on that you

157
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,840
may be suffering from packaged knowledge

158
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:28,400
gap syndrome or packages

159
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:30,159
for short so who had five or more come

160
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,440
on it's a safe space this is you know

161
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,080
code of conduct

162
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,800
okay great so both were honest that's

163
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,359
cool and

164
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,720
self-aware these are first steps right

165
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,759
the first step

166
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:45,440
the treatment for this syndrome is

167
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:47,600
regular use of tools strong dose of data

168
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,960
followed by progressive automation so

169
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,560
the first step is knowing

170
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,000
right that's the first step knowing that

171
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:55,120
you have a problem

172
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:58,400
is the is the first thing all right so

173
00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:00,319
this now is like for knowing what you do

174
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,000
if you've got if you're a normal package

175
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:04,000
management ecosystem or in a

176
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,520
normal normal ecosystem you've got

177
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,479
hundreds of dependencies you know the

178
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,880
earlier talks

179
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:10,400
get research about how how much how big

180
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:12,479
the dependency graph was

181
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,758
uh some stats that i saw you know

182
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:16,719
working at github

183
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:18,840
uh it's like 180 dependencies in your

184
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:22,319
average

185
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:25,440
ecosystem uh there is the top 50

186
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:28,479
packages are dependent on by 3.6

187
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:31,199
million other packages right

188
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:31,680
the scope of this graph is massive and

189
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:33,440
so

190
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,800
you need automated tools to help you

191
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,919
understand this there's a whole bunch of

192
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,400
different tools and we'll talk about

193
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:40,318
those in a second

194
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:42,400
but you know you run your package who

195
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:43,520
runs a package in a package management

196
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,159
ecosystem

197
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,280
where the resolver does dynamic code

198
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:50,319
execution

199
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:51,520
at resolve time come on now you've got

200
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:53,520
to right yeah so

201
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,120
somebody a few honest people here right

202
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:57,198
so this means that when you run

203
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:59,120
you know whatever the install the

204
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:01,280
command is

205
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,520
it actually goes and runs code to figure

206
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:05,039
out what packages it's going to install

207
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,560
right this is really challenging because

208
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:07,520
now how do you understand what you're

209
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,680
actually going to be using

210
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:11,280
until you're actually using it and so

211
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:14,160
there's this problem we have

212
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:15,039
with build time no sorry package

213
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,039
managers

214
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:18,719
not dumping the res the results of the

215
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:20,159
resolution so they don't tell you what's

216
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,199
going on in the system so you can't

217
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,960
really do

218
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:26,479
decent understanding get a decent

219
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:29,599
understanding and do decent inventory

220
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:30,479
so using detection tools cool lock files

221
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:32,240
if you've got them

222
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:33,680
right so if your ecosystem has lock

223
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,880
files so keep control

224
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:38,560
take control over your your dependencies

225
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,800
and maintain the inventory of what

226
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:43,039
you're doing in some sort of searchable

227
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,080
system so you can actually now you know

228
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:46,080
you've got these thousands

229
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:48,240
of dependencies you can actually go and

230
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:51,680
correlate that dependency information

231
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:54,080
to vulnerability data to licensing data

232
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,919
and so forth so there's a bunch of

233
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,800
different tools available uh thomas in

234
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:58,960
the front here is

235
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,919
mentioned open source review toolkit

236
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,239
previously

237
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:03,840
tools like scan code and fossology do

238
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,520
great a great job of

239
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,119
discovering both components but also

240
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,479
licenses in the software that you're

241
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,120
using etc

242
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:13,120
and software 360 itself does a great job

243
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,160
of inventorying and maintaining an

244
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,759
inventory

245
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,520
of the components you're using and

246
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:18,639
antenna does a good job of detecting

247
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,159
them

248
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:21,680
a bunch of commercial offerings i won't

249
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:24,240
go into

250
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,120
but the key point here is get something

251
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,759
that helps you

252
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,240
understand what your dependencies are

253
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:31,360
and

254
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,360
manage them okay

255
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,760
uh yes data so this is i'm going to go

256
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:40,559
into this a little bit more

257
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,439
uh knowing what you've got is a good

258
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:43,919
thing to know

259
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,480
but knowing about those components is

260
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:46,720
key

261
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,399
right so compliance information what is

262
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,839
the license of the component i'm using

263
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,240
what are the copyright holders because

264
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:52,160
when i

265
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,000
need to comply with my license there's a

266
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:55,839
good chance i need to say who own like

267
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,760
who produced the software

268
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:59,519
and uh the source location this one's

269
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:02,000
actually kind of funny

270
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:03,440
did a uh a little survey of data in

271
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
clearly defined which i'll get to in a

272
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,640
second

273
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,800
but that took around 200 000 packages

274
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:11,760
that are in active use

275
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:13,839
around the ecosystem and looked at the

276
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,120
packages to see whether or not you could

277
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:16,720
find given a package

278
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,399
could you find the actual source that

279
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,640
went into that package right because

280
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:24,000
packages are binaries in general

281
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:26,800
and it turns out that in 42 of the time

282
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,160
you cannot go in any reasonable way from

283
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,839
a package version

284
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:32,240
to the commit that went into that

285
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:33,279
package so you can't given a package you

286
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,120
can't find

287
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:36,959
what source went into making that

288
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,160
package so how can you do

289
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:40,079
you know vulnerability deeper

290
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,839
vulnerability assessment if you had a

291
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,560
source code disclosure requirement by

292
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:43,680
license

293
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,319
how can you do the source code

294
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:49,120
disclosure you can't

295
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,080
so this challenge of correlation of

296
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,080
maintaining compliance

297
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,120
information is something that we took to

298
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,040
heart uh

299
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,880
a couple years ago and started a project

300
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:59,599
called clearly defined

301
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:01,040
and i mentioned that one here and i'm

302
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:04,399
just going to pop over and show you

303
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:06,160
clearly defined for a second

304
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:08,160
you see that it's probably not big

305
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:10,959
enough for the back let me

306
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:12,240
bump that up how's that can you see in

307
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:16,399
the back

308
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:18,959
yes no okay one more let's try one more

309
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:20,160
how's that okay well that's as big as

310
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:22,800
it's going to go i think

311
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:24,399
so the idea behind clearly defined is

312
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,560
there's all these packages out there

313
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:28,079
that have poorly formed metadata they

314
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,359
don't have compliance information

315
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:31,120
associated with them

316
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,320
and we have to chase that ball right

317
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,839
there's things we can do to get ahead

318
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,360
and i'll talk about that in a second

319
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:37,440
but in general we have to chase that

320
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,600
ball of figuring out given a package

321
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,600
what the heck is in there who owns who

322
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,120
produced it what's the license

323
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,880
so we made this the system that

324
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,440
basically took a bunch of open source

325
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:48,800
tools

326
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:52,000
like fossology scan code and others

327
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:54,000
and ran those tools over the code for

328
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
the package or the package itself

329
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,839
so go out to the registry get the

330
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,440
package run these tools

331
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:01,519
try to figure out where the source code

332
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,600
is if we could find the source code

333
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:05,279
go and get the source run these tools

334
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:08,079
over it and analyze

335
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:09,360
for what's the license who are the

336
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:11,920
copyright holders

337
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,399
where's the source location located what

338
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:15,040
actual

339
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:17,440
revision and commit what was the release

340
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:20,160
date a bunch of other stuff

341
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,800
we put that all in a big database then

342
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,040
we also

343
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,800
and we surfaced that to uh to you here

344
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:27,360
so you can just go to clearly defined

345
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:29,040
and type in the name of a component uh

346
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:32,399
what should we do we'll do low dash just

347
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,399
for fun because i know that's there

348
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:38,320
and you know here's lowdash

349
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:40,079
oh i i shouldn't have done a live demo

350
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:43,839
apparently

351
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:43,839
all right well let's just reload

352
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,519
i should have just picked one that was

353
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,519
already there

354
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:59,360
all right so oh yes lent great that's a

355
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:01,200
good one um

356
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,480
so you know we can pop into eslint here

357
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,560
and we can see that it's declared

358
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,040
licenses mit we know where the source

359
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:08,399
code is

360
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:11,040
it was released uh today

361
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:11,519
maybe yesterday um you know we could see

362
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,800
who the

363
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:16,320
who the uh copyright holders are and

364
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,319
also look at all the different files and

365
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,200
see which files had licenses and which

366
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,200
ones didn't

367
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,320
now it turns out that in many cases this

368
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,920
data is incorrect

369
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,399
it's either missing or it's actually

370
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:27,680
incorrect and so what we did on top of

371
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:30,079
clearly defined

372
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,359
the raw harvesting of data is we allow

373
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:33,680
you to go in and fix it

374
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:35,120
so as a community now you can be

375
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,880
discovering that hey

376
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,560
this component that i'm using has a

377
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:40,639
missing license a

378
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:42,638
missing source location whatever and you

379
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:44,399
can go in and basically

380
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:46,560
change it and i don't know i'm just

381
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:48,160
going to pick a random other one

382
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,880
you change it here and then you can go

383
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:52,639
and say contribute

384
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,839
and when you say contribute what's going

385
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:55,040
to happen you fill out the information

386
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:55,760
i'm not going to do it because this is

387
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,160
live

388
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:59,439
um but it actually goes and opens a pull

389
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:01,600
request in github

390
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:03,440
on the clearly defined project itself

391
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,959
and there's a community of curators

392
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,800
people who care about this stuff for

393
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:08,000
whatever reason maybe they're paid to do

394
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,359
it maybe they just love doing it

395
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,720
whatever

396
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,120
and they go and they curate your

397
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,399
contribution they say oh is that mit

398
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,560
well we're here we're proposing that the

399
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:18,399
new license is mit cmu

400
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:20,800
is it really that why what's the

401
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:22,320
justification is that reasonable

402
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,839
and they so when they curate it they

403
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,639
eventually merge it like any other pull

404
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:27,279
request

405
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:28,399
and that change data now folds back into

406
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:30,240
uh the database

407
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:32,240
and so now everybody in the community

408
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:36,000
benefits from the increased

409
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:38,160
increased fidelity of the data

410
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,160
so we've done this for a bunch of legal

411
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:42,240
and licensed compliance data

412
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:44,480
we're also looking uh going forward at

413
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,839
doing this for security related data

414
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:48,160
so one of the challenges that we've

415
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:48,959
heard around security is the mapping

416
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:52,240
between

417
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:54,399
a package identity so you know whatever

418
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:57,760
this one was eslint something or other

419
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:59,839
and the cde identities the cpes

420
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:01,519
right so who knows what a cpe is you

421
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:05,279
heard that okay and you're still

422
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:05,519
happy smiling uh so cpes are these you

423
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:08,399
know

424
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:10,240
the identifier that's used to uh

425
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:13,519
identify a component in a cv

426
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:14,480
a vulnerability and the cpe definition

427
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:17,199
is is

428
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,680
relatively obscure and doesn't always

429
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:19,680
map

430
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:21,680
in any intelligible way directly to the

431
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:24,239
packages that you're that you're

432
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:25,040
actually using so one of the things that

433
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,760
we can do here

434
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,399
in clearly defined in that scope is

435
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:31,519
define them

436
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:34,880
is help crowdsource a mapping between

437
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:35,839
package identities and cpes that will

438
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:38,079
help everybody now

439
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:39,279
understand i'm using package foo what

440
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:41,120
are the version what are the

441
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:44,399
vulnerabilities for it so that's the

442
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:46,480
whole idea behind clearly defined

443
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:48,399
i think it's one of the things that you

444
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:51,360
if you're in an organization that

445
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:51,760
that needs to do compliance in any way

446
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,360
can

447
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:55,439
start using that data you can contribute

448
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:58,240
to that data integrate it into your

449
00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:00,800
engineering workflows etc

450
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:03,040
so i'm going to go back to the slides

451
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,040
here

452
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:13,439
there we go okay so it's clearly defined

453
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:14,880
uh now that's all chasing the ball

454
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,880
right and it's really annoying because

455
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,680
people keep putting out ill-formed

456
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:20,240
packages

457
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:22,079
badly you know constructed repositories

458
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,680
uh so to get ahead of the ball

459
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:26,319
there's a who knows about the reuse

460
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:27,920
software we use dot software

461
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,920
oh you should know about reuse dot

462
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,800
software so the idea here is really

463
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,719
super simple

464
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,959
there's a way of you as a software

465
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:37,279
developer an open source practitioner

466
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:40,239
to put forward the needed information

467
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:42,240
the licenses and copyrights and whatever

468
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:44,800
in a really simple way following just

469
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:46,880
very simple guidelines and being held uh

470
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:48,959
being helped by tools that keep you on

471
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:51,600
the right track so reuse that software

472
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:53,518
defines a syntax a way of putting the

473
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,360
the data in there and they have linting

474
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,920
tools and that keep your repo up to date

475
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,480
so you'd

476
00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:00,000
end up with this being like a pr check

477
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,480
on github or something that says like

478
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,240
hey

479
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,759
you just added this new file but you

480
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:05,680
forgot to put in a copyright

481
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:06,880
or a license statement right and these

482
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:08,079
are sound like

483
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,839
kind of annoying things because you're

484
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:11,359
just a developer and you want to do this

485
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:13,040
but it turns out that if you don't have

486
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,240
a license on your software people aren't

487
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:16,160
really supposed to use it because they

488
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:18,800
don't have a license for your software

489
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:21,360
so it's kind of important so i suggest

490
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:24,079
you go take a look at reuse dot software

491
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:26,240
um on the vulnerabilities side of things

492
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:27,839
so you've got an inventory of all the

493
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,880
code you're using the packages you're

494
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:30,000
using

495
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,920
but now you need to know about the

496
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,519
vulnerabilities in there right now you

497
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:36,240
can go and look at the nvd

498
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:38,399
the actual the national vulnerability

499
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:41,920
vulnerability database

500
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:45,600
in the u.s but it's kind of cryptic and

501
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:45,920
relies on cpes etc fairly hard to use

502
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,560
but

503
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:50,639
okay there's the github security

504
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:53,680
advisories database and this is

505
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:56,959
actually a superset of all the

506
00:16:53,680 --> 00:17:01,040
cves that are in the nbd

507
00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:03,680
lots of acronyms plus all of the

508
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:05,359
advisories and warnings that maintainers

509
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:08,399
have produced on github

510
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:09,520
so since uh maybe six months ago we

511
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,919
started the maintainer security

512
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:13,280
advisories program so on git if your

513
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:15,520
project's on github

514
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:16,720
and somebody tells you that you've got a

515
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,000
vulnerability

516
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,640
they say like hey there's a problem in

517
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,720
this file you can create what's called a

518
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,319
maintainer security advisory

519
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:26,640
and that gives you a private place to

520
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:27,918
work inside of github so you're working

521
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:30,160
on github still but it's pr

522
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:31,679
in a private fork effectively you can go

523
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,760
and work with your security team and

524
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:35,440
your other developers to figure out

525
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,879
what the vulnerability is and to

526
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,320
actually develop a fix you can have a

527
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:40,640
conversation and everything

528
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:43,439
and then when you've got a fix you can

529
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:46,640
publish now a pull request that fixes it

530
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:48,880
and have it create a cve

531
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,679
and that goes into the github advisories

532
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,120
database

533
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:53,360
which is available both like in a

534
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:54,799
browseable form here at that url but

535
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,879
it's also got an api

536
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:59,039
that you can call so now you can have

537
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:01,200
your your engineering system

538
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:02,640
look at say hey i'm using these packages

539
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,080
let's go off to github and see if there

540
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,799
are any vulnerabilities

541
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:08,559
right that kind of thing and then

542
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:11,679
there's a ton of domain

543
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:13,200
and ecosystem specific vulnerability

544
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:17,360
databases

545
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:19,840
um the other aspect of using

546
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:21,439
packages that doesn't get a lot of i

547
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,879
guess in the sustainability discussion

548
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:26,080
we had some of that

549
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:28,000
in the earlier talk but community health

550
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:29,678
so when you're taking a dependency on a

551
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,600
package you're actually taking

552
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:33,120
dependency on a bunch of people

553
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,559
so who remembers i guess it might have

554
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,678
been about a year ago or something that

555
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:37,840
a black hole picture

556
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:40,080
came out right that people had developed

557
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:41,360
the first picture of a black hole

558
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,879
turns out that was all developed

559
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,080
basically with software i mean obviously

560
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,200
there's the sensors and everything but

561
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,120
then there's a whole

562
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,799
mass of data processing that went into

563
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,918
doing that and that was all done in

564
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:52,879
python

565
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:53,679
based on a whole set of of python

566
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,720
packages

567
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:56,640
and it turns out when you do the

568
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:58,320
analysis of the number of people who are

569
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,120
contributing to the packages that get

570
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,600
used

571
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:02,799
to produce the black hole picture it was

572
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:05,120
like twenty thousand

573
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:07,200
it was like twenty thousand people wrote

574
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:10,799
software that went into producing that

575
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:13,039
that uh that image so there's a ton of

576
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:14,879
people inside in open source open source

577
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:16,879
is all about people and communities

578
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:19,200
but are they healthy communities when

579
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:20,559
you're taking a dependency on a package

580
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,720
you're taking a dependency on a set of

581
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:23,760
people who wrote that so understanding

582
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:26,080
that is a key

583
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:27,679
characteristic of doing of engaging with

584
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:31,918
these packages

585
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:35,520
so chaos is the community health

586
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:36,960
analytics analytics open source software

587
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:39,200
thank you

588
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,960
a project that developed a bunch of

589
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,720
metrics to help you understand what's

590
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:45,360
going on with the communities what's the

591
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:46,799
bus factor in this community etc

592
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,559
so there's a great set of metrics that

593
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:52,080
you can use uh

594
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:54,080
from from chaos

595
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,199
in putting this all together essentially

596
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:58,000
given the scale

597
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,720
of what's going on you have to automate

598
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,160
right so you

599
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:02,080
like you have to even if you're a

600
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:04,480
relatively small open source project

601
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:06,080
the set of dependencies you're taking on

602
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:10,240
is going to overwhelm your ability

603
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:11,918
to manage that manually so automating

604
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,919
makes everything much simpler repeatable

605
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:16,960
more consistent makes it auditable

606
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:19,520
etc and the one of the key points

607
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:21,520
i think for automation is automating uh

608
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,960
decisions and policies

609
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:25,200
so some of the work we're looking at

610
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:26,400
going forward is how do we make it so

611
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,080
you can automate

612
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,840
the choices that happen when you're

613
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:31,918
taking a dependency on a component

614
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:33,439
your system automatically detects that

615
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:34,880
and then tells you like hey

616
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,480
this you're taking a dependency on a

617
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,120
component that hasn't been updated in a

618
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,600
year

619
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:40,559
and all of the the developers have gone

620
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,320
away

621
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:44,559
that's probably an interesting thing for

622
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:46,399
you to know and knowing that up front

623
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:48,080
is really good as opposed to leaving it

624
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,919
to later when you found as a security

625
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:52,720
vulnerability

626
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:53,840
so by automating that that level of

627
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:56,640
functionality

628
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:58,080
you can then take all your human time to

629
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,480
to pay more attention does this

630
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:02,399
component actually fit architecturally

631
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:04,880
is this the right choice for my business

632
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:08,559
or organization or my project

633
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:11,360
etc so

634
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:13,120
the prognosis then is that if you start

635
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,520
taking some of these steps your symptoms

636
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:16,000
of

637
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:17,280
of package knowledge gap syndrome should

638
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,120
start clearing up

639
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:20,559
over you know it takes a while so it

640
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,840
might be three to six months until you

641
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:24,320
actually start seeing

642
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:26,639
some improvements but it but it will

643
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,639
happen

644
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:32,879
and that's it i'll take some questions

645
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:01,360
right

646
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,879
so i can paraphrase is like so you've

647
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:04,479
got to you've discovered a connection

648
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,919
between a binary and a source how do you

649
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,640
how can you trust that that connection's

650
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:08,799
accurate

651
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:10,799
so yeah so that's an awesome question

652
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:12,320
and in some some ecosystems

653
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:13,840
they've done a really really good job of

654
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,559
this like debian and the reproducible

655
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,399
builds

656
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:18,480
is like awesome right because you know

657
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:20,799
like there's a systematic way

658
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:22,559
of linking back from the build to the

659
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:24,639
source that these are connected

660
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:26,158
most other ecosystems don't have that

661
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,600
and that's a shame we need to make that

662
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:30,240
we need to change that

663
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,719
so as it is today like ecosystems like

664
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:33,679
node

665
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:34,559
in npm uh so when you publish an npm

666
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:37,919
package

667
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:38,480
the the actual tools will tag your git

668
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:41,600
repo

669
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:44,559
with the version number of the package

670
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:46,240
now that's good but it's not guaranteed

671
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:46,799
because while you can package something

672
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,720
that

673
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:51,520
you know wasn't actually the same source

674
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:53,200
and it's a git tag so get tags can move

675
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:54,960
so there's lots of challenges with that

676
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,480
but it's way better than the most

677
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:58,400
other ecosystems that don't have

678
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:59,600
anything at all that talk about source

679
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:02,320
location

680
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:03,600
so the ideal here is being able to build

681
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:05,918
your package

682
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:07,520
being able to have reproducible builds

683
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:08,960
not that you have to build them

684
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,799
but that there is that connection

685
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:13,039
between the binary package and the

686
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:14,240
source that's trusted

687
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:15,679
but that's that's going to be one of

688
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,799
these incremental things that we have to

689
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:22,320
get better at as

690
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:24,080
a community

691
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:25,678
is anybody here from a package

692
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:28,559
management community itself like the

693
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:31,919
people who ride in the package managers

694
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:33,440
oh good hands so uh one of the requests

695
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:35,919
i have to you

696
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,799
is so we had we had a bunch of people

697
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:39,039
together in

698
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:40,480
a discussion and it turned out that i

699
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:42,799
and you might be the exception

700
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:44,240
so don't take on bridge with this but uh

701
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:46,320
it turned out that a lot of the package

702
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:47,520
management community folks

703
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:49,439
didn't understand a lot of the

704
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:50,960
requirements here didn't really know

705
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,640
about compliance requirements and the

706
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,559
ability to get back to source

707
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,919
the ability the need for a license

708
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:56,639
there's some communities we discovered

709
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:58,720
that you know

710
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:00,240
even though the license says that when

711
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,039
you distribute this package you must

712
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:03,279
include

713
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:05,039
the license they didn't actually have

714
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:07,200
any of their tooling that forced you to

715
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:08,720
have a license in your package

716
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,799
right so if you're not doing that you're

717
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:12,880
by de facto making your users your

718
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:14,720
community non-compliant

719
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:16,880
right and that that's that's actually a

720
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:18,000
challenge so helping nudge your

721
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:21,039
communities

722
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:23,200
into best practices that help you be

723
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:24,640
more compliant more secure

724
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,320
would be awesome so that's a request i

725
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:27,679
have to you i'd be more than happy to

726
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,480
engage with how we can help you at

727
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:30,720
github

728
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:32,080
to make that easier we've got some other

729
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:34,880
folks here i get from github who can

730
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,879
help with that as well

731
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:41,440
yeah how many additional dependencies do

732
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:44,640
i take on by using the tools that you

733
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:46,080
suggest yeah well it is an interesting

734
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:48,000
question right build time dependencies

735
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:49,678
versus runtime dependencies too

736
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,200
right so some of those tools are you

737
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:52,320
know massive number of dependencies

738
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,200
because they're doing all sorts of

739
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:55,200
things

740
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,720
right so that that that definitely is a

741
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,760
challenge those are build time

742
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,360
dependencies

743
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,879
that it still they're still possible you

744
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:03,520
know challenges with those because they

745
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:07,200
can inject stuff and etc

746
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:09,600
and change etc but um

747
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,480
i mean the alternative is to not use any

748
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,719
tools at all

749
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:15,120
and do it all by hand or not do it at

750
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:17,360
all which would be even worse

751
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:20,399
i don't know do you have a proposal for

752
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:22,959
oh no i was just asking

753
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,960
stir in the pot

754
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:32,159
yeah so how do we really identify

755
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:34,158
is there a fixed firm how to find that i

756
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:37,679
thought cpe is a good idea but

757
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:38,080
is what do i use so component identity

758
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:40,159
is a

759
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:42,000
is actually a real challenge right that

760
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:45,120
it's there's syntactic ways

761
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,960
it knows the package url specification

762
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:48,399
uh that just gives you syntactic way of

763
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,039
doing it but it's an interesting

764
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,640
question

765
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:53,600
you know how many people here if i just

766
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:55,440
said i had an npm called foo version one

767
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:58,559
would know what i'm talking about like

768
00:25:55,440 --> 00:26:00,400
you oh okay i know which bytes that is

769
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:02,879
right the problem is that you can get an

770
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,520
npm off of lots of different places you

771
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,679
can get it

772
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:07,840
off of mpmjs.com you can get it off of

773
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:11,760
github you can get it off your local

774
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:14,799
um your local internal repo

775
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:16,960
wherever and

776
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:17,918
so identity for some people identity

777
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,440
includes the

778
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:21,520
repository from which it came the

779
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:23,360
registry and for others they assume that

780
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:25,279
foo version one is the same everywhere

781
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:27,760
regardless of where they got it from

782
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:29,760
so actual identity package identity is

783
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:31,840
actually a very big challenge

784
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:33,919
that most ecosystems that i know haven't

785
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:36,158
really addressed

786
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:37,840
i would love to be told how to do it

787
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:53,840
right like please it's really it's a

788
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:53,840
serious problem

789
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:07,840
thank you

790
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:21,840
uh

791
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,678
you
