1
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:09,200
the jerome is gonna start the day very

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:12,799
easy today with poetry

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:16,000
yes so uh welcome everyone

4
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:16,720
so yeah it's sunday morning and i didn't

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,560
want to

6
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,560
i didn't want to bother you with

7
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,610
something complex so we're going to do

8
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:24,720
poetry

9
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:27,599
[Music]

10
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,080
i'm jio martin and i love programming

11
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,279
but i

12
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:33,519
also love poetry and i wondered

13
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:36,239
if it would be possible to make a

14
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:38,480
poem-oriented language

15
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:38,480
so

16
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,160
the basic thing is you write a poem and

17
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,200
you

18
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:49,919
hide the program inside it using

19
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,360
some words you put inside the poem and

20
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,480
then when the poem is read by the

21
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:56,000
machine

22
00:00:52,480 --> 00:01:00,000
it executes the hidden program but

23
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,640
to do that i needed uh some kind of

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,359
machine on which uh make the program

25
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,880
work

26
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:09,680
so i need to find um some kind of

27
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,399
virtual machine i could generate code

28
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,520
for

29
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:17,200
and make the stuff execute and so i

30
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:21,119
tried to find um a machine

31
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:24,320
that would have uh that would be simple

32
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:26,320
and minimalist but

33
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,520
complex enough to make some interesting

34
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:30,559
stuff

35
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:33,360
and so um before revealing what

36
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,079
kind of machine needs it is i need to

37
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,360
make a quick

38
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:40,320
demographic census in the room

39
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,960
so the question is who in the room was

40
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,439
born

41
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,798
i wasn't who in the room was born in or

42
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:47,679
before the 70s

43
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:50,159
raise your hand all right all right

44
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,159
that's great

45
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,079
now who in the room is ready to go back

46
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,119
right now to

47
00:01:54,079 --> 00:02:00,479
the 70s sure all right

48
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:09,119
perfect so okay special effects

49
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:13,200
i have my

50
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:16,160
so now we're in the 70s and um

51
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,839
in the 70s you might remember that

52
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:22,079
something that is called

53
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:24,400
the chip 8 so the chip 8 was

54
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,160
one of the first ever creative victory

55
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,160
machine

56
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,359
it was created as a simple way to write

57
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:32,640
programs

58
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,280
directly in exactly is the microphone

59
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:38,079
working

60
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:42,319
or am i doing that okay perfect

61
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:43,040
all right so it was created as a way to

62
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:46,160
write

63
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,160
games easy

64
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:52,800
it was in a time when c doesn't does not

65
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,920
did not exist yet um a lot of

66
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,760
programming languages

67
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:58,480
did not exist yet you you would write

68
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:00,640
your program directly in exad decimal

69
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:02,799
like it's you're nearly programming

70
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:06,559
directly in binary

71
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,959
and so um there's the the wikipedia page

72
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,800
of

73
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:12,000
chip eight and so you could write

74
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:15,360
programs like pong or stuff like that

75
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,239
um and the first time the chief eight

76
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,640
machine was

77
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:20,480
announced was at that time there was no

78
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:23,599
internet

79
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,640
there was magazines so you would buy

80
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:27,760
some magazines

81
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:29,839
and inside you would have the code to

82
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:32,959
implement the machine yourself

83
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:37,040
and so we're going back to the

84
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:40,720
archive.org time machine and we'll see

85
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:43,840
the bytes magazine from 78

86
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:45,440
and inside that magazine there was some

87
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:48,480
something called an easy programming

88
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:51,680
system and

89
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:53,518
it actually explains in a few pages how

90
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,560
to program using that

91
00:03:53,519 --> 00:04:00,400
machine are you ready for

92
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:03,040
some advertising from the 70s because

93
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,760
on every page there's like wow check out

94
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,239
this

95
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:10,879
new dwarf drive mini trophy for that

96
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:14,480
it's only 1295

97
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:18,560
great so if you click the page

98
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:22,560
wow that's like

99
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:27,040
a new graphic card

100
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:29,120
okay and there you have the um

101
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,080
uh the complete list of instructions for

102
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,199
the tip eight

103
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:35,120
so there's like only 35 of them um

104
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:36,880
and you would write directly in exactly

105
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,360
small there so

106
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:41,680
the the first the first nibble it's

107
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,759
called the navel it's like four bits

108
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,120
would be the instruction and then you

109
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:46,880
would put the arguments

110
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,400
for your instruction on the next

111
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:50,400
keyboard

112
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,599
so for example if you want to jump you

113
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,080
would put a one

114
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,639
and then the three enables will be the

115
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:59,359
address

116
00:04:54,639 --> 00:05:01,759
you want to them to and so

117
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,800
the system is interesting because there

118
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:05,919
is

119
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:11,840
some easy way to make

120
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:11,840
graphics for example the the

121
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:24,400
yes there so there

122
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,560
this instruction allows you to write on

123
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:31,039
the screen there's a 64 by

124
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:35,120
32 pixel screen and by just calling that

125
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:38,479
you would write a sprite on the screen

126
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:42,800
so on the next page you can see

127
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:46,400
it explains how to encode graphics

128
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:48,639
inside the the computer and then there's

129
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,758
some coordinated screen and stuff like

130
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:51,199
that

131
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:53,840
there's the first truly silent

132
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:53,840
motherboard

133
00:05:54,160 --> 00:06:01,520
i love uzad they're very awesome

134
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:06,479
and it would explain to you how to

135
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:06,479
make some kind of space invader game

136
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,319
there's like the the walk through

137
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:13,280
diagram

138
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:14,479
i think it's it's there yeah there's a

139
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:17,840
workflow diagram for

140
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:18,880
the program so yeah you would be a child

141
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:21,919
and read that

142
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:26,400
and try to understand how it works

143
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:26,400
and get the game at the end

144
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:34,720
and there's the full code for the game

145
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:37,359
so uh you you would

146
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:39,440
type down all those bytes and you would

147
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:43,280
get the game

148
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:45,520
um it fits on only one page

149
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,479
of a magazine that's that's kind of

150
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,799
awesome to

151
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:50,560
see a complete game fits inside only one

152
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:54,000
page of the magazine

153
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:56,960
and so i thought this platform

154
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,360
allows us to uh it's easy to implement

155
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,560
and

156
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,599
i could quickly make an emulator for

157
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:06,479
that

158
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:06,479
and i want to try and see if i can write

159
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,000
some programs in this but instead of

160
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:13,520
writing

161
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:17,280
exact decimal values you would write

162
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:21,919
poems um

163
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:24,960
to do that you will need to um

164
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:27,359
for for every um

165
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,479
every instruction you would have a

166
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,800
specific verb

167
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:32,880
that you would use in your in your poem

168
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,280
and the verb would correspond directly

169
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,560
to

170
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:37,119
a machine instruction and so that's what

171
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,240
i did

172
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:43,360
and you can

173
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:46,319
you can connect directly to

174
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:48,319
reload that eu poem and try this try

175
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:52,240
that by yourself

176
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:53,919
um so i made a website

177
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,840
in which you can type your poem down

178
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:58,479
there um

179
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:59,119
this one is a bit it's not exactly a

180
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:03,039
point yet

181
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:04,960
it's uh in transition but it has the

182
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:06,159
the minimal stuff and i'll show you some

183
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:10,159
other points

184
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:10,720
later um so this one is exactly the same

185
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,599
as

186
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:15,039
the the one we saw with the rocket and

187
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:18,319
stuff

188
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:21,520
and if i hit read alright

189
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:22,720
i get the program from the the bike

190
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:27,198
magazine

191
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:29,840
and so if i understand the game well

192
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:30,479
you this is a rocket and you need to

193
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,760
shoot down

194
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:36,159
the alien by like

195
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,519
launching the rocket at the right time

196
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:40,559
and you get points

197
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:43,279
right so um

198
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:43,919
if if you miss the rocket i think

199
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:46,880
sometimes

200
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:46,880
sometimes it misses

201
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:55,839
yeah yeah it's an extremely hard game

202
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,920
oh my god i'm nearly i'm nearly the best

203
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,599
score all right

204
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:03,040
i did nine out of nine that's the best

205
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,360
score i i couldn't

206
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:08,319
do it that's the first time i get the

207
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,320
highest score

208
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:18,800
so i'm going to try some other

209
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,800
poems

210
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:28,880
let's see um so this one

211
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:32,160
this is the first one i wrote when um

212
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:33,760
when i tried to um when i tried the

213
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:37,040
platform

214
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:40,000
so uh the way the points work is

215
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:41,120
you can give them titles so the the

216
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,320
title would be

217
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:47,839
this part between dashes and then

218
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:50,640
you would have some lines

219
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:52,720
and the titles would allow you to jump

220
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:57,519
and put labels inside your code to

221
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:57,519
jump from one part to the other so

222
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:05,199
the way it works is paint here is the

223
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:08,480
verb for drawing something on the screen

224
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:11,200
then empty is the

225
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,399
argument zero is the number zero c is

226
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,519
the number two

227
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:17,839
and water is also the number two so

228
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:19,279
life is the number fifteen offender is

229
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:22,399
the number 10

230
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:24,399
uh steam is the number three and

231
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:26,880
there's a complete dictionary of

232
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:30,320
correspondence between

233
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:33,760
nouns and numbers i did that

234
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:36,880
here so um

235
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:37,279
there's numbers here and so zero could

236
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,680
be

237
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:40,640
something like void dev knight black

238
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,920
holes

239
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:46,560
uh emptiness and something and

240
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,839
uh there's like elements for every

241
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:50,399
number

242
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:52,640
so you you can write a poem using

243
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:55,680
elements of nature and stuff like that

244
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:56,480
and that would translate into uh machine

245
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:00,479
codes

246
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:03,839
and passing arguments to functions um

247
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:07,200
so if i try this one it should

248
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:09,680
do something like yeah so um

249
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,680
it uh it goes through all the lines

250
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:15,519
putting a random

251
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:18,640
one or zero on the screen

252
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:23,600
yes and

253
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:23,600
another one i'm kind of

254
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:32,720
this this one is fun too

255
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:36,160
so this one

256
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:37,040
is a bit longer and i didn't translate

257
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:42,079
it yet

258
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:45,279
into a complete poem um

259
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:47,760
but it's a a fully working

260
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,760
tetris

261
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:54,560
so uh you can actually play tetris and

262
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:58,320
oh yes i'm going to make a

263
00:11:54,560 --> 00:12:02,560
better line and so uh

264
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,560
i could play i could play that for hours

265
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:09,519
um so um the the next step here for this

266
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:13,760
one would be to uh translate it into a

267
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:16,560
poem for example if we try to

268
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:18,639
translate the first part this is the

269
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:22,160
code that draws the the base

270
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:24,880
of the of the of the

271
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:26,560
area of the game area and so we could

272
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:30,079
replace zero by

273
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:33,359
uh emptiness and

274
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:34,160
uh one by uh by water and so we would

275
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:38,800
say

276
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:42,399
uh add into the emptiness

277
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:44,560
some water from your eyes something like

278
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:44,560
that

279
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:49,360
i'm just making this up on the go and

280
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:51,120
that is the exact same program as the

281
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:54,240
the previous one we saw

282
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:56,160
uh i could do that for every line and uh

283
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,800
try to create something interesting

284
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:02,399
maybe doing some rides or stuff

285
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:06,399
and uh that would still execute into

286
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:09,760
the tetris programming so um

287
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:09,760
so uh

288
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:14,239
the the platform is uh is pretty

289
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,880
complete

290
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:18,240
now there's uh there's like some other

291
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:20,079
things going on but

292
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,440
for example i wrote a pretty complete

293
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:24,638
documentation

294
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:26,000
like um this is the dictionary and so

295
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:28,160
you can see

296
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,040
every available verb you can use inside

297
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:33,199
the poem with all the arguments it takes

298
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:37,120
so the complete documentation helps a

299
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:39,199
lot to write the poems you want

300
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:41,440
so that you can hide your program inside

301
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:42,959
that world

302
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,800
if you don't try yourself you can

303
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:47,680
connect to that

304
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:49,439
that's online on my website and so you

305
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:51,199
can try making some claims yourself you

306
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,120
can try the the points that are on the

307
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:54,959
github page if you go to the github page

308
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:58,160
and in the poem section

309
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:59,199
there's some other points if you try and

310
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,800
so

311
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:02,880
if you make during the day you should

312
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:05,839
make something interesting you can

313
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:06,480
post it on on mastodon uh with the

314
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:09,760
hashtag

315
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:12,079
codepoetry and so uh i'm

316
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:13,600
i'm eager to see what kind of poems you

317
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:17,359
can write

318
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:18,959
with that machine so

319
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:31,839
thank you for your time and if you have

320
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:31,839
any questions and stuff

321
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:46,800
uh if you have words then don't

322
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:51,600
go into the semantics of the program

323
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:54,880
that you can just use at the end

324
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,600
so the the question was uh does the

325
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,519
rhyme

326
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,800
has something to do with the poem all

327
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:01,600
can you

328
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:02,160
use any words to make the rhymes and so

329
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:06,320
actually

330
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:07,760
yes um currently the rhymes don't do

331
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:10,800
anything inside the program but

332
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:12,639
i'm planning maybe the rhymes could be

333
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,079
encoding something inside the program

334
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:16,160
that would be interesting

335
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:18,319
uh another thing i thought about would

336
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:22,399
be a

337
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:24,839
expert mode in which um

338
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:26,480
instead of encoding the numbers using

339
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:29,120
pre-made

340
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:31,040
a dictionary of pre-made numbers uh you

341
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:33,199
would encode the numbers using the

342
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:34,880
maybe the number of vowels the total

343
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:36,880
number of vowels inside the line

344
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:38,959
for example so you would need to write a

345
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:42,079
poem with the correct number of vowels

346
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:43,439
to encode the correct number uh that's

347
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:46,959
an idea for later

348
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:48,959
um we'll see yeah yeah or maybe you want

349
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:51,839
both even a restriction or your

350
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:53,680
net form for example or limerick form

351
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:57,199
and then you're only allowed to

352
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:59,519
have these kind of programs yes so

353
00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:00,560
um the question was is there any

354
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:03,040
limitations in

355
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:04,239
the way you can write the poems and so

356
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:06,079
right now there's not a lot of

357
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:10,079
limitations

358
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:11,758
only uh using the dictionary words

359
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:14,880
that's the only limitation for now

360
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:17,519
but that would be interesting to uh

361
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:20,000
add some other limitations to the way

362
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:20,000
you write it

363
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:26,880
thanks yes so you talked about

364
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:29,440
um to share the

365
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:30,560
your creation would there be a way to do

366
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,759
some code go

367
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:36,638
but with the most beautiful

368
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:37,279
beautiful poems to solve one problem so

369
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:39,920
it would be

370
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:41,680
pretty crazy because we could give one

371
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:44,880
challenge and one way and just

372
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:48,160
give this problem and everyone would

373
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:49,600
have their own their own poem really

374
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:52,480
different

375
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,360
yeah so the uh that was a bit of a

376
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,440
question and also

377
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,560
a suggestion uh an interesting

378
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,920
suggestion it was

379
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:02,079
um in mastodon you could post uh

380
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:04,319
poems and try to have some code gold

381
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:08,079
thing about what would be the better

382
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:10,959
uh poem for one kind of code

383
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:11,839
uh you could have a program and see all

384
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:14,880
the people

385
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:20,000
trying to suggest their

386
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:20,000
