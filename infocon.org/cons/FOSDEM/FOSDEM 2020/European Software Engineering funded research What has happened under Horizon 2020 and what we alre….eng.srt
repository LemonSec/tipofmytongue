1
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:11,759
so our next speaker is going to be

2
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,480
uh luis biscay perez he's going to talk

3
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:14,160
to you about

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,320
european software engineering funded

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:19,119
research go

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,920
okay thank you very much uh to all for

7
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:23,279
your interest

8
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:25,279
in european funded research uh

9
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:27,840
as he said my name is luis busquets and

10
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:29,679
i work for the european institutions

11
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,119
specifically in the european commission

12
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:33,440
services we

13
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:34,960
are organized in what is called dgs and

14
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:37,599
i belong to dg connect

15
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,079
in a unit which is called the unit e2

16
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,840
cloud

17
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:41,440
and software and i know that this sounds

18
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,000
a lot long but

19
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,879
sorry but indeed we cover many things of

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,120
the economy

21
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:48,879
and one of these is software and that's

22
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:51,760
the reason why i'm here

23
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:52,399
can i just ask one thing to the audience

24
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:56,839
how many

25
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:58,079
of you are actively involved in european

26
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:00,719
projects

27
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:02,800
one two three four okay so those

28
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,359
congratulations because you know what it

29
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,600
is

30
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,760
to all the others uh i hope that after

31
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,960
this talk you will have an incentive to

32
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,799
do so

33
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,798
for 14 years i have been working in the

34
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:15,520
european institutions

35
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:17,680
and i have to tell you that the mood

36
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:22,399
concerning open source has changed

37
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:24,560
a lot but a lot when i started in 2006

38
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,600
my it colleagues did not want to see

39
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:29,040
open source

40
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:31,839
at all in their in their data centers

41
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,360
and however now open source is currently

42
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,280
in the institutions

43
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,640
uh the directorate general for

44
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,040
information technologies

45
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,759
is actually having an open source

46
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,759
strategy

47
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:43,680
and it's actually implementing open

48
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,920
source which has a sense because we

49
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,799
all know that open source nowadays is

50
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,799
everywhere

51
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:49,840
and you know when i compare that moment

52
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,159
in 2006

53
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,200
when the maximum achievement that i had

54
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:56,000
got was to

55
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,280
to make open source in the desktop of my

56
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,360
mother-in-law

57
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,680
well now i see that in all the

58
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:03,920
institutions we are actually pursuing it

59
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,880
well that certainly encourages me a lot

60
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,320
and what is

61
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,478
what the moot in the european

62
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:10,239
institutions and and if i had to tell

63
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,000
you what is the most the mood is to

64
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:12,319
think about the future what is going to

65
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,360
be

66
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:17,839
open source uh beyond 2020 what is

67
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,959
going to happen this uh this decade and

68
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,520
we have organized

69
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,319
workshops in order to identify what are

70
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,360
the trends

71
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:26,238
and the last one was in november uh last

72
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,400
year

73
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:30,319
and well i've put you the people who

74
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,959
came well there were people in the end

75
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:33,599
but these people were coming from

76
00:02:31,959 --> 00:02:36,000
organizations also

77
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:37,679
and it's nice to see that red hat was in

78
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,040
that ibm was in

79
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:43,760
that open forum europe arduino bosch

80
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:45,120
oh by the way what are these guys having

81
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:48,319
to do with software

82
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:50,959
bosch volkswagen how is it possible

83
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:53,040
it is because now we are seeing how open

84
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:54,800
source is responding from open source

85
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:57,200
software open source software

86
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,480
is the big brother the one well that

87
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,200
probably is not the best

88
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:02,720
way to say but the elder brother the the

89
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,958
one that started the mood

90
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,640
but what is going to happen now and in

91
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:09,519
the next decade or at least what

92
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:11,518
the people in the domain are telling us

93
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:13,040
is that open source is going to expand

94
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:14,720
far beyond open source

95
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,959
software well actually it's already

96
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,599
doing that we're speaking about open

97
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:21,120
source

98
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:22,640
hardware what our colleagues in the

99
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,879
barcelona super computing

100
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:26,798
center are saying is that okay in open

101
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:29,200
source software you've managed

102
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:30,159
to conquer everything from the operating

103
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,720
system

104
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:34,079
to the application now we have linux

105
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,920
everywhere well even if

106
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,159
my mother-in-law doesn't know that that

107
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,640
her telephone is running linux yeah

108
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:41,679
sorry

109
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,399
android has got linux inside and also a

110
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,360
lot of

111
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:47,040
open source also in but what the

112
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,959
barcelona supercomputing center is

113
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,079
saying is that now actually it has to be

114
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:52,400
expanded

115
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,319
and that not only to be expanded but

116
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:57,840
that this is going to be expanded

117
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:59,839
risk five is opening also the uh liars

118
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,599
downwards we are now speaking about

119
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:04,239
processors will also be

120
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:04,640
open and not only the open processors

121
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:07,120
but

122
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,760
any kind of hardware actually yesterday

123
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,000
i thought

124
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:12,720
this slide is not complete if i don't

125
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,599
add a 3d printer and i said well come on

126
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:17,519
because open source hardware made by a

127
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:20,159
3d printer is something that is

128
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:21,358
now doing the the lines and i started

129
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,400
googling a

130
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:24,799
3d printer in in the internet and i

131
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,280
thought

132
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,600
oh come on why don't i make just a photo

133
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:32,080
to my 3d printer that is just here

134
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,759
and you put it in the in it well

135
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,840
actually to tell you the truth my 3d

136
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:38,160
printer is now a laser engraver

137
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:40,560
but you know it's the same actually what

138
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,160
we did 15 years ago when we compiled

139
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,800
software and we had things

140
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,720
now we are doing it with hardware open

141
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,520
source is actually coming also to the

142
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,720
physical

143
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:52,560
uh world and that is certainly regarded

144
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,800
by the european institutions

145
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:57,600
on how that is going to change uh the

146
00:04:54,800 --> 00:05:01,120
industry and the worldwide relations

147
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:03,120
but let's go back to the uh to the

148
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,280
reason of this presentation that is

149
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,720
actually software engineering

150
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,880
and why i'm telling you software

151
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,560
engineering it was well the european

152
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:13,199
institutions for a long time

153
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,759
have spent a lot of money in research i

154
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:16,639
wouldn't say

155
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:17,600
spend but actually invest we have done

156
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:20,800
gone through

157
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:23,360
eight framework programs for research

158
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:25,360
and software engineering has been one of

159
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,039
the well i wouldn't say the stars but

160
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:30,000
one of the topics at least

161
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:30,320
that has been funded during the seventh

162
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,320
war

163
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,599
program uh the sorry the seventh

164
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:36,440
framework uh

165
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:39,120
program for research that lasted from

166
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:41,759
2007 to 2014

167
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,639
and with the eighth world program that

168
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,479
is what's called

169
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:47,039
horizon 2020 we have invested more than

170
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:50,080
170 million

171
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:52,479
euros in software engineering

172
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,359
but come on let's not speak about money

173
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:56,960
let's speak about

174
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:59,919
people that means around five

175
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:02,479
millennia person millennia of time of

176
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:06,240
resources of human resources devoted

177
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:08,479
to actually improve software engineering

178
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,080
and why i'm telling this it's because

179
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:12,240
it's a question of resources and to

180
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:14,080
where they have to be invested

181
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,680
actually i'm speaking here at the

182
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,039
communities and people who are involved

183
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:20,639
in open source to tell you

184
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:21,520
look uh this five person millennia that

185
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:24,639
we have spent

186
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:26,400
in in software engineering well

187
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:28,000
there's a big majority that has been

188
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:30,560
spent in open source

189
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,160
projects and it's up to you also to

190
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,000
collaborate and contribute

191
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,479
and and if you want well to to

192
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,639
participate in european research program

193
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:41,520
and and then to get funded as

194
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:41,919
uh the previous speaker said uh if you

195
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,719
uh

196
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:45,440
do something as work that you love you

197
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,319
actually will

198
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:49,120
you will enjoy and so if you actually

199
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:52,240
get funded

200
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:54,000
through the european research programs

201
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,639
for things that you like you will

202
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,680
actually uh be doing something that it's

203
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:01,199
well work or it's just because i love it

204
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,639
well that's fantastic because i'm

205
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:03,680
spending my life in the thing that i

206
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:06,960
love so it's

207
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:08,960
as if i were never working

208
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,239
and and what is the kind of things that

209
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,880
we ask when you say well

210
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,560
uh let's going to fund something from

211
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:17,039
the european institutions

212
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,599
we first look at the scope a scope like

213
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:20,880
this

214
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:22,960
for example in the latest we we do

215
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,800
one thing that is called calls and we

216
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,719
say in this call we are going to invest

217
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,840
a certain amount of resources the latest

218
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:31,360
call for example

219
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:34,960
invested 30 million euros

220
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:37,360
which means around one person millennia

221
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:39,198
of resources and and that that for me

222
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,400
it's very important imagine a person

223
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:42,880
working a millennia

224
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,679
a millennium in order to produce

225
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,280
software

226
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,960
well that's the kind of things that we

227
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:50,000
are actually uh

228
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:51,599
funding and and why we thought about

229
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,039
funding this well because there's an

230
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:56,319
increased complexity

231
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:58,159
of ict systems because there are there's

232
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:01,520
a need for increased levels of

233
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:02,080
adaptability uh because there is more

234
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,799
trust

235
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,758
security reliability okay as you see

236
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,080
this is very

237
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:10,319
abstract and and this is abstract

238
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:13,599
because our leaders actually decide

239
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:15,840
on political priorities however

240
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:16,878
we will go then to what that means

241
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,039
specifically

242
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:20,319
well in this call for example we were

243
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:23,520
thinking about uh

244
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:25,520
uh funding development tools and methods

245
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,799
for interoperable adaptive secure and

246
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:29,359
transparency software

247
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:31,199
new programming models uh focus on on

248
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,880
transparent algorithms

249
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,719
uh advanced software systems and

250
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,599
architecture and you will keep on saying

251
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:37,760
well come on

252
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:38,719
such an abstract thing what does that

253
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,279
mean uh

254
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:43,839
with me well to tell you about this i

255
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:46,720
have to tell you about the results

256
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:47,839
for example actually open source is

257
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,800
everywhere

258
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:51,600
not only i've spoken about the uh five

259
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,800
millennia

260
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:58,240
invested in software engineering however

261
00:08:54,800 --> 00:09:00,560
open source is also in many other places

262
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,839
of the research work program and for

263
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,160
example the project

264
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:05,040
rest assured is not actually in software

265
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,439
engineering

266
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,079
but it's actually in cloud computing and

267
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,560
the idea

268
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:12,720
was to produce end-to-end secure

269
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,279
solutions and they started thinking

270
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,480
about

271
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:17,279
uh uh homomorphic encryption secure and

272
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,360
clevis

273
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:22,000
technologies that could help this

274
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:24,640
actually this is a research program

275
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,560
and a research project and that meant

276
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:28,800
that during the research it came

277
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:31,040
evident that if they wanted to have an

278
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,439
impact they had to contribute actually

279
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,560
to an

280
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:36,080
open source project apache parquet

281
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,680
that's the result one of the main

282
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:40,640
results of this project

283
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:42,399
actually it's the same uh as a community

284
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,120
saying well actually we have to develop

285
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,880
this

286
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,160
let's see if actually the european

287
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:48,240
institutions are

288
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:50,000
interested in developing something in

289
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,320
this field and it's possible

290
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,080
that you're going to fund a find and

291
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,320
that you'll be able to actually

292
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:58,080
develop something on this framework with

293
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,399
the funding of european institutions

294
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,440
and in an open source way because well

295
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:04,800
let's face it

296
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:06,959
the european institutions don't like

297
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,160
one model or another don't like people

298
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:10,000
to be open source

299
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,839
but the vast majority of the software

300
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,560
that is produced under the research work

301
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:15,440
program

302
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:17,040
is usually open source and obviously if

303
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,640
we go for communities and these

304
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,319
communities actually are interested in

305
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:22,319
developing something and they say

306
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,600
well if we go in this direction we're

307
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,880
also going to receive

308
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:28,560
uh resources from the eu well it's a

309
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:31,200
match made in heaven

310
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:33,439
and we all win because uh there are more

311
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:37,680
resources to to contribute and to go

312
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:40,320
forward and what is the future

313
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:42,000
well the future research program of the

314
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:45,279
commission

315
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:48,560
is uh thinking about committing 3

316
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:51,279
million person years of work

317
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:52,800
that's 100 billion euros in seven years

318
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:56,160
there will be resources for

319
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:57,680
three million person years you imagine

320
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:00,719
that with these three million

321
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:03,680
person years what could be developed

322
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:05,280
obviously not everything is for software

323
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:07,359
actually the horizon europe

324
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:09,199
[Laughter]

325
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,800
research program is oriented in

326
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:13,600
different pillars obviously

327
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:15,839
we are researching everything and there

328
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,959
are political priorities such as uh well

329
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,800
the president

330
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:20,880
highlighted the green deal as one of the

331
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:24,319
most important uh priority

332
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:26,320
if you see in horizon uh uh europe

333
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,480
actually the next research program

334
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,519
there's a pillar on excellent science on

335
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,279
producing and

336
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:33,200
responding to global challenges on

337
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:34,240
making europe more innovative on

338
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,720
widening the

339
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,440
european research area and and actually

340
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,320
if you read

341
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,440
in pillar 2 you will find that there is

342
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,200
one that concerns

343
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:45,279
digital well of course these three

344
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,600
million uh

345
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:48,720
person years will not be for developing

346
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:52,480
software

347
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:54,880
however some tens of person millennia

348
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:56,079
even hundreds of person millennia could

349
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:59,680
perfectly be

350
00:11:56,079 --> 00:12:02,479
used in developing open source software

351
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:05,199
and this is up to actually to the best

352
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:08,399
proposals that i received

353
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:11,360
and now we go to the most important

354
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:12,000
slide for you of the the of all those

355
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,720
that i have

356
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,399
uh mentioned why should open source

357
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:19,200
communities why should you be

358
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:21,440
interested in in participating in the

359
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,760
research work program and how can you do

360
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,639
it

361
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:25,760
well actually you should regard it as an

362
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:28,079
opportunity

363
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:29,760
of course if you believe that it's not

364
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:33,680
an opportunity for you then

365
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:37,360
okay nothing happens but if you do

366
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:38,959
you will be received with open hands why

367
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,720
because first you can actively

368
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:43,518
contribute and participate

369
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:45,200
in projects through your organizations

370
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:46,320
you can apply for grants and here you

371
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:49,680
have the link

372
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:51,760
a link where you can find actually

373
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:53,439
grants that are given on different

374
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,160
subjects so if you're for example

375
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,639
working

376
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:58,319
in cloud compute or cyber security or

377
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:00,560
artificial intelligence

378
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,360
you just put in you look for artificial

379
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,199
intelligence

380
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,800
and you will find the scope and

381
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,800
challenges that will say

382
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,639
look the european commission is looking

383
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:10,959
for proposals on this field

384
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:11,839
what can you do and actually well then

385
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:13,680
you can apply

386
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:15,040
and actually get funding which means to

387
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:18,319
develop things

388
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,880
open source for uh for the community

389
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,560
actually

390
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:22,320
and also for making europe more

391
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:25,119
competitive uh with

392
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:26,079
with public funding that is the the aim

393
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,880
actually you

394
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:29,839
you're basically in equal footing to

395
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:32,160
everybody

396
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:34,399
in in europe because in the end the

397
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:36,639
european commission actually uh

398
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:38,639
uh it doesn't make any any difference

399
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:40,240
but what is also true is that you know

400
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:42,560
the power of open source

401
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:44,079
you know the power of your communities

402
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,800
and because of that you know that

403
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:46,479
actually

404
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,839
well you can say that we are equal but

405
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,399
if we are best and

406
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:52,880
we're going to win and and i'm sure that

407
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:54,880
that open source has a way to actually

408
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,920
increase its uh in the open source

409
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,920
communities has a way

410
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,680
to increase its uh its impact in the

411
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:02,800
research program

412
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:03,839
and second uh that's true through your

413
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:07,199
organization

414
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:10,320
to getting funding being granted but

415
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:12,880
we also need you as as experts

416
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:14,079
and that means that well uh don't think

417
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:16,320
that we have just

418
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:18,719
developed this scope and this challenge

419
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:21,600
for funding proposals out from

420
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,639
uh what we think in an ivory tower no

421
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,360
way

422
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:26,720
when we develop these scopes and

423
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:29,920
challenges that have to be

424
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,639
uh triggered that we do in contact with

425
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:33,279
people

426
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:34,320
that tell us what has to be done and

427
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:36,880
when we evaluate

428
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,760
proposals that we have received to get

429
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,519
the best

430
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:41,279
what we do is actually to count on

431
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:44,800
people like you

432
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:47,680
so if you want to help us please

433
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:49,839
look at the second link that is where

434
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,079
you will find possibilities to work as

435
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:53,199
an

436
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:54,319
expert also in for the european

437
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:56,639
institutions

438
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:59,600
and that would mean that could perfectly

439
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:02,000
mean one week two weeks in a year

440
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,639
uh or or even a hundred days in seven

441
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,279
years

442
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:07,120
that's as much time as you can but but

443
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:09,199
that's certainly interesting to have

444
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,880
the input from the best people who are

445
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:12,639
who are here and my final

446
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,880
slide and the second most important

447
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:16,959
which includes my email if you have any

448
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:18,240
doubt please do not hesitate i'm looking

449
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:20,638
actively for you

450
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,639
thank you

451
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,839
thank you very much luis for this

452
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:27,839
inspiring talk
