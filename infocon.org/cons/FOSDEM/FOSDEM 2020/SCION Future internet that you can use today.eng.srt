1
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,839
hello everyone

2
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:19,759
yeah so here's the next presentation

3
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,279
and mathias kowalski and camilla

4
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:24,000
sochikova

5
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:24,720
they will tell you about the future of

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,840
our future

7
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:31,840
internet yeah please welcome guys

8
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:37,919
thank you so um we would like to

9
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,399
introduce

10
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,079
ourselves and our talk but it seems the

11
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:46,320
internet has already done it for us

12
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:48,239
so we have learned things about our talk

13
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,480
our attempt will be to do something

14
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:54,640
slightly different

15
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:56,718
so yeah we are people coming

16
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,000
from a university but we are not

17
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:00,480
academics and we are kind

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,199
of concerned about whether things can be

19
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,399
at least

20
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:06,080
somewhat useful in practice and

21
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,520
an important thing is we don't think we

22
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,920
have fixed the internet

23
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:12,158
we think the internet has many layers

24
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,840
and we are trying to provide a tool that

25
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:17,840
helps in the toolbox

26
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,560
of the many tool of the many things you

27
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,840
need to

28
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:24,880
fix the internet so yeah

29
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,759
um and also our thing can let you

30
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:29,119
communicate with

31
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:29,600
more than 12 computers so let's move on

32
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:34,560
to

33
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:34,559
yeah who we are we are not academics

34
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:39,119
yeah so i'm a touch on the side i deploy

35
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,360
stuff that really works

36
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:42,720
which definitely defines me as i'm not

37
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:45,119
an academic

38
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,640
in my past i spent few years working in

39
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:49,200
corporations bigger

40
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,000
or smaller then i decided this is not

41
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,200
the way to go

42
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,520
i hate them from some time ago

43
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,280
i spent few years of my life working at

44
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:00,399
cern on various open

45
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:02,719
source projects mainly um openstack then

46
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:04,159
i moved to eth and then from eth i moved

47
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:06,960
to anapaya systems

48
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:08,000
and this is our spinoff and yeah you

49
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:12,160
will see what is it about

50
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:15,280
in the presentation and i am camila

51
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:17,120
and i think of myself as the sort of

52
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,840
person who comes to your system

53
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:21,200
and kicks it until it starts working or

54
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,599
at least kicks it until

55
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,319
the system tells us why it's not working

56
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:26,799
and

57
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:27,839
yeah i know a little bit about a lot of

58
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,480
things

59
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,959
i get excited about the new open source

60
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,119
thing

61
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:35,280
every week this week i'm very excited

62
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,000
about freebsd but i'm excited about a

63
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,959
bunch of other things

64
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,959
as well and i'm weird i like hardware

65
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:42,959
and i like monitoring

66
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,400
so those are two things that define

67
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:47,360
weird people i think

68
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,360
and this is my cat

69
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:52,399
so um let's talk about what we're going

70
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,440
to talk about

71
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,879
so we are trying to design a new

72
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,000
internet if we say it in a very

73
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:00,480
grandiose way

74
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,080
but actually as mentioned we are doing

75
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:06,640
not quite redesigning everything

76
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:09,680
but we are trying to redesign a

77
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:13,440
single one tool in the many tools

78
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:16,560
needed to fix the internet so

79
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:19,680
why do we think it might be useful to do

80
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:21,040
that and what we are trying to do

81
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,280
is going to be the first part of the

82
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,400
talk and then in the second part that's

83
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,640
going to be more

84
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,080
interesting perhaps we will tell you

85
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:31,440
about how you can use

86
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:36,080
and try out our idea

87
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:36,079
yourself so let's start

88
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:42,480
so um you've probably seen

89
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,599
on occasion the internet doing weird

90
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:47,280
things

91
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:50,879
um and um they're there quite often

92
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,799
happens that they're that something

93
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:53,920
looks fishy with the internet so as an

94
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,400
example um

95
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,119
sometime this at the beginning of last

96
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,760
summer

97
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,439
um all the a large fraction of the

98
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:04,640
european traffic

99
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:07,359
flowed like you you would send a packet

100
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:08,399
from zurich to burn and it would go

101
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,080
through china

102
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,680
and there was nothing you as a user

103
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,040
could do about that

104
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,959
you just don't send the packet if you

105
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:18,320
don't want that so yeah

106
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:21,120
the the internet as it is designed today

107
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:22,000
um it does a lot of the heavy lifting of

108
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,320
the routing

109
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,320
and

110
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:29,280
all the thinking about moving data

111
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,199
through the network

112
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,479
it does it for you and this was a really

113
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:34,160
good design

114
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:36,560
back in the day when the internet

115
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:39,600
started because computers were kind of

116
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:41,600
stupid and slow and so you wanted the

117
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:45,280
network to do the heavy lifting

118
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:47,360
um but so how it works is

119
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,320
you throw the packet and then you

120
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,160
somehow hope

121
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,759
that the routers in the network somehow

122
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,639
deliver it to the right place

123
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:55,759
and don't go through china when you're

124
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:57,440
sending a packet

125
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:59,199
for 20 kilometers and something along

126
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:02,560
those lines um

127
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:05,280
however nowadays we can actually do

128
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,960
we have more options so the design where

129
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,080
the network does all of the difficult

130
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,320
things for you

131
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,280
is one option but it's not the only

132
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,320
option now

133
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:16,000
because nowadays end hosts are a lot

134
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:18,719
faster a lot smarter

135
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,520
and there might be different pathways

136
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,080
that we could

137
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,719
take and to take a look at that might or

138
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,800
might not

139
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,919
work better but we won't know until we

140
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,000
try right

141
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:30,479
so essentially what our project is doing

142
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,960
is trying this other way

143
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:33,919
or like trying one of the other ways

144
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:37,359
that we can

145
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:39,520
do that works and

146
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,360
only reality can tell us whether it's

147
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,960
any good so that's where you come in and

148
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,520
that's why i'm telling you about it

149
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,239
so that you can try it out and see

150
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:49,840
whether it

151
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:52,479
works better or worse so our specific

152
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,880
idea is called scion and it is designed

153
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:55,440
for

154
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:57,919
route control failure isolation and

155
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,759
explicit trust information

156
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:01,359
for end-to-end communication so what

157
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:05,360
does that mean

158
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:08,960
end-to-end is the first interesting part

159
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:12,400
that means your end host so your laptop

160
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:14,318
can make the decisions relevant for

161
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,000
the for how the network delivers your

162
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:19,600
packets um

163
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,880
it also has the option to make decisions

164
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:24,319
about trust so like

165
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:26,800
nowadays your isp has

166
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:27,840
the routes from somewhere and they work

167
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,400
somehow

168
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,280
and you have no idea about that while in

169
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,520
our system

170
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:35,039
your end host knows about where this

171
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:38,560
information comes from

172
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:40,960
and can decide to trust it or not

173
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,479
and there's also a lot more emphasis on

174
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,000
failure isolation

175
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:46,318
so back in the days when the internet

176
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,520
was designed it wasn't really

177
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:53,039
meant as a highly reliable or it was

178
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:56,560
meant as a highly reliable system

179
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:59,599
but not at this scale and know that the

180
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,240
at yeah it's a lot more difficult to

181
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:03,520
scale

182
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:05,759
failure resilience when

183
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,799
things get several orders of magnitude

184
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:10,720
larger than

185
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:13,280
what you expected so there's uh today

186
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,160
convergence for in in the in today's

187
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:17,198
internet

188
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,240
can take a while and in our system

189
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:21,840
hopefully this is

190
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:24,560
better we think we it remains to be seen

191
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:26,000
in reality whether it's actually true so

192
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,400
and of course the

193
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,280
interesting part here is route control

194
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,840
and that's kind of

195
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,318
the round control aspect is the one

196
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:36,000
where

197
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:38,160
i'm going to remove my salesman hat

198
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
and i'm going to be like yeah now our

199
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,599
system is nice and dust things and blind

200
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,840
stuff but route control

201
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:45,360
is a general concept that applies not

202
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:48,400
only to our system

203
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,840
but to general thinking about how you

204
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:52,638
design networks

205
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:54,560
and that's why it's interesting and

206
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:57,440
that's why we are bringing our thing

207
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:59,280
not to sell you our thing and to tell

208
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,240
you we have fixed the internet once and

209
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:03,039
for all

210
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:04,400
but to tell you hey this concept exists

211
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:05,840
give it a try

212
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:08,960
figure out whether it suits your

213
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:12,159
application so that's what we're doing

214
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:13,599
so let me give a quick overview of why

215
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:16,240
these things are interesting

216
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:16,878
so what does it mean to have rat control

217
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,599
it means

218
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:20,960
that if you have two hosts somewhere in

219
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:24,000
the internet

220
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:24,878
you can make some decisions about how

221
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,800
your packet

222
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:30,879
gets from here to there so for example

223
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,159
um in today's internet there is this

224
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:34,240
issue with if you're

225
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:35,439
sending a packet that's on the picture

226
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,360
upright

227
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,640
if you're sending a packet from europe

228
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,880
to the

229
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:42,159
like to southeast asia or middle east or

230
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,880
one of those

231
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:46,160
usually the route that your packet takes

232
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,399
is the long way around

233
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:50,000
it goes through the us which means you

234
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:52,240
have pretty high latency

235
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,040
you can't beat speed of light and this

236
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,160
is because

237
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:58,160
it's cheaper for the isp to put the

238
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:01,279
packet to let the packet go the long way

239
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:04,079
rather than to go it go

240
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:06,080
the shorter way but pay more per packet

241
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:08,080
because that route is more expensive

242
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,600
so today you don't have a choice and you

243
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,600
just are stuck with the decision that

244
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,600
your isp made for you

245
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,959
but in our system you can make the

246
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,120
decision yourself

247
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:19,119
so for example if you're having i don't

248
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:21,920
know an important video call

249
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,040
or something like that you can choose

250
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:26,479
yourself

251
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:29,120
to use the lower latency path

252
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,680
so that's interesting another use case

253
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,000
is that

254
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:33,199
for example if you're sharing a lot of

255
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,680
data

256
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,480
i don't know you have you're doing some

257
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:38,640
research

258
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,839
you have medical images or you have

259
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:43,199
particle physics

260
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:47,120
in cern that's a lot of data and

261
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:48,000
nowadays you can only stuff as much data

262
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,959
into the pipe

263
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,880
as the pipe is wide but this is kind of

264
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:56,319
wasteful because many places

265
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:57,200
uh have backup links or have multiple

266
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,440
connections

267
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,640
that they can use for failover but they

268
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,680
cannot use it

269
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:05,600
to transmit more data at a time so if

270
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:08,640
your university has a

271
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:11,600
10 gigabit connection and a 10 gigabit

272
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:13,279
backup connection with a normal internet

273
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,440
you only get to have 10 gigabit

274
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:17,519
even though you're paying for 20 but

275
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,560
with our system you can send some data

276
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:20,560
through the first

277
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:23,040
some data through the second and that

278
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:25,439
way you get a lot higher bandwidth

279
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,800
and that way that enables you to at the

280
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,440
same cost

281
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:32,079
have more interesting or like more

282
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:34,560
bandwidth intensive applications

283
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:35,839
and another interesting feature of this

284
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:39,359
path control

285
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:41,120
is that for example let's say you're

286
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,800
doing something very critical

287
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,399
like you need high reliability from the

288
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:46,640
network for example

289
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:49,120
you're operating a drone remotely or

290
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:52,560
something like that

291
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:54,720
then it's very interesting for you to

292
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,760
have control over your network instead

293
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,920
of having to wait

294
00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:00,319
for the network to make your decisions

295
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:03,519
so let's say you're operating your robot

296
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:06,320
you're using this violet path to

297
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:07,200
to send the packets and then at some

298
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,720
point

299
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,040
something goes wrong one of the nodes

300
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,959
dies or something in two days internet

301
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,800
you have to wait for the network to

302
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:17,119
start rerouting your packets

303
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:19,359
in this network you just immediately

304
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:21,600
notice okay this stopped working

305
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,600
you switch to the yellow path and you're

306
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,360
done you have switched

307
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,839
within milliseconds and you have a

308
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:29,360
working path despite failures in the

309
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:32,399
network

310
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:34,880
so those are the interesting use cases

311
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:35,760
and now uh how does this work so that's

312
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,920
in general

313
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:39,680
and how does it work specifically in

314
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:42,479
scion in our

315
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:43,920
architecture so as mentioned your end

316
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,720
host has

317
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:48,800
a choice about the path but it cannot

318
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:50,639
make it up completely arbitrarily so it

319
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:53,519
is not source routing

320
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:54,240
source outing has many issues in this

321
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:57,279
case

322
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:59,680
the host

323
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:01,040
chooses from a given set of options so

324
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,959
it's kind of a middle ground

325
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,240
which tries to avoid the common pitfalls

326
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:07,359
with source routing

327
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:08,399
but also it gives you the end user more

328
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,320
control

329
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:11,440
like a lot more control than in today's

330
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:14,240
internet

331
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,720
um and then the advantage of this um so

332
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,680
um

333
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,639
what we do is we your end house chooses

334
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,719
the path

335
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:22,000
and then it puts the path onto the

336
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:25,680
packet so it

337
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:28,959
has a stack of hops in the packet header

338
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:30,079
now this kind of sounds bad at first

339
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:32,560
sight because

340
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:34,719
that means your packet headers get large

341
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:37,359
and it is kind of annoying

342
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:39,360
um especially yeah if you're trying to

343
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:41,600
do it high performance

344
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,639
that is annoying but the nice thing is

345
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,160
that the routers

346
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:45,839
can then just follow the instructions

347
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:47,680
that are written on the packet so the

348
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:48,800
routers don't have to have these huge

349
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:51,279
routing tables

350
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,479
we already see it in today's world the

351
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:54,320
routing tables are like

352
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,720
10 000 entries or i don't know you're

353
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,880
running out of memory you're paying

354
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,240
a lot of money for routers with a lot of

355
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:02,160
fast memory

356
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,600
uh in our system there are no routing

357
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,360
tables you just

358
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,880
have it on the packet this packet wants

359
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,320
to go to that hop next

360
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:10,000
so you don't have to think about it you

361
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,680
don't have to store that in memory on

362
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,480
the routers

363
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:15,120
but in order to make sure that the

364
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,920
packets

365
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:19,279
only contain the allowed paths as

366
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,479
mentioned before this is not source

367
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:23,680
routing so

368
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:26,800
we have we have to make sure

369
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:28,880
that the path is allowed

370
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,959
that is from the set of allowed paths so

371
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,920
what we do is we have a very fast

372
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:35,680
cryptographic

373
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:39,439
uh mac on the uh on every hop field

374
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:42,079
which verifies uh that this

375
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,120
that this path came from the isp who has

376
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:45,839
the private key

377
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:47,279
you as the user you don't have it not

378
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:49,360
private keys

379
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:50,720
at symmetric for performance reasons but

380
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,880
the isp has the key

381
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,160
you don't have it you cannot create

382
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:56,639
arbitrary paths

383
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:58,560
you can only use the things given to you

384
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:00,880
by the isp

385
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,680
so that tries to find the balance

386
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,000
between

387
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,719
giving you choice but also not letting

388
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,839
you

389
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:10,079
completely break your isp by making up

390
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:12,000
random paths or loops or i don't know

391
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:15,760
something like that

392
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,360
so yeah that's for the paths

393
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,800
now there's another interesting concept

394
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:21,040
that's also interesting from the

395
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,319
security perspective but it also helps

396
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,240
with scaling

397
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,720
and that is the concept of isolation

398
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:29,519
domains so an isolation domain

399
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,480
is kind of a sovereign part of the

400
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:33,440
internet

401
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:34,959
so you would still be connected to the

402
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:38,000
other isolation domains

403
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:41,439
but the other isolation domains cannot

404
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:44,079
affect you in malicious ways so

405
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:45,360
an example could be that a country is an

406
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:49,439
isolation domain

407
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:52,160
so now your country

408
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:54,000
has control over the routing control

409
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:57,040
over the route of trust for

410
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:00,800
https certificates for dns all of that

411
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:01,839
and some i don't know china or the us or

412
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,880
something

413
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:06,480
cannot um affect these

414
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,920
things from the outside they would first

415
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,800
kind of need to infiltrate

416
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:11,279
your isolation domain and without that

417
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,719
step

418
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:14,720
they are unable to influence your

419
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,800
routing they are unable to cause the

420
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,560
issue i mentioned at the beginning where

421
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:20,479
packets go through china when they

422
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:22,800
shouldn't so

423
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,800
that's uh that's why the isolation

424
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:27,199
domains are interesting

425
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:29,519
um and from this design from the

426
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:32,399
combination of isolation domains

427
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:34,000
and path control you get some pretty

428
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:36,800
nice properties

429
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,320
so one thing is the scalability as

430
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,279
mentioned the routers don't have to have

431
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,120
this huge

432
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:43,199
routing tables they are stateless so

433
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:45,040
they can be potentially more efficient

434
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:47,839
and you also get the hierarchical

435
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:49,680
routing thanks to the isolation domains

436
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:50,880
because you first do things inside the

437
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,638
isolation domain

438
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:54,160
then you figure out the round between

439
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:57,199
then you do the routing

440
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:58,160
with inside the destination isolation

441
00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:00,240
domain

442
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:01,199
so even if you're going like through the

443
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,440
whole world

444
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:04,719
there isn't as much overhead as with one

445
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:07,920
global

446
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:09,440
flat internet structure and of course

447
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:12,079
you have native multipath

448
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:13,040
because if you are writing the path of

449
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:15,439
the packet

450
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:16,639
on the header then nothing stops you

451
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:19,040
from writing

452
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:20,240
different paths on different packets so

453
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:23,519
you just get multi-path

454
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:26,000
kind of for free and the

455
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:27,519
and then you have the fault tolerance so

456
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,519
there's the usual things in the control

457
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:31,519
plane things notice when

458
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:32,880
routers go down and so on but the

459
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:36,240
interesting part

460
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:38,240
is the do-it-yourself aspect where

461
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,680
if you notice this path isn't working

462
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:42,800
you can immediately

463
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:44,560
within a millisecond or whatever um

464
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:46,399
switch to a different path and you don't

465
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:50,160
have to wait for the network at all

466
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:51,839
it's instant so okay so

467
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:53,759
now there will be demo part it sounded

468
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:56,320
so academic guys you have to admit

469
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:57,040
let's do something real now so we've

470
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,360
heard about

471
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:00,240
few features some of them nicer some of

472
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,160
them may be less

473
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,600
whatever you judge it so what i'm going

474
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,678
to show you in the demo i tested it

475
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,959
around 50 times before this talk it will

476
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:09,280
fail i'm pretty sure

477
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:10,000
so i'm going to show you a few scenarios

478
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,678
namely

479
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,280
one of them will be i will have a

480
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:16,319
traffic going through burn

481
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:17,439
to south ko from burn in switzerland to

482
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:19,359
south korea

483
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:21,199
you will see by default we will have a

484
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:23,839
traffic engineer to go through

485
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:24,959
china however we do not like our traffic

486
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:26,720
going through china

487
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:28,960
so we'll create a policy which will be

488
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:32,640
enforcing on the protocol level

489
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:34,400
so on the internet itself what we

490
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:36,880
designed that the traffic cannot

491
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,640
ever enter the china and we'll see how

492
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:40,400
it's enforced i will not be going into

493
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,400
details we can talk about this later

494
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,600
but you will see that you will see that

495
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,679
it just works

496
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:47,678
the second scenario we are talking about

497
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:48,640
this very fast rerouting in case

498
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:50,960
something breaks

499
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:52,640
i don't know how many people on the um

500
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,520
in here in the room are familiar with

501
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:57,039
bgp

502
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:58,879
bfd and this kind of concepts not much

503
00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:00,240
okay so for people who know this you

504
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,480
probably know this stuff

505
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:04,240
is bad for people who do not know this

506
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:06,960
do not go into this direction you don't

507
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:08,640
want to know this

508
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,160
and the first scenario i will show you

509
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:12,320
something very useful from the

510
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:14,480
traffic engineering perspective and this

511
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:17,120
and here we go a bit into

512
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:18,000
money and this kind of scenarios so

513
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,840
let's imagine

514
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,280
we want to have a traffic coming from

515
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:23,439
europe to australia

516
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:24,879
so the very first question we have do we

517
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:28,960
want to go through asia

518
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:30,640
or through us whatever

519
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,640
from the distance perspective it should

520
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,200
be something similar we shouldn't really

521
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,280
care

522
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,720
but if we go into money perspective into

523
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:39,039
business we will see

524
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:41,200
that this is much much cheaper for our

525
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:41,679
traffic to go from europe to u.s and

526
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,640
then to

527
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:46,160
australia instead of going through asia

528
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:49,039
and jumping to australia

529
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:50,960
however if someone is doing some maths

530
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:53,200
at this moment that starts calculating

531
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:54,720
distance maybe speed of light even you

532
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,000
will see that this path which i'm

533
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:59,120
telling you is cheaper

534
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:02,559
it's twice as slow in terms of latency

535
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:05,600
in terms of how long does the lightning

536
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:08,080
light needs to go over the fiber

537
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:10,399
from one place to another going through

538
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:12,639
the globe on the other way which means

539
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:14,960
depends whether we need something to go

540
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:16,320
fast or we need something to go cheap we

541
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:18,240
want a different solution

542
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:20,039
and of course you as an end user

543
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,919
currently with your laptop going to

544
00:19:20,039 --> 00:19:24,320
google.com or wherever

545
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:26,960
you cannot make this choice it's imposed

546
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:28,720
by your isp by some bunch of people

547
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:31,360
somewhere sitting and looking through

548
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:34,160
dollars at the end of friday every week

549
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:35,520
but it's not your choice so yeah let's

550
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:39,840
see how we can

551
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:39,840
how we can do it i hope it will work

552
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,760
okay so the resolution of the screen is

553
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:54,799
not super big so

554
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:56,320
let me tell you briefly what we have

555
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:58,320
so you can see we have some points on

556
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:00,080
the map so these are sites where we are

557
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:02,799
present at the moment

558
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:04,559
so you can see we have something here in

559
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:07,280
asia we have something in japan

560
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:10,559
something in china singapore

561
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:12,639
europe will have one thing in sydney

562
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:13,600
sorry i cannot show you the whole map at

563
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,840
once but yeah

564
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,959
technology in 21st century still amazes

565
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:20,240
me so

566
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:22,559
the very first scenario let me so

567
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:26,320
we are talking about the scenario of

568
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:26,320
something going from korea

569
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:34,159
yeah i cannot zoom out anymore well okay

570
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:36,799
so something going from

571
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:38,240
korea to burn and we see we have some

572
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:40,158
paths marked

573
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:42,320
and this path goes through china then

574
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:43,840
singapore then

575
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:45,439
then europe and you can see some

576
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,959
statistics so we have path with the

577
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,720
latency 150

578
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,400
bandwidth three megabits per second

579
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,919
whatever this is some traffic some

580
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,320
workload we do not really care what's

581
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:53,840
there

582
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,840
the only thing we care about is that it

583
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,639
goes through china and we do not want it

584
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:59,840
to do it

585
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:03,440
so let me just change the policy in

586
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:04,320
so a bit going a bit more into details

587
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:06,720
we have deployed

588
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,678
some routers software defined routers

589
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,679
because we are

590
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:11,200
we are in the area of sdn this is fancy

591
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:13,280
nowadays we want to do it

592
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,799
we will change configuration of this

593
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:16,559
router in

594
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:19,440
cell because this is source of our

595
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:21,840
traffic and as camila said before

596
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:23,760
it's the source it's the end host

597
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:26,399
sending the traffic deciding

598
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:28,400
how to route it so the source of our

599
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:31,360
traffic will be explicitly stating

600
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:33,120
whatever happens do not go through china

601
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:35,280
so

602
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:37,918
through this ui i will create a traffic

603
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,918
policy

604
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:41,918
so what i'm doing now everything can be

605
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:43,520
done through command line just a bunch

606
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:45,360
of json files but of course for the

607
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:47,200
purpose of demo especially at this hour

608
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:48,240
when we all just want to go home beer

609
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,080
whatever

610
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,840
it's much nicer to do is through a

611
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:54,080
through the ui just click click click

612
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:55,840
some fancy stuff appears on the map

613
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:57,520
rather than just some bunch of guys

614
00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:00,799
writing jsons in the terminal

615
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:02,400
so i'll create a path policy

616
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:04,158
and i will name it about china because

617
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:08,559
this is what we

618
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:12,240
want to do and i will configure acl

619
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:15,440
with the default policy allow however

620
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,440
i will select the

621
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:23,520
and now i'm missing the map that's

622
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:28,320
lovely

623
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,919
yes i should be able to control minus on

624
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:32,720
the whole window perfect yes

625
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:34,559
that's exactly can someone from the back

626
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:37,600
of the room tell me whether it's okay or

627
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:37,600
should i make it bigger

628
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:42,559
like this better yes but now i don't see

629
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:44,720
the map

630
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:46,480
so you have to trust me i will click

631
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:48,960
what i want to click and you believe me

632
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:52,159
i'm doing what i'm saying

633
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:54,400
so i'm selecting this router in china

634
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:55,440
and now it appeared here selected as

635
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,520
hong kong telecom

636
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,799
i do not like these guys i will not give

637
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:02,240
them my traffic

638
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:04,559
so now we can see on the left hand side

639
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:06,159
this traffic will be denied let me save

640
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:10,399
my policy

641
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:13,360
let me save it once again and now

642
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:13,360
on this router

643
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:17,760
so in the cell i will modify the default

644
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:20,320
policy

645
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,879
to use the path which i just defined

646
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:23,520
which means

647
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:24,000
avoid china i will save it and if i

648
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:27,039
click

649
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,480
save enough times

650
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:30,559
here you can see just if someone is

651
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,840
interested this is a diff in json which

652
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:33,520
happens in the background because this

653
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,639
is just a bunch of files somewhere on

654
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:37,440
the server running

655
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,840
i will deploy the config i would click

656
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,520
show

657
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:41,760
logged but i'm afraid i will see some

658
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:44,158
bad stuff there so i won't show you this

659
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:47,360
i just hope it deployed properly so i

660
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:47,360
will go back to the map

661
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:52,240
and and

662
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:54,480
yes we have the same traffic and as you

663
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:56,640
can see it's not going through china we

664
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:58,400
are avoiding this one dude here who's

665
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,279
stealing our traffic and selling it to

666
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:02,400
someone

667
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:04,000
so okay so the first scenario is it's

668
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,919
covered what i'm going to do now

669
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,080
i will revert this change because i will

670
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:10,000
need this chinese guy later on

671
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:12,639
in the next step just to give you some

672
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:16,159
heads up i will

673
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:16,640
take down this chinese router in order

674
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:20,240
to show

675
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:22,559
the fast rerouting so we go back again

676
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:26,080
we allow this traffic

677
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:28,799
and we should see the path as previously

678
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:29,520
let me zoom out this is this is a cool

679
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:32,158
feature

680
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:33,440
yes if some people do not see the colors

681
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:35,760
this yellowish

682
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,960
goes back through china so everything

683
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,559
happened correctly

684
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:40,480
so camilla was saying about this

685
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:42,720
scenario of us of fast rerouting i

686
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:44,640
bitched a bit about bgp bfd

687
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,480
so let me show now what happens i will

688
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:48,960
log in manually through the console

689
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:50,880
to this to this router in china i will

690
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,760
take it down we'll see the traffic

691
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,840
immediately

692
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:55,679
goes around avoid this node and we'll

693
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:57,918
see also on the map some fancy stuff

694
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:59,679
will appear

695
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:02,400
i hope my terminal remembers what i

696
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:02,400
wanted to do

697
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:16,320
and i hope internet is fast enough

698
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:18,320
i don't remember the numbers so i don't

699
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:21,520
know if i'm taking the correct

700
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:29,840
one down now but well

701
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:31,200
let's see live demos that's that

702
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:33,120
so docker compose because you are

703
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,480
running all this stuff in containers so

704
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:36,158
we have containers for routers for

705
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:38,240
different services for selecting paths

706
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:40,559
certificates and so on

707
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:41,440
i don't want to go into detail so i will

708
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:43,520
just take down

709
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:45,919
everything so docker compose down it's

710
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:47,440
my perfect

711
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:49,039
yeah that's that's my favorite stuff i

712
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:52,240
just yeah i like

713
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:54,000
destroying stuff yes and it's the

714
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,720
correct guy so we can see immediately

715
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,039
stuff

716
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,760
something started happening we see some

717
00:25:57,039 --> 00:26:00,320
some red

718
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:01,440
signs for people who are going to read

719
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:04,158
us later

720
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:06,240
it means that the beacons so the small

721
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:06,880
packets which routers send to each other

722
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,799
to announce

723
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:10,799
paths in the state of the network they

724
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:12,480
stopped flowing so we have so-called

725
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:14,799
revocations which tell us

726
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:16,000
no this path is not available anymore

727
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:18,080
please do not use it

728
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,039
okay let's keep this guy like this i do

729
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:20,399
not care about him

730
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:22,320
anymore i will show you the last

731
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:24,080
scenario because we are yes everyone

732
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:26,720
wants to go from this room already

733
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:27,918
i think so i will show you the scenario

734
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:31,039
of traffic going

735
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:34,559
from burn can i click burn

736
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:37,679
yes no i cannot now i can

737
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:38,559
okay so we have the traffic going to

738
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:41,200
australia

739
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:42,080
we have five megabits per second of

740
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,720
traffic

741
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:46,240
and it goes with latency around 140. so

742
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:47,520
this is the best we can get

743
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:49,279
going this direction it goes to

744
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:50,879
singapore australia but this is too

745
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:52,720
expensive if you've seen the bill for

746
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:56,080
this traffic it's enormous so i will

747
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:56,080
change the policy in burn

748
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:01,360
here i pre-created some stuff because it

749
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:04,000
would be boring to show you all of this

750
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:04,959
so i created traffic class high prior

751
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,880
and default

752
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:08,640
and the high prior means this is the

753
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:10,640
traffic which i want to go

754
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:13,039
fast it doesn't matter the price and

755
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:13,760
default it can be slower people do not

756
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:16,559
pay it's

757
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:16,960
you know best effort no sla let them do

758
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:21,840
it

759
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:21,840
i will create a path policy then

760
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:30,640
low latency go through asia

761
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:35,840
and i think i'm selecting everything

762
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,840
properly

763
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:43,520
okay i have this policy already created

764
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:44,880
so i was trying to do something stupid

765
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:49,120
of course because it's late

766
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:51,039
so i'll create a traffic policy abcd

767
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:52,399
whatever let's name it like this for the

768
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:53,919
high priority traffic

769
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:56,320
and the high priority traffic will be

770
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:59,440
going east through singapore

771
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:02,158
this will be my policy and the second

772
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:04,720
policy will be

773
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:06,480
wherever for any traffic you see it was

774
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:09,760
like logical true so this is

775
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:13,039
always always true it will be going west

776
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:14,799
and if i click save enough times and

777
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:16,320
everything deployed correctly which i

778
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:18,799
hope because i sacrificed

779
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:21,200
a lot for this demo to work we should

780
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:24,399
see exactly what we want to see

781
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:25,360
oh yes okay callers are playing tricks

782
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:27,279
with us now

783
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:28,840
but you have to believe me that we have

784
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:32,720
now

785
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:34,720
four yes so we have this traffic with

786
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:38,080
four megabits going with the

787
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:40,559
high latency path and the very low

788
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:43,439
bandwidth traffic with the low latency

789
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:44,080
going with the going by the other so if

790
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,559
i zoom

791
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:48,799
out you can see that the path which was

792
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:51,279
the fastest before it stays

793
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:52,879
and we have some traffic going around so

794
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:55,360
it goes to spain

795
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:57,440
us then probably japan if i can read

796
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:58,080
maps correctly geography is not my best

797
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:00,240
side

798
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:02,158
and then australia so this is what we

799
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:05,760
have and now the bill will be much much

800
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:05,760
cheaper customer will be happy

801
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:12,080
so yes so this was for this for this

802
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:13,840
demo okay so now let's go into something

803
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:15,600
more practical because we just show you

804
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:18,158
some stuff on

805
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:19,918
some or some ui but maybe yeah what

806
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:20,399
happens what happens next do we really

807
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:21,840
use it

808
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:23,600
like this dude from the internet he

809
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:26,799
wrote we have like 12 users

810
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:28,879
no this is not true so in fact we have

811
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:30,720
two separate deployments one is driven

812
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:32,080
by the anapaya so i told you spin-off of

813
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:33,919
eth in zurich

814
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:36,080
this is a production network and this

815
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:36,960
production network is already used by

816
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:39,199
few entities

817
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:40,000
one of them is swiss national bank they

818
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,480
have deployed

819
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,399
scion already two years ago and they use

820
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:46,159
it for hike

821
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:47,840
from their perspective this is a mission

822
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:50,399
critical traffic what they are now

823
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:55,120
deploying is a product in switzerland

824
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:56,879
for people maybe okay so i will say that

825
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:58,719
i would say something as inter bank

826
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:00,559
clearance this means

827
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:02,399
different banks in the same country in

828
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:02,799
order to send money from one to the

829
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:04,879
other

830
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:06,639
need to use a very specific protocol and

831
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,440
for this protocol as we are talking

832
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:10,080
switzerland

833
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:10,640
finance the regulations are really

834
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:13,360


835
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:15,039
crazy this is so difficult i was working

836
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,520
in the past in one company which had to

837
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:17,600
go

838
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:18,960
which had to go through the audit of

839
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,600
this whether the systems are really

840
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:21,600
compliant

841
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,879
this is crazy you do not want to do this

842
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:24,959
ever so

843
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:26,880
yes they decided to use scion for this

844
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:28,159
deployment because they feel like this

845
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:30,720
serves the purpose

846
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:32,240
another use case this is once again

847
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:34,799
switzerland and government

848
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:36,000
we have some of swiss embassies around

849
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:39,200
the world

850
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:42,240
i can recall now from my mind berlin and

851
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:45,039
and south korea they are also using

852
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:46,080
scion in order to connect their premises

853
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:48,158
offshore

854
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:49,360
with the headquarters in burns

855
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:51,360
switzerland

856
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:52,799
also what we are doing in a smaller

857
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:54,879
scale so national

858
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:55,918
we are now in a process of deploying

859
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:58,720
scion to connect

860
00:30:55,919 --> 00:31:00,559
all the universities in switzerland so

861
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:03,039
the high availability

862
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:05,918
high bandwidth and all these nice

863
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:07,600
features will be available for different

864
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:09,279
for different people working in

865
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:11,120
different scientific entities in

866
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:14,000
switzerland

867
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:14,879
and as you can see this is a bgp free so

868
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,559
yes we have this

869
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:19,039
this nice sticker coming out wrote it

870
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:21,279
like a few few hours ago

871
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:22,158
this network is not using bgp which

872
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:24,640
means you are

873
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:25,679
covered by definition from all these

874
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:27,519
problems

875
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:29,760
which were described at the beginning of

876
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:32,159
the presentation so we are not running

877
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:33,519
on top of the current internet

878
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:35,039
yes it's not running on the current

879
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:36,240
internet this is going back to this dude

880
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:37,919
from end something

881
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:40,399
yes he does it every year he's just

882
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:42,799
trashing all the talks on the main track

883
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:44,959
and then for people who want to try who

884
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:46,559
want to do some experiments perform some

885
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:47,440
research maybe you want to discover some

886
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:49,840
new features

887
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:50,880
we have scion lab research network this

888
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:53,918
is a

889
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:57,279
this is network consisting

890
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:59,519
of around 60 scientific

891
00:31:57,279 --> 00:32:01,840
institutes in four continents at the

892
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:03,840
moment we have widely deployed

893
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:05,439
scion lab backbone which is managed by

894
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:07,360
people at eth

895
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:09,440
and then in different countries

896
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:11,439
continents we have created for them

897
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:13,679
their own isolations domain they can

898
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:14,960
join at any point in time they can try

899
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:18,000
they can do research

900
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:20,320
i think the biggest con not really

901
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,640
customer but the biggest user right now

902
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:24,399
are some people in korea they are using

903
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:26,399
scion asylum

904
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:28,559
extensively they are doing really nice

905
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:30,639
research they are writing papers like

906
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:31,279
crazy they are delivering results and

907
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:34,240
they

908
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:36,720
they say scion lab really helps them i

909
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:39,360
think some guys in netherlands

910
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:40,640
i don't remember this idn maybe that

911
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:43,039
means something to people

912
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:45,039
yeah whatever some guys in netherlands

913
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:45,840
they are using this for more production

914
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:47,600
research

915
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:49,360
i think they are trying to do something

916
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:52,480
with p4 and programming

917
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:54,240
fpgas if this is something to to someone

918
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:56,559
so so this network is big and this is

919
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:58,559
something you can join whenever you want

920
00:32:56,559 --> 00:33:01,840
and you know just just play around just

921
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:01,840
discover some stuff

922
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:05,760
yeah and yeah camilla is going to tell

923
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:08,880
you something how exactly to do

924
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:10,480
about how to run this yeah so that's all

925
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:12,399
very nice what we've told you but how do

926
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:14,480
you yourself like sit down

927
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:16,239
tonight at 1am after you've done your

928
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,799
drinking and deploy this on your home

929
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:19,279
router

930
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:21,200
so that's my home router the most

931
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:21,919
important feature of course on any home

932
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:25,120
router is

933
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:28,320
ice and this is a

934
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:32,080
small passively cooled computer that can

935
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:35,678
run cyan on on like

936
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:37,678
to to test it out so it runs on any pc

937
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:38,720
the sources for our reference

938
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:42,240
implementation

939
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:45,600
are on github and you can deploy it

940
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:49,840
on a pc or in a vm to try it out

941
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:53,840
quite easily what's interesting is that

942
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:57,120
it is possible to to use scion

943
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:59,760
also for like ip traffic by

944
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:00,799
letting it go through a gateway so of

945
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:03,519
course if you want

946
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:04,480
your application to take full use to

947
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:06,559
make full use of the

948
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:09,199
fancy features your application needs to

949
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:11,918
be able to select the path itself so it

950
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:13,520
has to be scion aware but if you don't

951
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:14,638
have a cyan aware application but i

952
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:17,759
don't know you have your

953
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:20,159
video calls or you have your

954
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:22,000
not torrents streaming nowadays you can

955
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:24,800
make you can use the ip

956
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,760
the scion ip gateway to make different

957
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:29,599
choices about

958
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:31,359
ip traffic and define policies

959
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:33,440
for your ip traffic to go through

960
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:35,759
different paths in the scion network

961
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:37,119
so kind of use it as an overlay and it

962
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:40,480
was also possible

963
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:41,200
to deploy scion and ip on the same

964
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:43,679
networks

965
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:45,040
then it would kind of have cyan on top

966
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:46,879
of ip

967
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:48,639
and then if you use the scion ip gateway

968
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:52,319
then you have

969
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:53,839
ip on top of scion on top of ip but

970
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:55,599
it kind of makes sense because you still

971
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:57,200
have the path control policies

972
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:59,359
so that means you don't have to have a

973
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,839
dedicated network and you don't have to

974
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:02,720
write

975
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:03,680
all shiny new applications but you can

976
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:07,520
literally start

977
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:10,240
using it without all that extra work

978
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:11,839
and but in case you do want to write an

979
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,319
application in case you do want to make

980
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:15,759
use

981
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:17,520
of the fancy features

982
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:19,599
this is what it looks like in a hello

983
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:21,119
world fashion so it's pretty similar to

984
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:23,440
normal networking

985
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:25,680
to ip based networking the interesting

986
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:28,079
thing is you have to get the paths

987
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:29,279
to your destination you get i don't know

988
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:31,359
three paths

989
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:32,480
and then you can choose it somehow

990
00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:35,119
depending on what your

991
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:36,560
needs are you may try all the paths find

992
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:38,480
out which one is fastest

993
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:39,920
or find out which one is cheapest or i

994
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:43,280
don't know

995
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:46,000
and then you you you do a connect

996
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:46,880
but you just give it the selected path

997
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,440
as well

998
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:50,960
right now you have to give it one path

999
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,520
and if you want to use multi-path you

1000
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:53,839
open

1001
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:54,880
different connections but we are working

1002
00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:57,599
on a native

1003
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:58,480
like default multi-path thing but that's

1004
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:01,440
in the works

1005
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:03,440
yeah and we are very curious about

1006
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:05,760
people coming up with ideas of what you

1007
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:07,040
can do with a pathway network like this

1008
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:09,200
you could have some interesting use

1009
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:10,880
cases for path control i don't know the

1010
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:12,960
video calls is an obvious example

1011
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:15,599
maybe online games might be interesting

1012
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:18,160
some streaming i don't know things

1013
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:19,920
there's lots of things about efficiently

1014
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:22,000
using multipath because there are issues

1015
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:24,079
with

1016
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:26,240
how do you actually make use of the fact

1017
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:28,400
that you have multiple paths uh

1018
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:30,240
improve the network utilization there

1019
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:32,000
are a bunch of security implications

1020
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:34,078
that might be interesting to explore

1021
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,000
and from the isp viewpoint there's the

1022
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:37,040
question of okay your users are choosing

1023
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,800
paths now

1024
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:40,880
how do we do traffic engineering how do

1025
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:44,240
we define path policies that make sense

1026
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:46,560
both for our users and for us so

1027
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:48,160
we are curious to see what people do

1028
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:50,078
sorry we are running out of time so i

1029
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:50,960
won't be showing you any more demos i

1030
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:53,680
will just tell you

1031
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:55,359
what i wanted to show you so in order to

1032
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:56,160
join the scion lab research network what

1033
00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:58,880
we provide you

1034
00:36:56,160 --> 00:37:00,560
we have a very simple web interface in

1035
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:02,720
which you can register so yeah

1036
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:04,880
you just create an account we provide

1037
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:08,078
you vagrant files so you can

1038
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:10,320
just run scion inside a vm it will

1039
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:12,800
connect to scion lab

1040
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:14,079
transparently from you so effectively

1041
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,720
what you need to do you go to the

1042
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:16,720
website

1043
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:19,118
you register we do not need any data

1044
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:19,759
from just email address so we know the

1045
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:21,440
person

1046
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:23,359
so we know that there is someone behind

1047
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:25,680
it's not just a bunch of bots from

1048
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:26,880
pakistan china india wherever you name

1049
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:28,960
it you

1050
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:31,359
you register that yes i want to download

1051
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:33,599
a vagrant file to join scion lab

1052
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:34,880
you get it vagrant up that's probably

1053
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:37,520
something very simple

1054
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:39,839
for people and you um and you run it

1055
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:40,800
runs on top of ubuntu we do not do any

1056
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:43,839
fancy stuff

1057
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:44,480
inside so yeah just a bunch of scripts

1058
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:46,799
which

1059
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:47,680
which we provide to you in order to make

1060
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:49,599
it very simple

1061
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:51,520
of course if you want some more advanced

1062
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:53,359
scenario you can even build it from code

1063
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:54,079
because this is on github the links are

1064
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:56,400
later

1065
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:57,760
so yeah do us you want we provide debian

1066
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,839
packages i don't know

1067
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:01,760
i think rpms are not available i built

1068
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:03,520
them a few times but i never published

1069
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:06,240
so this is something yet to go but

1070
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:08,000
debian packages ready to go vagrant file

1071
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:08,560
built from source these are the options

1072
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:12,160
you

1073
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:13,520
you can do so yes so we have some links

1074
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:16,399
go through them later

1075
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:18,240
so we will upload the slides i think

1076
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:20,400
they should be up

1077
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:21,279
so um cyan architecture if you want to

1078
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,720
know something more about the

1079
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:24,400
architecture itself simula as i

1080
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:26,160
described on a pioneer if you are ever

1081
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:28,720
interested in the production network

1082
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:30,720
cyan protocyon is the protocol itself

1083
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:31,279
the reference implementation for all the

1084
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:33,839
stuff

1085
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:34,960
you've seen there and netsec eth scion

1086
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:36,720
apps you have some

1087
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:38,000
examples you've seen on the slide hello

1088
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:39,839
world because of course we do

1089
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,440
we won't be pasting the source code but

1090
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:43,839
if you want to see some applications

1091
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:45,200
already in place this is in the reposion

1092
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:47,359
apps

1093
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:49,279
and yes if you want to keep in touch

1094
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:50,240
with us please feel free there is a lot

1095
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:53,359
of

1096
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:55,040
a lot of ways to to contact us also feel

1097
00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:57,520
free to catch up with us

1098
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:58,240
later and i think we have 10 minutes for

1099
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:01,280
questions

1100
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:04,000
so let's go

1101
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:06,400
thank you matthias camilla for

1102
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,400
interesting

1103
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:15,839
so i guess you can share my microphone

1104
00:39:12,839 --> 00:39:15,839
okay

1105
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:22,078
so if this allows users to uh determine

1106
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:23,760
which route they

1107
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:27,280
go through the internet with does that

1108
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:29,520
involve a completely different thing at

1109
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:30,560
internet backbone level and does it

1110
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:33,839
change the way that

1111
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:33,839
isp billing would work

1112
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:39,359
yeah so um we are this is kind of

1113
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:42,000
interesting on the larger scale of

1114
00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:43,520
things so not your home network but a

1115
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:46,880
bunch of isps

1116
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:47,920
um and yeah um it's kind of an

1117
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:50,400
interesting question of

1118
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:51,280
why the isps should care and i think

1119
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:55,040
it's like

1120
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:56,720
if you as the end users want it the isps

1121
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:58,720
can

1122
00:39:56,720 --> 00:40:00,078
might will then have an incentive to

1123
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:03,040
start providing it

1124
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:05,359
right yes some of this we already have

1125
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:07,200
isps in switzerland and i think we are

1126
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:09,359
working with one in korea

1127
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:10,480
to start providing this for end users so

1128
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:13,040
you don't need to

1129
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:13,920
build anything on top if you are based

1130
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:16,160
in switzerland

1131
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:18,560
you can just in some time from now call

1132
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:20,640
swisscom tell them i want on top of the

1133
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:22,480
internet which i have at home from

1134
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:24,400
from the network outlet i want to have

1135
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:26,880
scion nate levy there and i think they

1136
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:28,960
are already working on a commercial

1137
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:30,319
offer for this i don't know for

1138
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:32,480
residential customers

1139
00:40:30,319 --> 00:40:33,839
if it's going to have a if it's going to

1140
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:35,280
be available anytime soon

1141
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:37,520
but for businesses this is something you

1142
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:39,920
can already talk with isps and they will

1143
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:40,480
be very happy to quote you on this and

1144
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,920
you know

1145
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:44,640
you pay the money they will provide you

1146
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:44,640
whatever you need

1147
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:48,880
i uh thank you for your presentation i'm

1148
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:52,160
just wondering if my

1149
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:54,079
isp changes the available routes

1150
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:56,720
to something that is not compatible with

1151
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:58,480
the policy policies that i have set up

1152
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:01,279
then i'm just out of luck or what

1153
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:03,520
happens then yeah so it can happen

1154
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:05,760
that there are no paths that are

1155
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:07,759
compatible with your policy because

1156
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:09,760
the isp makes the decision of what is

1157
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:12,640
available and you locally

1158
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:14,079
make the decision of what you want so

1159
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:16,400
yeah if it's incompatible

1160
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:18,319
you are said you get no paths and you

1161
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:20,640
have to talk to your isp

1162
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:21,920
to make them change their policy or you

1163
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:24,000
change your policy

1164
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:25,119
but it's still we think an improvement

1165
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,200
over the

1166
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:28,560
uh current internet because at least you

1167
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,359
know if they're doing something you

1168
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,960
don't like

1169
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:33,040
and you can make yourself the decision

1170
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:37,119
of okay will i

1171
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:41,440
not be so picky or will i try to

1172
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:41,440
make them do what i want right

1173
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:47,520
hello thank you for the presentation i

1174
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:48,480
have a question about the protocol

1175
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:51,920
itself

1176
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:55,119
so you defined it as a as a

1177
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:58,319
a priori definition of a path so

1178
00:41:55,119 --> 00:42:01,599
what i understand you design your path

1179
00:41:58,319 --> 00:42:04,720
in the same way as store does it

1180
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:08,000
and what you do is you always have

1181
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:10,560
one path so you are exposed to a problem

1182
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,440
the same problem which which cities have

1183
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:13,599
with roads

1184
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:14,560
because people tend to choose the same

1185
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:17,599
roads

1186
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:20,640
over and over again so this way

1187
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:22,079
you you lure people into

1188
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:24,799
thinking that they are designing

1189
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:28,960
something better by themselves

1190
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:31,440
which actually is they actually perform

1191
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:33,119
what is performed currently by routers

1192
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:35,760
of isp

1193
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:37,119
so first of all people are becoming

1194
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:39,839
routers themselves

1195
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:40,560
well business people and the second of

1196
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:44,960
all

1197
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:46,640
uh fixed paths force you to send your

1198
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:48,800
configuration

1199
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:49,839
with the packet so for example if i

1200
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:52,800
would have

1201
00:42:49,839 --> 00:42:54,400
uh five blacklisted routers yes i can

1202
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:58,400
use a bloom filter

1203
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:59,280
and i could zip my mac addresses into

1204
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:02,480
the packet that

1205
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:05,119
it will not it would not be very big but

1206
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:06,240
if i would have something more fancy

1207
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:09,440
like

1208
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:12,560
ignore these routers prefer these ones

1209
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:12,960
and not go through here and so on then

1210
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:17,040
you

1211
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:19,680
suddenly uh can send megabytes

1212
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:20,720
of additional data just because you

1213
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:24,560
forgot

1214
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:27,598
yeah so it's uh

1215
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:29,279
it's the second part this is not really

1216
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:31,839
true maybe we did not explain it

1217
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:33,599
fully but this whole configuration you

1218
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:35,520
do not attach it to the packet

1219
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:37,359
because this is not really source

1220
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:40,000
routing what you are doing

1221
00:43:37,359 --> 00:43:42,000
you just as a client you select the path

1222
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:44,880
so you do not send a packet

1223
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,760
saying to the next router on the way i

1224
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:47,440
want to avoid

1225
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:49,040
china that's not what happens the

1226
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:51,040
decision you want to avoid

1227
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:52,880
china happens at the moment when you

1228
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:55,599
send a packet from your machine

1229
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:58,400
which means no router on the way knows

1230
00:43:55,599 --> 00:44:00,960
that you have a policy avoid china

1231
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:01,920
the only thing they see is that you've

1232
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:04,640
made a choice of

1233
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:06,720
arbitrary routers on the way they do not

1234
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:07,200
know what incentive do you have behind

1235
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:10,399
this

1236
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:12,480
they so this is a very let me say

1237
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:13,520
stupid way of routing because you're a

1238
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:15,680
seller router

1239
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:16,960
what should be the next hop you are not

1240
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:18,960
telling router to make

1241
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:20,800
any kind of decision router is not

1242
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:22,000
decisive in this path because you've

1243
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:24,000
made a selection

1244
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,680
when you constructed your packet of

1245
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,359
course if something happens and the path

1246
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:27,839
is not available your packet will not

1247
00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:30,480
make it

1248
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:33,920
because router will not be will not be

1249
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:33,920
allowed to make the change

1250
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:39,599
uh as for the first part of the question

1251
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:42,319
which was like yeah okay but people will

1252
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:43,760
kind of do the default routes that they

1253
00:44:42,319 --> 00:44:46,000
are doing anyway and just

1254
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:47,119
think they have the choice um we think

1255
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,440
that

1256
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:51,599
it is an interesting question to design

1257
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:53,599
the paths in a way that makes

1258
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:55,520
better use of the internet than it is

1259
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:57,680
today so for example if you have

1260
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:59,200
if you give the users three paths and

1261
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:00,480
all of them go to the first path

1262
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:02,640
then that path will suddenly be

1263
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:04,560
congested and will have a higher latency

1264
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:05,680
so it is actually in the user's own

1265
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:08,480
self-interest

1266
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:08,960
to try to kind of load balance things

1267
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:11,040
right

1268
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:13,119
but then it is up to us the programmers

1269
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:14,160
to design good algorithms that are able

1270
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:16,240
to do this

1271
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:18,000
without introducing oscillations and

1272
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:20,399
stuff but it

1273
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:22,560
there can be options which are where it

1274
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:23,280
is useful for the user from the selfish

1275
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:26,960
perspective

1276
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:26,960
to do the right thing for the network

1277
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:33,440
yeah and the problem with this design is

1278
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:35,920
that

1279
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:37,040
i don't know which routers will be down

1280
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:47,599
in the future

1281
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:50,720
so that's that's what i cared thanks

1282
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:52,160
hi um i was just wondering let's say i'm

1283
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:54,240
i'm a business and i want to start using

1284
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:56,160
scion and i have an isp

1285
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:57,839
and they're prepared to start offering

1286
00:45:56,160 --> 00:46:00,160
scion in practice

1287
00:45:57,839 --> 00:46:01,839
at the moment could an isp just start

1288
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:04,399
offering it to their customers or

1289
00:46:01,839 --> 00:46:05,599
would they be waiting on a number of

1290
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:08,480
other organizations

1291
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:09,280
to all start offering it for the like to

1292
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:12,240
communicate

1293
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:14,000
to the other side of the world so this

1294
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:17,040
this really depends on the case

1295
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,680
so i not sure how much i can tell you

1296
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:19,680
without

1297
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:21,440
paying debt till end of my life and

1298
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:23,839
getting fired as soon as i

1299
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:25,040
leave the building but i believe we

1300
00:46:23,839 --> 00:46:27,680
already have

1301
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:30,000
at least one isp who prepared a

1302
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:32,560
commercial offer to a customer

1303
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,920
to run native scion so this answers

1304
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:37,040
partially the question

1305
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:38,960
however i believe if i as a private

1306
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:42,240
customer matters kowalski leaving

1307
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:42,720
xyz if i went to another isp and i told

1308
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:45,279
them

1309
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:46,480
hey guys can you give me native scion

1310
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:49,520
connection to my home

1311
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:52,400
they will tell me yeah you know sure but

1312
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:53,359
100 million swiss francs and maybe in 10

1313
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:57,200
years

1314
00:46:53,359 --> 00:46:58,480
so this is a very tricky question but

1315
00:46:57,200 --> 00:47:01,040
of course as with any business it

1316
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:03,680
depends on your size it depends

1317
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:04,240
who you are in the country what power do

1318
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:05,759
you have

1319
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:07,439
we are somehow in switzerland in this

1320
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:10,400
comfortable situation that we are

1321
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:12,240
doing a lot of government projects so if

1322
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:13,920
government decides that we are running

1323
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:17,040
this project for banks now

1324
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:18,800
banks have to comply so some businesses

1325
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:19,920
they do not have a choice they will just

1326
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:22,000
join the party

1327
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:23,599
because they are told to do so but i

1328
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,359
agree this is very comfortable situation

1329
00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:27,839
as a private customer probably it would

1330
00:47:25,359 --> 00:47:29,520
take you much more effort

1331
00:47:27,839 --> 00:47:32,558
i think maybe the question was also

1332
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:34,160
about okay i want to send scion traffic

1333
00:47:32,559 --> 00:47:36,480
from here to there

1334
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:37,680
but i it doesn't work if only that my

1335
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:40,160
isp

1336
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:41,200
says okay we'll do scion for you but it

1337
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:44,319
has to be every

1338
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:46,399
like the whole path must be scion

1339
00:47:44,319 --> 00:47:48,160
network right so that's it it's

1340
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:50,000
difficult to do it globally right now

1341
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:51,440
because there aren't asps in

1342
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,280
many countries in the world that offer

1343
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:55,359
this but that's again something that

1344
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:57,119
we are hoping to fix and also silent lab

1345
00:47:55,359 --> 00:47:57,520
research network is on four continents

1346
00:47:57,119 --> 00:47:59,359
so if

1347
00:47:57,520 --> 00:48:00,800
the research network is enough for you

1348
00:47:59,359 --> 00:48:03,520
then that's kind of an

1349
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:05,119
entity that already does this globally

1350
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:06,880
yeah so this is also kind of yeah

1351
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:08,720
let me get 30 seconds of this this is

1352
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:11,839
what makes it different from standard

1353
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:14,000
sd1 and and list lines and mpls because

1354
00:48:11,839 --> 00:48:15,040
you do not need to have a dedicated line

1355
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,359
between

1356
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:18,079
every branch of your business we are

1357
00:48:17,359 --> 00:48:20,480
building

1358
00:48:18,079 --> 00:48:21,359
a fabric so we can just join the network

1359
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:23,359
fabric

1360
00:48:21,359 --> 00:48:25,119
and we are building backbone for you

1361
00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:26,960
which means it's cheaper because we'll

1362
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:27,680
provide you backbone you just need to

1363
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:30,240
provide the

1364
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:31,839
end the end hope the last hope to to

1365
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:35,680
both your premises but you will be

1366
00:48:31,839 --> 00:48:37,759
consuming the backbone which is provided

1367
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:38,720
a question about how it looks on the

1368
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:42,800
wire

1369
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:45,919
so does it mean that every package

1370
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:49,440
every packet has embedded

1371
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:51,760
a preferred route uh where is

1372
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:52,480
this route placed is it like ip

1373
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:55,040
extension

1374
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:56,000
uh header or like some kind of

1375
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:58,960
encapsulation

1376
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:59,440
on top of ip or is it udp or what what

1377
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:02,480
is it

1378
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:03,599
yeah so uh we have had like people

1379
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:05,920
thought about this

1380
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:07,440
and figured out that the best way to

1381
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:08,000
actually have all of these features and

1382
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:09,119
not

1383
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:11,119
end up with something completely

1384
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:12,559
horrible is actually to design a

1385
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:15,280
completely new header

1386
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:16,000
so we have a custom header uh we kind of

1387
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:18,640
need this because

1388
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,280
of also the cryptographic checks that we

1389
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:23,680
do

1390
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:26,240
um so we put the we have our own header

1391
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:26,879
and we have a reference implementation

1392
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:28,640
and

1393
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:31,040
we have given some thought to whether

1394
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:33,839
this header is

1395
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:35,680
doable in in hardware and we have made

1396
00:49:33,839 --> 00:49:37,200
some changes to the format of the header

1397
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:38,799
so that it is possible to do it at high

1398
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:40,240
for performance and header

1399
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:41,920
in hardware but yeah it's a custom

1400
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:44,959
header okay

1401
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:48,640
uh last question now okay

1402
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:52,480
do you under multicast routing

1403
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:56,000
multicast do you enter

1404
00:49:52,480 --> 00:50:00,000
only unicast or also multicast routing

1405
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:01,920
oh multicast um we

1406
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,119
there has been some thought given to

1407
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:06,480
multicast but

1408
00:50:03,119 --> 00:50:09,359
i i think it's probably too early

1409
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:10,400
because we are still like fleshing out

1410
00:50:09,359 --> 00:50:12,960
the details of that

1411
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:13,680
so we don't have anything publishable

1412
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:15,920
right now

1413
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:17,118
but there is some research ongoing at

1414
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:18,880
our university

1415
00:50:17,119 --> 00:50:21,040
if i remember correctly there was one

1416
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:22,480
project working on multicast it never

1417
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:24,880
made it to the hope

1418
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:25,599
to the to the reference implementation

1419
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:27,920
but

1420
00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:29,040
it wasn't only technical choice as far

1421
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:31,280
as i remember there was

1422
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:32,160
a lot of discussions whether we really

1423
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:34,640
want to provide

1424
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:35,680
multicast like what is the real use case

1425
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:37,839
of multicast

1426
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:39,200
why people want to do it and if they

1427
00:50:37,839 --> 00:50:40,400
really want maybe they are doing

1428
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:41,680
something wrong

1429
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:43,599
because this is kind of a way of

1430
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:45,118
thinking we do not want to take the

1431
00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:47,040
existing protocols and

1432
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:48,640
implement exactly the same features

1433
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:49,440
because then it does bunch of guys

1434
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:51,598
redoing

1435
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:54,000
work you know reinventing the wheel we

1436
00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:56,720
want to go back to the beginning

1437
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:57,440
and ask what is really the future you

1438
00:50:56,720 --> 00:51:00,558
want

1439
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:02,400
and why do you want it only after this

1440
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:04,160
we will provide you a set of stuff

1441
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:05,680
that will fulfill your purposes but

1442
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:07,520
saying kind of things like i want

1443
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:10,558
multicast because i have multicast

1444
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:13,759
in ipv4 right now it's yeah

1445
00:51:10,559 --> 00:51:15,200
i do not think people really want to go

1446
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:16,800
like this and fight with this kind of

1447
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:19,279
arguments

1448
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:21,040
okay thank you matthias thank you

1449
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:22,720
camilla for your enthusiastic and

1450
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:34,640
interesting presentation

1451
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:34,640
thank audience for the interest
