1
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,759
okay

2
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:15,280
so hi my name is pedro

3
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:20,320
i'm a designer during my free time

4
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:24,880
i enjoy to travel to meet folks like you

5
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:28,240
but also regarding design arts

6
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:32,960
i also when i do have a little time

7
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:36,079
i conduct some kind of workshops

8
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,120
regarding ux design but as well graphic

9
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:40,320
design

10
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:42,640
at the beautiful city of prague czech

11
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:46,800
republic

12
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:50,399
i'm also a happy camper at collabora

13
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:52,959
and today i intend you to show i intend

14
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:56,559
to show you how easy it can be

15
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:59,760
to customize collabora online you know

16
00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:03,039
without tricks and without coding

17
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:06,158
and this type of thing so any designer

18
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:09,600
should be able to do it or even any

19
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:13,840
business owner right um

20
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:17,199
so talking about customization

21
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,080
there is great advantages regarding

22
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,880
customizations

23
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,320
not only because it allows you to

24
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:25,360
customize

25
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,880
customize it according to your needs or

26
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:30,720
even your personal taste

27
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,720
it can be just that and that's fine

28
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:35,840
so for that we will be probably working

29
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:40,799
with

30
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:44,399
xml css and svg um

31
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:48,000
nothing too complex um

32
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:50,960
so uh we can divide um

33
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,600
we can divide the the theme in two

34
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:56,719
pieces if you will

35
00:01:53,600 --> 00:02:00,240
the widgets um that

36
00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:02,399
you know includes um dialogue sidebar

37
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:05,199
etc and all the controls

38
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,240
and the overall theme so basically the

39
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:11,360
rest right

40
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:14,720
tollbars icons drop down menus

41
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:17,760
um going through uh widgets

42
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:20,480
so uh widgets are customizable

43
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,840
that's why i'm talking and starting with

44
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:24,160
them

45
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,200
they actually use this new extended

46
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:28,560
instance

47
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,679
of native widget framework and i really

48
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,720
recommend you

49
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:35,200
um to either after um

50
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:37,120
or when you have time to watch the the

51
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:39,040
talk from tomasz where he talks a little

52
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:42,560
bit about these intricacies

53
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:46,079
um of how this was implemented

54
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:48,840
uh but for now um let's just say that um

55
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,000
it draws the interface depending on the

56
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:53,040
definition

57
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,000
or to be honest a set of definitions um

58
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:57,040
that are um included in one file and

59
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,159
we'll see that

60
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:02,239
uh later on um it allows

61
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:05,120
multiple customizations right so

62
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:08,640
multiple definitions

63
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:12,400
which in turn means multiple themes

64
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:15,440
um this is really cool

65
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:18,879
we can now have a theme depending on

66
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:22,079
an environment um and big

67
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:24,879
thanks for athenis for this yes

68
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,239
um now it's really cool that you know we

69
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:29,200
open calebra in

70
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:29,920
on an ipad and without doing nothing it

71
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:33,440
just

72
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:35,599
knows that it's an ios device

73
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:37,120
and it just serves you with the right

74
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:39,518
thing

75
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,319
with the ios like components and we'll

76
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,720
see this

77
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:44,399
later on sorry for the bullets i also

78
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,560
don't like it that much

79
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:49,360
but we will see more pictures um

80
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:53,040
[Music]

81
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:56,400
let's let him take a peach

82
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:58,159
perfect um you know and this in return

83
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:01,360
gives you the opportunity to forces

84
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:05,840
going from for instance the

85
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:10,159
no yes going from a purplish

86
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:14,000
theme um where you see

87
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:17,680
not only colors but even components are

88
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:20,478
from this theme to something

89
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,840
uh versus more bright where the accent

90
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:24,400
color is actually blue

91
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:26,840
and even the the controls per se

92
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:29,120
completely change you see

93
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:32,320
here

94
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,040
this is great and especially when you

95
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:36,719
can

96
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:39,440
serve it uh depending on the theme as we

97
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:42,240
discussed earlier so you see the the the

98
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:45,199
components change completely

99
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,600
now i'm going to show you an example of

100
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:48,880
how

101
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:52,720
you do that right step by step

102
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:55,360
so imagine you want to tweak

103
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:58,000
a particular dialogue a particular

104
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:00,160
component of a dialog

105
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,320
it could be it couldn't be easier right

106
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:06,800
so you go to your instd

107
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:09,440
directory inside of your core

108
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,400
and here you will find in this subfolder

109
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:13,840
online

110
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:15,198
this xml file yeah it couldn't be more

111
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,719
semantic right

112
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:18,240
a file it as definition is called

113
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,800
definition

114
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,680
and inside you will see a bunch of sub

115
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:25,360
tags

116
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:29,120
now let's discuss one by one the style

117
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:32,639
tag in a simple way

118
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:35,840
it deals with colors right highlight

119
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:38,800
font colors so even without

120
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,440
messing too much around too many svgs

121
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:43,919
etc

122
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:52,800
you can just tweak the overall aesthetic

123
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:56,080
just by changing those values

124
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:59,919
next we have settings

125
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:02,960
at set and settings you can set um

126
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:06,479
values of things that are not particular

127
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,880
particularly from a specific control per

128
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:10,080
se

129
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:13,120
but um generally for instance

130
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:14,318
margins uh tabs alignment right and we

131
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:17,360
know that there is

132
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:18,319
some dialogues with all with quite the

133
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,440
number of tabs

134
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:26,240
so you can control that

135
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:30,319
the default font size etc

136
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:34,720
and now we reach to our first

137
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:37,759
control let's simplify this

138
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:39,840
so we can divide this in three parts

139
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:42,000
so first we need to say which type of

140
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:45,280
control we are talking about right

141
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:48,479
here let's let's talk about our little

142
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:51,840
radio button then

143
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:56,080
you will say okay this control

144
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:58,479
will have this size using the part tag

145
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:01,120
and inside of this part tag you will

146
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:04,240
have a bunch of states

147
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:06,639
now each of this state

148
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,400
is actually not an individual state but

149
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:11,520
a combination of states

150
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:12,318
right so as you see here um i'm saying

151
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:16,240
hey

152
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:20,080
um please define that

153
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:24,160
when the when the radio button is

154
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:28,479
enabled not pressed and checked

155
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:30,240
use this svg right and you see that

156
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:32,639
all the other states are actually a

157
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:35,919
combination of states

158
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:38,720
you see uh these allows you to have

159
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:39,919
many intermediary states right not just

160
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:43,199
the on off

161
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:44,318
disable enable um which is really

162
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:48,160
awesome

163
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:50,960
because if you play your svgs right

164
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:53,440
um you can achieve uh some inter

165
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:57,039
interesting uh aesthetic results so

166
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:58,800
uh for instance here when it goes uh

167
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:02,080
basically you are talking about when the

168
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:06,240
radio uh button is on and it's pressed

169
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:08,960
and we kinda i'm not sure if you see it

170
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,319
with the video project but we are

171
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:13,359
already dimming out

172
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:14,400
uh our little inner circle so it almost

173
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,919
gives this

174
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:18,000
even though there is an animation it

175
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:18,400
gives the essence and gives this visual

176
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,039
cue

177
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:26,799
to the user and that's cool

178
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:29,280
um now yeah we here we have uh yes

179
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:31,039
it shouldn't be like this yeah sorry for

180
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:33,020
the rending issue

181
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:34,240
uh maybe the resolution um

182
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:36,478
[Music]

183
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,360
and exactly we have many states as we

184
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:40,640
say like

185
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,440
of course uh more than one state can be

186
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:44,240
catch

187
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,800
right more than one state can be active

188
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,880
um

189
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:48,560
but just the first one will be

190
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:51,360
understood and rendered

191
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,160
um yeah that's why it's important for

192
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:55,600
this order

193
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:57,360
the order you you you set your um

194
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,279
states but of course you can always play

195
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,600
with it right you can

196
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:04,080
you set some definitions you play you

197
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:07,440
you you change some svgs

198
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:10,720
it's quite easy the svgs used

199
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:13,839
it would be located in parallel with

200
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:16,160
your xml file so

201
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:19,120
there is actually no structure folder

202
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,120
complexity here

203
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:26,160
now that being said it doesn't

204
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:27,439
it doesn't make much sense to customize

205
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,680
your widgets

206
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,880
and then forget the rest right

207
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:34,959
everything should be

208
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:37,360
uh one identity one visual identity

209
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:38,319
and i'm happy to say that it's should be

210
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,959
still

211
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,680
you know easy easy to set up and easy to

212
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:44,800
act

213
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:47,599
um even if you are just play with it

214
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,719
so in here uh inside of your online

215
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:52,640
directory

216
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:56,480
uh inside of this sub folder

217
00:09:52,640 --> 00:10:00,720
you will find many css many javascript

218
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:03,920
files so my word of advice

219
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:06,480
would be to don't try to uh

220
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:08,000
change or hack every single file because

221
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,959
then you will have many

222
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,440
loose pieces right and harder for you

223
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:13,119
even

224
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,480
even if it's just personally even if

225
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,160
you're just playing with it it'll be

226
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,800
harder for you to maintain

227
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:20,480
and then you fix some css rule in one

228
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,439
file and then you find out that in the

229
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,160
other file is

230
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:25,240
yeah so and that's why you can just use

231
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:28,719
this file

232
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:30,959
branding.css and

233
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,959
of course if any uh images are

234
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:35,599
referenced there or you want to add

235
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:36,239
any extra image you can just drop them

236
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,440
here

237
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:42,399
right um

238
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,680
before the all these you need to get

239
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:46,800
collaborate

240
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:49,120
or development version of it right

241
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,000
and be sure this is quite important that

242
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,440
the code

243
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:56,480
brand package it's on your machine right

244
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:59,680
just to check um and then

245
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:03,040
hopefully you will see what we see here

246
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:04,880
right now uh

247
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,160
these are this has a couple of

248
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:08,800
advantages right

249
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:10,319
uh you have just one place where your

250
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:15,040
all these customizations go

251
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:17,360
one file one folder that's it

252
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:19,839
but what if and we sometimes receive

253
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:21,839
some these emails where if you

254
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:23,600
uh went really happy with our

255
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:24,800
customizations and suddenly you want to

256
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:28,320
have many

257
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:31,279
variants of your own customizations

258
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:33,279
suddenly you want to have your own

259
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:36,480
personal set of customizations

260
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:38,480
your little themes if you will

261
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,839
it will be a little bit troublesome to

262
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:42,720
just uh

263
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:43,519
you know have it like branding

264
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,360
underscore

265
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:47,760
copy one and then you know and then if

266
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:50,880
you want to change you need to rename

267
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:54,720
um so uh

268
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:58,079
for it um you should just

269
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:59,040
we have here a potato and for for for

270
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:02,560
this case

271
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:04,639
you should either you know

272
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:06,800
refrain to have these multiple files and

273
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:09,360
just have this css file

274
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,399
and everything is there so for instance

275
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:13,120
if you want to

276
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:14,720
um if you want to change the the

277
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,959
currency symbol

278
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,000
imagine uh you have a specific

279
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:21,199
requirement

280
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,360
from your customers or even at your home

281
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:25,519
someone really likes potatoes right and

282
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:28,079
for them potatoes means currency

283
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:29,760
and that's how they see it so you should

284
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:32,719
be as easy

285
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:34,480
as a potato to just replace the svg with

286
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:37,519
your svg

287
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,720
and making sure that this is over this

288
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:42,240
folder

289
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:44,560
and then it should be um you know

290
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,639
easy peasy right it will just redraw and

291
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:49,760
you will have a potato as your format

292
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:51,200
a currency symbol um

293
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:53,600
[Music]

294
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:55,200
so at the end this gives you a great

295
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,600
flexibility because it's really up to

296
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,079
you

297
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,120
uh like it doesn't matter your method it

298
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:01,359
doesn't matter how

299
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,959
how you do it locally at the end you

300
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,839
just need to be sure that you update

301
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:06,880
that css

302
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:10,000
you drop it there right that

303
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:13,360
images are located here and that's it

304
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:15,680
right now could you improve this

305
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:19,120
workflow

306
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:19,120
and again i reiterate

307
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:24,160
you are free you know to choose whatever

308
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:27,680
method you want

309
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:31,040
what you what you might start to

310
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:32,800
think is that okay wait what if i divide

311
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:35,760
the css file in

312
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:39,519
multiple css files that have my own

313
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:42,959
customizations and i can play with it

314
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:45,519
like i used again recommend

315
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:46,959
don't do that because then it means that

316
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:49,519
you will alter your

317
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:51,760
lowly flat directory so it will not be

318
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:54,000
this pristine directory anymore suddenly

319
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:55,839
you'll have many things happening there

320
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,120
so for instance if there is an update or

321
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:58,399
something you will have again these

322
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,880
loose pieces

323
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:03,519
um and then you might think okay but i

324
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:05,760
will maybe i can change the classes

325
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:08,160
in the html no don't do that it will be

326
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:11,279
really messy

327
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:13,839
so maybe if you really want

328
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:14,399
to have a more organized structure of

329
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:17,440
your own

330
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:18,880
locally i mean apart from collaboration

331
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:21,600
so you have your own things

332
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:22,320
and then uh wherever you want you just

333
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,440
want to

334
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:27,040
okay now i want to have it from my own

335
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,639
customizations and i want to drop it to

336
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:30,240
collaborate and everything works if you

337
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:33,360
want that

338
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:36,079
maybe uh we can talk about

339
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:38,320
repo preprocessor right and this css

340
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:42,800
preprocessor

341
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:45,680
it allows you um to compile i think yes

342
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,880
it allows you to compile from a script

343
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:50,000
scripting language

344
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:54,240
to css um

345
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:57,600
and this yes adds a layer of complexity

346
00:14:54,240 --> 00:15:01,680
but it also and we will

347
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:03,199
for this example we'll take says um

348
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:05,279
and there is there is many as you see

349
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:07,599
but will for this example will takes us

350
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:08,959
these are these suddenly allows you to

351
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:13,040
work with variables

352
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:15,599
functions uh what they call mixings um

353
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:16,639
this translated means that you can avoid

354
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,480
repetition

355
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:20,079
because you can have variables and you

356
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,839
can have for instance even the in this

357
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:23,760
example where we are talking about

358
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:25,920
vendor-specific proprieties for instance

359
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,880
when you want to transform an element in

360
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:29,680
css

361
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:30,480
or other example and you need to use

362
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,880
more uh

363
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:34,720
these vendors specific either for for

364
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:36,639
that browser or that browser

365
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,839
you can add these in one place and reuse

366
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:39,920
the code right so you don't

367
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:42,000
need to have this redundancy all over

368
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:45,680
the place

369
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,800
um yes plus it will still allow you to

370
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:49,040
debug directly

371
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:50,399
directly on a browser as you have been

372
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:52,800
doing with css

373
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:54,800
you just need to be sure that you have

374
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:58,880
the source maps on

375
00:15:54,800 --> 00:16:02,240
um and source maps are nothing more than

376
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:05,920
little files that tell the browser hey

377
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:08,560
this css came from this uh uh

378
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:09,680
scripting file that happens to be a sas

379
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:12,319
file

380
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:13,680
and this even allows you to edit the the

381
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:16,000
sas file directly

382
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:17,040
and you can then use these links to just

383
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
to be sure

384
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:21,279
if they are enabled or set up correctly

385
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,480
in your preferred

386
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:27,279
browser um

387
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,680
how you'd go about to install it there

388
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:30,000
is

389
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:31,040
many ways and using many different

390
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,240
technologies

391
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:37,839
so it's again great level of flexibility

392
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:38,880
it's really up to you and even all these

393
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:41,120
we are discussing

394
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:42,800
now it's even not needed it's if you are

395
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:46,079
happy with just css

396
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:48,240
just you know do your own customizations

397
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:49,519
just drop it in that directory we spoke

398
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:52,560
about it

399
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:55,759
and that's it you know no more work

400
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:56,638
um but if if you want more com more more

401
00:16:55,759 --> 00:17:00,079
level of

402
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:03,279
granular um level of organization

403
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:06,720
you might want to install it over

404
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:09,199
your preferred implementation

405
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:12,640
again a word of advice this is the

406
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:16,240
primary implementation which means that

407
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:19,600
performance fixes and even new features

408
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:21,280
always appear first on dart

409
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:23,198
and then it's up to the communities on

410
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:25,599
the other implementations if they appear

411
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:29,360
or not or even with some

412
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:32,159
small tweaks different tweaks um

413
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:33,760
now this is how you could structure it

414
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:37,360
uh you know locally

415
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:39,360
right so again the big advantage is that

416
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:41,199
it doesn't affect your lowly flat

417
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:44,719
directory so your online

418
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:47,520
uh folder structure is still pristine

419
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,559
you know no no no probability of

420
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:51,200
problems there

421
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:52,559
um and here is how you could uh uh

422
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,799
structure right so

423
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:56,000
you could for instance uh divide it in

424
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:58,799
in components

425
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,760
your own of course here i went crazy i

426
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:01,600
i'm just to

427
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:03,039
give an example that you can really go

428
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:05,918
granular and you can really

429
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:07,440
have a lot of customizations as much as

430
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:09,440
you want

431
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,640
and then you'll have for instance a base

432
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:14,320
file

433
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:18,000
where all your theme specific variables

434
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:21,360
will be right and then this little guy

435
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:23,919
actually our main guy would uh

436
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:25,600
do the breach of all these files and say

437
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:27,200
if there is a rule that comes from one

438
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:30,399
of this file

439
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:31,600
and uses a specific theme you guys say

440
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,760
okay give me this

441
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:35,600
this this this color from this specific

442
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:38,799
theme and we'll probably

443
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:42,559
read from this variables file and we'll

444
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:45,280
see this in a minute so

445
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:45,840
so you don't need to worry and finally

446
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:50,000
to run

447
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:52,879
would be for instance just one line um

448
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,520
and there is quite interesting uh flags

449
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,360
here

450
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:57,120
but the the advantage here is that you

451
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:59,199
can automate this process right you can

452
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,918
run this in on a terminal and actually

453
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:03,120
many

454
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:05,360
um editors even have

455
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,320
some plugins that if you really don't

456
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,639
want to even

457
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:10,000
can avoid the terminal and run this on

458
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:12,559
the background

459
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,200
and it will be watching al always your

460
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:16,799
file

461
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:20,480
and you see even even your own customer

462
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:23,600
custom uh structure is in your

463
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:25,760
local folder it can automatically deploy

464
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:27,360
to the directory we spoke about it

465
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:30,879
so tien is doing the same right it's

466
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:32,639
just uh rewriting that file

467
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:35,120
and then there is cool things like you

468
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:39,200
can choose a compressed style for

469
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:42,399
you know a smaller file etc

470
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:45,200
but enough of bullets

471
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,919
let's see an example or second example

472
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:50,000
actually

473
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:52,080
so you see here and i try to be a little

474
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,000
bit brief and talk just a small detail

475
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,120
because i think then it's clear to

476
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,840
follow through

477
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:58,239
so you see we have here we are talking

478
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:01,039
about

479
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:03,919
about drop down menus uh different

480
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:06,799
accent colors for instance even here

481
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:07,280
we have a normal font height certainly

482
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:11,600
here

483
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:13,120
we have bold how you'd go about

484
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:16,158
if we want to reference this different

485
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:19,600
set of customizations

486
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:23,039
easy so following that structure

487
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:25,280
we'll just go to our toolbar up file

488
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:26,400
with set normally as we do for instance

489
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:29,520
in css

490
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:32,320
but instead of keep keeping uh

491
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:33,120
hemi hammering down all the rules here

492
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:35,360
and probably

493
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:36,799
if we want if we have like two three set

494
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:39,120
of customization

495
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:40,080
we will have these times two times three

496
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,639
who knows

497
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:43,840
so instead of these we say okay no no

498
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:46,400
just go

499
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:47,760
and dr and and ask this little fellow

500
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:51,039
our base

501
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:54,158
file where we have all these theme

502
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:57,520
specific variables etc and

503
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:57,520
get the values from there

504
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:02,720
on that side this could be an

505
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:04,639
implementation where we have just the

506
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:07,440
two set of of of rules

507
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:08,799
and said okay so if this variable is set

508
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,600
to this use this if

509
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:14,080
it's set to our your theme two which is

510
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:17,120
extremely semantic variable

511
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:17,520
value you'd use this and certainly have

512
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,918
these

513
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:21,760
two different set of customizations and

514
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:22,799
this is just one way to go about it of

515
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:25,520
course if you

516
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:27,600
if you read the previous uh slide there

517
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:29,840
is

518
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:31,280
there is many methods you can go about

519
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:35,600
it right you can even have

520
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:38,399
a theme many themes for each specific

521
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:39,760
file right it's up to you again a

522
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:43,360
greater level of

523
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:45,200
flexibility but just to make it simple

524
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:47,760
i use like this i think it's easy to

525
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:50,000
follow um

526
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:51,440
you know and at the end the goal here is

527
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,640
to make it yours

528
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:57,280
right either for your own personal taste

529
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:58,000
or if you have a specific need for as we

530
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:00,158
saw

531
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,360
previously if you want to have a

532
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:03,280
currency uh

533
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:05,280
format icon that is not a coin but it's

534
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,678
a potato no problem you can just switch

535
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,360
it

536
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:08,960
and have it there so it's really up to

537
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:11,199
you and this is just

538
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,880
a couple of examples how you know the

539
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:15,360
variety you can get from these simple

540
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,360
steps

541
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:27,840
yes thank you i hope it was not too fast

542
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:27,840
and not too slow

543
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,440
yes sir and sorry for i know you were

544
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:35,360
waiting here

545
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:40,559
long time but i was waiting for everyone

546
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:44,479
to calm down before starting

547
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:44,480
tell me tom i'm trying to figure out

548
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:49,600
the separation between the rendering on

549
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:53,120
the server side

550
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:55,199
which is done in java i believe and

551
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:56,479
the rendering on the client side because

552
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:59,600
where is the rendering done

553
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:00,880
with the css files is that done on the

554
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:03,600
server as well then

555
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:09,840
wait uh it depends because i go back a

556
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:09,840
little bit

557
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:16,639
okay or

558
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:23,520
yes like if we are talking about widgets

559
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:26,880
it's different

560
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:30,720
right uh because as you notice

561
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:32,720
we are actually not using uh css inside

562
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:36,480
when we are defining these

563
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:39,200
objects right so

564
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:40,720
uh and i hope we have time uh i skipped

565
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,559
that because i i thought we wouldn't

566
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:45,679
have time for that but for instance

567
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:48,320
um uh these there is many of these

568
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:49,840
components they are svgs

569
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:52,080
right so for instance when we go here to

570
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:54,480
our definitions

571
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:56,080
you see there are svgs right now we have

572
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:59,279
two types of svgs

573
00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:00,720
on one side we have the svgs regarding

574
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:03,039
the controls

575
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:04,559
right and they are they end up to be

576
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:08,320
rendered as a bitmap

577
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:10,879
then we have other svgs the svgs that um

578
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:12,639
they are mutable they are changing right

579
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:15,679
for instance an svg

580
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:18,880
for instance for our

581
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:23,200
um i don't know drop down menu or

582
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:26,400
you know they change um with

583
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:29,919
so they're actually render rendered

584
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:30,799
via draw comments right so there is a

585
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:34,080
difference there

586
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:35,200
but if you are talking about like if you

587
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:37,600
are talking about

588
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:39,520
the overall thing so not the widgets per

589
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:42,639
se but overall theme

590
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:44,639
uh then uh the

591
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:46,080
the coolness of these is that you can

592
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:49,919
have it you can have online

593
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:53,879
running you can you can even use the

594
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:55,360
web tools on a browser uh go to that

595
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:57,520
branding.css

596
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:59,120
change it or even arnold delete the

597
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:00,799
whole thing and paste

598
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:03,520
whatever you want and you will see in

599
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:05,918
real time uh the changes appearing

600
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:07,279
yeah so it depending on what you are

601
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:10,240
talking about

602
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:11,520
it's slightly on this particular screen

603
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:14,400
that you can see here

604
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:15,840
like what is rendered on the server what

605
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,559
is on the right side is rendered from

606
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:18,720
the browser

607
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:19,840
yeah what parts of the right side are

608
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:22,080
rendered

609
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:25,449
everything is not wide

610
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:25,449
[Laughter]

611
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:29,840
everything that is

612
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,039
the thing that you can you can do in the

613
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:35,840
css

614
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:36,960
so all the icons you can do in css all

615
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:40,000
the

616
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:43,200
all the menus you can do in css all the

617
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,520
status bar you can do it in css okay so

618
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:47,360
but

619
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:49,360
the big one thing uh that's the document

620
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:51,918
so like normally there will be some text

621
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:53,600
and stuff that is not

622
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:55,279
that is rendered on the server so you're

623
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:57,360
gonna find it so

624
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:58,400
that's where the separation was yes okay

625
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:00,719
yes but

626
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,679
then you can see these dialogues there

627
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:11,520
and these are

628
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:15,200
the servers

629
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:15,200
it's awesome to have candy in the room

630
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:22,720
as well what the presentation so

631
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:24,960
i'm not sure anymore how liberals is

632
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,960
calling

633
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:41,440
the slides it's the same way so again

634
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:44,480
the document

635
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:48,240
but once you start the presentation

636
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:53,840
it's you next it's you next

637
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:53,840
i don't know sorry

638
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:14,158
oh it's okay i don't need applause no no
