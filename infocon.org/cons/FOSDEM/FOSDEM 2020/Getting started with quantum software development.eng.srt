1
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:08,559
good morning everyone

2
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:13,678
welcome to the quantum dev room happy to

3
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,480
see that many people

4
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:19,039
found a room i want to introduce the

5
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:21,199
first speaker of the day which is tomasz

6
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:23,199
thomas holds two master degrees one in

7
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:24,480
theoretical computer science and one in

8
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:26,480
cyber security

9
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,480
and he's one of the co-founders of the

10
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:31,519
quantum open source foundation

11
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,719
and the biotech startup protein cure

12
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:35,199
and he has worked with most of the

13
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:36,719
different quantum hardware architectures

14
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,320
and deeply believes in the value of

15
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,879
combining quantum computing

16
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:45,840
and open source so please welcome the

17
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:45,839
speaker with me

18
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,199
all right guys can you can you hear me

19
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,120
okay it seems like uh

20
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:56,480
the volume is okay maybe a little bit

21
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:59,440
too loud

22
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,839
um all right first of all welcome to the

23
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:03,280
room

24
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:06,479
we ended up having a little bit

25
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,920
um of an emergency reshuffling our

26
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:11,039
original room

27
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:14,240
got flooded by here so that's why we're

28
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:17,600
in this bigger space

29
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:20,320
so this is this room is organized by

30
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:22,720
the quantum open source foundation and

31
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:25,679
we are happy to be at fosdem again

32
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,080
um last year was our first year being

33
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,600
here

34
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:32,079
and we really enjoyed it so

35
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:34,720
we're really happy to be here again this

36
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:37,919
time in uh in a bigger space

37
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:41,600
um we're gonna have 14 speakers today

38
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:44,399
um and we're trying to change the

39
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,520
actual kind of theme of the of the room

40
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:47,520
a little bit this year

41
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,439
last year we had a lot of speakers from

42
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,280
the quattrocoptic industry and

43
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:53,439
we're talking about many different uh

44
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:56,560
quantum computing libraries

45
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:58,479
this year we want to be more dynamic so

46
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:01,360
we're going to have shorter talks

47
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:02,000
the length of talks ranges from 35

48
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:05,360
minutes to

49
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,799
25 minutes and we'll also be more

50
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,639
project focused so we're going to be

51
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:10,080
speaking more about the

52
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:11,760
projects in the quantum public space

53
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,560
that some

54
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:16,560
you know academic groups or individuals

55
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:20,000
work on their

56
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:22,640
free time on or as part of their job

57
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,400
and last year we had a little bit of a

58
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:26,319
problem we had capacity of

59
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,520
roughly 90 people left i think in in the

60
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:31,119
room and

61
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:33,120
uh durham got really really packed uh we

62
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,239
actually nobody could even like leave

63
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,239
the room and

64
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:37,440
have any hope of getting back uh

65
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,879
throughout the day

66
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,200
this year it seems like the situation is

67
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:41,679
going to be a little bit little bit

68
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,720
better

69
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:46,160
um but since we since we moved and since

70
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,160
many people are still probably coming in

71
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:51,200
because they just just noticed that

72
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:53,280
the room has changed locations uh

73
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,720
if you see that people are coming in and

74
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,200
they're kind of like waiting on the

75
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,800
sidelines and you have seats on on the

76
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,319
sides and there's still space in them

77
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,159
in the middle you know feel free to kind

78
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:05,359
of compress and go into the

79
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:08,239
middle rows such that people have

80
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,239
no space to sit

81
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:13,440
okay and now coming

82
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:16,159
down to actually what i wanted to speak

83
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:19,280
about which is

84
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:20,319
introduction to quantum software

85
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,560
development

86
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:23,518
so i'm gonna gonna divide my talk into

87
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,599
three parts

88
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:27,519
in the first part i'm gonna talk about

89
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:30,959
some parallels that we can find

90
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:33,280
in quantum computing space right now um

91
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:34,799
with the development of machine learning

92
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,480
and how the field of machine learning

93
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:38,480
has developed

94
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,679
in a second part um i'm going to give

95
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,840
you guys a little

96
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,519
primer to quantum computing just a very

97
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,319
quick rundown of different architectures

98
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:46,560
and

99
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:48,238
things you need to know about quantum

100
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,760
computing to understand

101
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:53,280
um the rest of the day and in the last

102
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:56,000
part

103
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,280
okay uh in the last part we're going to

104
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,519
speak about a little bit

105
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,720
how you guys can help and how you know

106
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:03,519
software engineers and

107
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,239
computer scientists fit into the picture

108
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:07,760
and

109
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:10,640
you know how you can you know

110
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:11,679
lead i guess hand out your hand and

111
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:15,839
offer some help to do

112
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,840
these projects

113
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:19,599
so success of machine learning really

114
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,639
falls down

115
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:24,320
not only to machine learning scientists

116
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:27,840
but also a lot of work that has been

117
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:28,880
done around machine learning to kind of

118
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:32,000
help

119
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:32,800
foster the ease of adoption of of the

120
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,199
tools and

121
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,680
uh developments that are that are being

122
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:39,440
produced uh one of the big things that

123
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,120
helped people develop their own machine

124
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,639
learning solutions are machine learning

125
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,800
frameworks

126
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:45,759
and here on this slide i list a couple

127
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,000
of most

128
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:49,919
popular ones i'm pretty sure that you're

129
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,400
familiar with socket learn or

130
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:53,680
tensorflow or at least heard about these

131
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,919
libraries and

132
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,960
really what these projects do well is

133
00:04:55,919 --> 00:05:01,120
that they

134
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:04,880
have really nice well-documented apis

135
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:08,320
tutorials they have a really good

136
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:09,600
basically foundation that they offer to

137
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:12,159
anybody who wants to

138
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,360
jump in into the field so if you want to

139
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,080
start machine learning you don't

140
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,440
need to you know implement your own

141
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,080
machine learning algorithms from from

142
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,440
scratch

143
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,758
in c plus you can rely on all these

144
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:24,800
libraries and existing frameworks to

145
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:26,720
help you build your models and

146
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:30,080
that's something that really helps

147
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:32,240
people to jump into the field

148
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:34,960
then there's a lot of tooling that has

149
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:37,919
been developed that

150
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:39,599
helps people to not only develop their

151
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:40,639
models for example in the case of

152
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,039
jupiter notebooks

153
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:44,240
it's a really great collaboration tool

154
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:47,120
but also to

155
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,440
you know share their models and deploy

156
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,479
them

157
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:53,919
into production so for example the aux

158
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:54,880
framework over here is a tool that helps

159
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:58,080
you

160
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:59,199
you know share your model and provide an

161
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,800
inference pipeline

162
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,960
no matter what kind of framework you use

163
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:07,520
to actually train

164
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:10,400
the model itself so you can see that

165
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:12,000
once again the theme repeats um you not

166
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:15,198
only need the

167
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:18,400
underlying algorithms but you also

168
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:21,120
need to build a lot of tooling to bring

169
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:23,520
this technology machine learning into

170
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,520
the market

171
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:29,199
and last but not least a lot of progress

172
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:32,479
in machine learning has been really

173
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:33,520
fueled by just going for bigger and

174
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:35,919
bigger architectures

175
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,799
there's this joke in the community that

176
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:39,680
the bigger

177
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,479
is is better and the bigger network

178
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,520
solves everything

179
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:44,400
and on this graph on the on the left you

180
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,880
can you can see

181
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,799
that's a logarithmic plot you can see

182
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:51,199
how the different architectures that uh

183
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,880
you know became really successful how

184
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:56,000
much training they

185
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:57,120
um actually need um per day and you can

186
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,800
see that for off ago

187
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:05,840
zero reaching like a thousand

188
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:05,840
petaflops seconds per per day so

189
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:10,240
once again basically this development is

190
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:13,360
largely fueled

191
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,400
by engineers working on large scale

192
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,000
systems

193
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:18,080
on the on the right you can see the

194
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,960
pictures of the google tpu tensor

195
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,440
processor

196
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,799
processing unit um which kind of brings

197
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,520
in the hardware engineers into the

198
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,880
picture

199
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:29,359
so you can really see that it is a

200
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,319
effort of a whole range of diverse

201
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,479
backgrounds that is

202
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:35,680
kind of being combined here to produce

203
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:35,680
the successes that we see today

204
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:40,638
all right so now let's kind of

205
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:43,599
you know just keep that in the back of

206
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:48,160
our minds and let's jump into the

207
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:48,159
part of the quantum computing primer

208
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,240
um so i guess you guys are here because

209
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,360
you have been

210
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,720
hearing a lot about quantum computing

211
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,039
and

212
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,919
yeah there's like all these very um

213
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:01,840
hyped up

214
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:03,280
articles um you know if you scroll

215
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:06,318
through your linkedin feeds

216
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:08,318
um you're gonna see very various um

217
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,919
sensational things being written about

218
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:11,440
concocting so

219
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:13,758
yeah the question is how is it going to

220
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:16,160
actually change our lives

221
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:17,520
and even more recently a couple of

222
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,720
months ago quantum has

223
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:21,359
sorry google has announced that they

224
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:24,400
have reached this thing called quantum

225
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,680
supremacy and uh yeah what does that

226
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,919
even mean

227
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,879
for us are we going to throw away our

228
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:30,000
regular computers and

229
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:32,399
everybody's going to just have a quantum

230
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:36,000
computer now

231
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:38,159
it's it's unclear so the hype

232
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,279
is really really getting higher and

233
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:41,519
higher

234
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:42,719
this is the article that actually

235
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:45,600
announced the

236
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:46,800
quantum supremacy and you can see that

237
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,760
they used a

238
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:51,279
qpu with 53 qubits that can occupy a

239
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:54,880
state space of

240
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:58,160
two to the 53 because every qubit can

241
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:59,839
occupy two basis states

242
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:02,719
and you can see that if you were to

243
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:04,640
simulate this uh this

244
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,920
problem it would take you according to

245
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:08,240
this estimate

246
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:10,000
10 000 years on a state-of-the-art

247
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:13,200
supercomputer

248
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:16,399
so this this particular transition

249
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:18,000
having demonstrated that we

250
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:19,440
have solved the problem which is not

251
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
necessarily of

252
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,640
practical value right now this will be

253
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
called

254
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,680
but it's it's basically solved on a

255
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,600
quantum computer whereas we can't

256
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,120
efficiently do it on a classical

257
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:32,160
computer that's what we call

258
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,120
um quantum supremacy so it doesn't

259
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:36,000
actually

260
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,800
yet mean um that you know quantum

261
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,720
computer has

262
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,240
surpassed classical computers on a

263
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,880
practical problem um

264
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,519
and that terminology is uh something

265
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,640
that uh

266
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:46,320
you know is being fleshed out in the

267
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,040
field actually will zang here in the

268
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,760
audience is a

269
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,800
nice blog post about uh um you know

270
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,720
different

271
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,640
terms we should use for achieving

272
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,240
advantage and the quantum computing

273
00:09:54,640 --> 00:10:00,160
world with quantum computing

274
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:03,760
architectures so yeah

275
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:05,600
right now we are probably i would say

276
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,360
somewhere around the peak i don't know

277
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,800
how many people in the audience who are

278
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:12,480
familiar with the field to

279
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:14,719
agree with me and we're going to see how

280
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,320
the hype cycle evolves and what it's

281
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:19,600
going to do

282
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:21,040
to the field but the impact of quantum

283
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:24,320
computing

284
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:25,519
um really shouldn't be that you know we

285
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,160
shouldn't be thinking that it's going to

286
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:30,560
come here and it's going to like

287
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:32,800
replace all the methods that we already

288
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:34,880
have to solve solve problems

289
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,920
um rather what we should think about we

290
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,760
should think about

291
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,959
quantum computing helping us solve more

292
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,120
problems

293
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:42,399
so what are the things that quantum

294
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:45,680
computers would be

295
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:47,040
good at well these are problems like

296
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:49,519
optimization problems

297
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,880
you know classic example is this

298
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:52,959
traveling salesman

299
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,399
problem where you try to find a path

300
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:56,079
through a city

301
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:59,360
that is most efficient and visits all

302
00:10:56,079 --> 00:11:01,120
the nodes that you specified for example

303
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,640
um you know encryption and cyber

304
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:05,360
security we can

305
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:06,640
hear a lot about quantum computers being

306
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,000
thread to our

307
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,839
cyber security systems because they're

308
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,760
going to break our

309
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:13,120
encryption but we can also use quantum

310
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,839
computers to develop better

311
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:18,000
cyber security so um it's it's a

312
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:21,760
two-sided coin

313
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,279
and then there's a big subfield of

314
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,560
quantum computing called quantum machine

315
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:25,839
learning where people are trying to

316
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,079
figure out whether

317
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:28,959
quantum computing can help us solve some

318
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:32,000
of the

319
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:34,399
bottlenecks of you know

320
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,959
scaling machine learning that we kind of

321
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:41,279
have have today

322
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:44,000
um then one more i guess

323
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:45,760
near term side um we can use quantum

324
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
computers to do things that

325
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,959
are much closer to what physical systems

326
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,920
do so

327
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:52,560
molecular drug design and kind of the

328
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,599
design

329
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:57,439
of um of different materials

330
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,720
for example using organic batteries or

331
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,519
solar cells

332
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:03,040
um are fields where we expect that

333
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:06,240
quantum computing is going to be

334
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:07,360
you know probably providing some kind of

335
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:11,360
advantage sooner than

336
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:14,399
in some in some other domains

337
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,519
now that was like a very brief

338
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:17,440
introduction

339
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:18,880
um i'm going to jump in this part of the

340
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,360
talk a little bit into different

341
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:24,399
paradigms of quantum computing and

342
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:27,120
how does the kind of feel

343
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:27,920
divide a little bit so there's three

344
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,320
major

345
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:31,439
kind of kind of areas there's quantum

346
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,959
annealing

347
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,480
discrete gate based quantum computing

348
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:35,599
and continuous get based on computing

349
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,959
and i'm going to jump into

350
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:40,480
each of these individually

351
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:42,399
all right so in quantum annealing we're

352
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:45,200
trying to find

353
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:46,399
solutions to optimization problems and

354
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:50,320
basically what we do

355
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:52,639
we specify some sort of energy landscape

356
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:54,560
so we define hyper parameters that

357
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:57,680
define the energy landscape

358
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:59,518
and quantum annealing is a process that

359
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:02,560
in the hardware tries to find the

360
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:04,000
minimum energy state of of the system so

361
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:06,560
the system models this

362
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,839
landscape that you can see on the left

363
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:10,560
and the minimum energy

364
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:12,079
state would be the deepest valley of of

365
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:14,399
this diagram so

366
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:17,040
um that corresponds to the conformation

367
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:20,720
of these little proteins that has the

368
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:21,680
lowest energy um and the biggest player

369
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,639
in the field

370
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:26,160
is the company called d-wave they're a

371
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:27,040
canadian company and have been around

372
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:30,160
for

373
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:31,199
a while now more than decades trying to

374
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:34,240
tackle this uh

375
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:37,519
this problem if you look um

376
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:38,800
at the hardware of quantum annealing um

377
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:39,199
you might have seen the picture on the

378
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,079
right

379
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:43,040
that's uh how the d-wave machine looks

380
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:45,839
when it's all

381
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:47,920
uh closed up but in the middle um that's

382
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:50,399
the actual

383
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:51,360
i guess the chandelier of dilution

384
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:53,199
refrigerators

385
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:55,440
and you can see how the temperature is

386
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:58,560
dropping all the way to

387
00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:00,320
um the processor on the bottom so the

388
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:02,239
processor itself runs

389
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,760
on a temperature that is colder than the

390
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:06,639
temperature in the outer space

391
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:09,680
to minimize all the all the noise and

392
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:09,680
thermal fluctuations

393
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:12,880
here you can see how you know the

394
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,320
scaling of

395
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:17,040
the of the size of the chips and the

396
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:18,959
quantum mechanics kind of evolved um

397
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:20,480
it's kind of a self-fulfilling prophecy

398
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:22,000
the company is trying to

399
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:24,000
achieve this uh this exponential

400
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,240
leveling um

401
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,680
pace that kind of reflects the moore's

402
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:30,560
law

403
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,959
and right now actually even bigger chip

404
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,359
is

405
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:35,040
in development so the highest chip on

406
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:38,720
this graph is 2000

407
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:40,719
qubit and i want to keep in mind that

408
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:42,720
between the paradigms the number of

409
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,639
qubits or other metrics don't really

410
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,720
port so if i say this has 2 thousand

411
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:47,040
qubits and in some other architecture we

412
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,360
have

413
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:52,480
on a different number of qubits that's

414
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:55,199
not directly comparable

415
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,720
here we can see that basically this is

416
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:58,639
the architecture of the new generation

417
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,880
v-wave chip

418
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:02,399
on the left we have this 2000 q called

419
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:04,079
the chimera graph

420
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:06,320
and on the right we have this new

421
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:09,599
topology called pegasus

422
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:12,639
and the lines here really depict the

423
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,600
connections between qubits so this kind

424
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:16,560
of kind of

425
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,519
deter i guess yeah determines which

426
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,839
qubits can actually

427
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:21,040
interact in the equation that specifies

428
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:23,120
the energy landscape

429
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:25,760
so the more connected the better but

430
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:29,519
making more connected graphs is

431
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:32,160
more difficult in hardware

432
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:32,800
so this is how you specify the energy

433
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,600
landscape

434
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,880
it's a what we call quadratic

435
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,040
unconstrained binary optimization

436
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:41,519
problem because the

437
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:43,040
variables here are quadratic oh sorry

438
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:46,560
binary and the terms are

439
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:48,800
at most quadratic um that's all you

440
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:51,680
really need to know um

441
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:52,880
i don't need to like deep dive deep into

442
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:55,279
the details how we specify

443
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:56,639
that equation but it's actually not that

444
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:58,160
difficult it's basically we need to

445
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:00,160
encode the constraints

446
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:01,279
of your problem into some sort of energy

447
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:04,800
penalties

448
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:06,320
that if um are violated

449
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:08,079
they no longer correspond to the lowest

450
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:10,720
energy solution of

451
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:12,000
that equation um you can see that the

452
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,519
things aren't perfect here

453
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,000
on this graph you can see that some

454
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:18,079
qubits are missing or some links

455
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,680
are missing and there's a bunch of like

456
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:21,040
more lower level problems

457
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,719
connected with you know programming

458
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:24,880
these devices because

459
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,639
um we have to deal with things like

460
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:29,680
finite resolutions we're going from

461
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:31,279
digital to to analog and

462
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,719
we might not be able to represent you

463
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:34,560
know for example floating point numbers

464
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:37,600
with the precision we would like

465
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:39,279
to have so there are things that

466
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,800
you know kind of coming to the picture

467
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:42,079
that you might not be used to because

468
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:44,719
you're simply dealing with a

469
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:46,079
technology that is more lower level than

470
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,839
you know your regular

471
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:50,959
um classical programming language these

472
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:52,480
days

473
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:54,000
here is an example of how you for

474
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:57,839
example would

475
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,759
um specify a problem so this encodes the

476
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:03,519
energy landscape of a checkerboard

477
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:06,959
and its lowest energy state is basically

478
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:10,000
a state where the neighboring qubits are

479
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:13,919
alternating in value so there you go 0 1

480
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:17,039
0 1 or 1 0 1 0 and you do that by

481
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:18,000
imposing a very simple simple matrix of

482
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:20,559
penalties here

483
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,439
that is defined there over with the j

484
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:22,959
matrix

485
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:25,199
and it's really only like a couple of

486
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:28,319
lines of code using the d-wave uh

487
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:28,319
standard development libraries

488
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:32,400
so the workflow in a quantum annealing

489
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:34,240
world is really you define a problem

490
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,400
you figure out how to you know encode

491
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:38,880
that problem as this equation

492
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,520
and as i mentioned you basically do that

493
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,120
via

494
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,799
imposing different penalties for

495
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:44,239
situations that you don't like so for

496
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:46,559
example in the previous case

497
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:48,240
i would impose penalties for two qubits

498
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:49,760
being the same value

499
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,360
once you have the equation you try to in

500
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,480
what we call embedded on the graph so

501
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,840
you're going to make sure that the

502
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,080
qubits that are

503
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:57,199
talking to each other in your equation

504
00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:00,320
can talk

505
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:01,039
to each other on a hardware and then you

506
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,559
just solve

507
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:04,400
the problem on the hardware and you read

508
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:06,160
out your solution

509
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,440
and if you want to guys play with it

510
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,440
there's d-wave leap

511
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,960
it's a platformer out of d-wave that you

512
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:14,400
can have one minute

513
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:17,280
of free qp time to play with

514
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:18,960
and some further resources um for you

515
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:21,918
guys to look at

516
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,320
okay the universal computing um i'm

517
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:25,600
gonna

518
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:26,399
speed up things a little bit um here we

519
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,959
are constructing

520
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,520
so-called quantum circuits so the big

521
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:33,280
players

522
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:34,400
are ibm google righty

523
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:37,120
and they're each are developing their

524
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:39,919
own respective libraries

525
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:42,080
that you know you can use to specify

526
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:44,880
quantum circuits and

527
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,760
run down the results uh fundamental

528
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,160
building block of

529
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:49,120
quantum computing in this paradigm is

530
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,200
qubit

531
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:52,639
and this is something that you might

532
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,880
have seen previously

533
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,640
um if not it's completely fine qubit is

534
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:59,280
basically specified by

535
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:00,000
two amplitudes that's alpha and beta in

536
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:03,039
this

537
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,840
equation and

538
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:06,640
those squared specify the probabilities

539
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:09,760
of sampling

540
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:13,679
each of these basis states either 0

541
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:15,360
or 1. and

542
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:17,520
basically in order to program the device

543
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:19,918
you construct a circuit so very

544
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:21,440
much similar to you know classical

545
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:24,240
circuit logic you

546
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:25,840
specify quantum circuits uh you you

547
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:29,039
basically have either

548
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:32,159
operations that touch one two or

549
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:34,080
multiple qubits and

550
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,919
by imposing those operations you alter

551
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:37,520
the state of the system we alter what we

552
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:39,360
call the wave function

553
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,720
and at the end of the computation you

554
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:44,399
just read out the

555
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:45,679
the result so for example one of the

556
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,160
things that you can do you can basically

557
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:48,480
introduce

558
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:50,640
entanglement it's one of the usual

559
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:53,360
building blocks of

560
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:54,799
quantum algorithms and you do that using

561
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:57,199
a hadamard gate

562
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:57,840
hadamard gate is nothing else a certain

563
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,480
rotation

564
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:01,600
of uh of the qubit because we can see

565
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:04,880
the result of the rotation

566
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:06,799
um here for two basis states another

567
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:08,960
gate that you can use is a c not gate

568
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:10,559
and if you were to combine the two you

569
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:13,360
can actually

570
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:14,720
reach this combination of states which

571
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:17,280
kind of

572
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:19,120
imposes that we can only get zero zero

573
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:21,678
or one one out of the system

574
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,239
which we call um entangled state or

575
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:25,919
maximum

576
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:29,760
integral state um so we would do this

577
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:31,520
in uh um using the we get this library

578
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:34,400
as described over here so you can again

579
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:37,440
see that you know it's a fairly simple

580
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:38,159
way to specify the circuit actually it

581
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,320
generates

582
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:41,600
a circuit in a language called quill

583
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:44,000
which is uh on the

584
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:45,280
on the right um so it's very much like

585
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,960
assembler like

586
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:51,360
in this particular sense

587
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,480
and here the mo the workflow is again

588
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,240
very similar

589
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:56,000
um you go from your professional problem

590
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,039
then you you know figure out the quantum

591
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,440
algorithm

592
00:20:57,039 --> 00:21:00,640
you generate a quantum circuit for that

593
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,919
algorithm and

594
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,919
you compile it to the hardware so the

595
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:05,840
hardware can only use certain

596
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:07,280
operations so there's a step called

597
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:09,760
compilation where you

598
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:12,000
make sure that the gates that you're

599
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:13,520
using are actually implemented on the

600
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,120
on the hardware and then you run your

601
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:17,200
thing on the quantum processor and read

602
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:19,760
out the result

603
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:21,280
okay another paradigm and the last one

604
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:23,600
that i want to talk about this

605
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,480
continuous variable quantum computing

606
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,959
and here

607
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:28,400
instead of having these you know two

608
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:31,120
basis states you have a

609
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:32,559
continuum of basis states so instead of

610
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,918
qubit we call the

611
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:35,600
computational building block the queue

612
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:37,360
mode

613
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,639
and uh for example one of the

614
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:41,840
applications or one of the

615
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:44,640
kind of building blocks of these systems

616
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:46,080
is quantum boson sampling that you can

617
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,760
use to

618
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:49,280
you know sample from complex pros or

619
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:51,039
distributions um

620
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:54,240
it's well suited for graph hormones for

621
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:57,360
example um we wrote a paper on using

622
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:59,200
gaussian blossom sampling for certain

623
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:01,039
molecule docking problems so that was

624
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,760
basically trying to find maximum clicks

625
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:03,919
and

626
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:05,600
certain certain graphs that we generated

627
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:07,600
so it's it's really

628
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:09,199
you can see that you can have to combine

629
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,879
you know knowledge from

630
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,799
quantum computing with knowledge from

631
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:15,679
computer science in order to

632
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:16,320
achieve useful results and the biggest

633
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:18,960
player

634
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:20,480
um in this field is xanadu and actually

635
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:23,120
we have a speaker from xander here

636
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:24,720
today so he's going to tell you more

637
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:27,199
about

638
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,840
this domain more resources if you guys

639
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:31,760
are interested

640
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:33,918
you can find us in a slide deck so

641
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:35,600
at the end of the talk i want to kind of

642
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:38,400
talk about a little bit about

643
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:39,360
how can you become part of this and uh

644
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,679
you know what are

645
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,399
the things that you can actually do to

646
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:45,440
um

647
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:46,799
you know help the field out

648
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:50,080
the nice thing about quantum computing

649
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:53,200
is that um there's a big push

650
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:55,039
um in the community for the things to

651
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,559
happen in the open source way

652
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:59,120
not only the research itself but also

653
00:22:56,559 --> 00:23:01,280
like all the underlying building blocks

654
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:02,158
um the libraries are available open

655
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:04,960
source

656
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:06,480
and uh you know it really helps

657
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:11,280
reproducibility but also

658
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:11,280
it helps more people join the field

659
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:15,600
so like all of these not all these many

660
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:19,120
of these quantum hardware providers

661
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:22,399
are also providing open source

662
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:25,120
libraries to program their devices

663
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:28,080
or play with their quantum virtual

664
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:29,918
machines quantum simulators

665
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:31,678
and that is that is really nice for us

666
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:34,840
to be able to

667
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:37,280
you know spread the knowledge

668
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:39,918
the kind of implicit thing about the

669
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:41,840
field is that it it comes from

670
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:43,760
you know academia to to a degree and

671
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:45,520
many people working on these open source

672
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:48,240
projects are scientists

673
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:50,720
um and they're doing a great job but

674
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,919
many of them are not software engineers

675
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:54,799
by training

676
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:55,200
and there's a huge potential in um you

677
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:57,600
know

678
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:59,200
more of software engineers being

679
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:02,399
involved in helping

680
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:04,559
you know scale and design apis and and

681
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:06,720
just build this system in a way that

682
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:09,600
follow the best practices of

683
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,600
software engineering

684
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:16,320
so there's a huge list

685
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:17,279
of projects on our website the links are

686
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:20,639
on the right

687
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:23,039
that you can use to see a um

688
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:23,679
you know quite exhausting list of

689
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:24,960
different

690
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:27,440
projects in different different areas

691
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:30,080
and i want to mention some of those here

692
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:31,279
so these are things like quantum

693
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,320
compilers or quantum circuit

694
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:35,120
optimization

695
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:36,960
where you try to make sure that you

696
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:38,399
modify the circuit in such a way that

697
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:40,720
you let's say optimize the number of

698
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:43,039
gates and at the same time you produce

699
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:45,679
the same kind of a result

700
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:47,279
at the end there are things like

701
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:48,320
development of control systems so we're

702
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:51,760
actually going to have a speaker

703
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:53,439
today speaking speaking about um a open

704
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:55,120
source project for control systems and

705
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:58,559
and quantum computing

706
00:24:55,120 --> 00:25:01,120
um we have things like quantum games or

707
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:02,240
ide tools visualization tools so a lot

708
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:04,080
of these things that need to be

709
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:06,320
developed now we can draw the parallels

710
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:09,120
that i was speaking about

711
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:11,039
in the case of machine learning um a lot

712
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:14,000
of work needs to be done

713
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:14,559
for us to be able to like do research

714
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,640
and

715
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:18,000
really develop this field further and

716
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:20,799
also that work

717
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,760
is um you know fundamental software

718
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:25,600
engineering

719
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:27,600
uh basically waiting to be fulfilled

720
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:30,158
so feel free to jump into any of those

721
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:33,199
things um commute is very very open

722
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:35,279
and uh i'm certain that they would love

723
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,400
you know a helping hand from people that

724
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:38,480
can you know

725
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:40,640
tell them how to structure or package

726
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:42,080
their python library better and put them

727
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,799
put it on pipe because maybe right now

728
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:44,639
it's on

729
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:46,480
github and it's not even installable for

730
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:47,679
wi-fi so

731
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,279
there are a lot of opportunities like

732
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:49,840
that if you guys want to jump into space

733
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:52,880
and and

734
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:54,959
learn more about the area

735
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:56,240
and if you guys feel even more

736
00:25:54,960 --> 00:26:00,080
adventurous

737
00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:00,880
there's a incubator that is dedicated to

738
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,480
quantum

739
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:04,720
computing slash quantum machine learning

740
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,360
actually sean is in the room sean is one

741
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:07,200
of the

742
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:09,199
people organizing it sean if you could

743
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,960
wave your hand so that people know

744
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:12,400
they could talk to you in in a break if

745
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:14,559
they're if they're interested

746
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,679
and uh that's actually where my company

747
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:18,960
started so

748
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:20,799
uh shout out to these guys and uh

749
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:23,120
if you want to help with uh you know

750
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:24,080
education and outreach you can speak to

751
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,439
me and mark

752
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:27,918
we're running the quantum open source

753
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:29,600
foundation you can join our slack

754
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:30,880

00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:57,279
grand

768
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:59,520
program from uh from will called dry

769
00:26:57,279 --> 00:27:01,279
funds so that's unitary.fund

770
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:03,360
you can check out if you are interested

771
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:05,200
in doing a project but you

772
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:07,199
not sure if you could you know support

773
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:09,279
yourself there's a way to get funding

774
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:11,279
for that as well

775
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:13,440
all right so that thanks thank you for

776
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:21,840
the attention and

777
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:21,840
let's uh wait for the next

778
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:26,790
[Applause]
