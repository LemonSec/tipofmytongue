1
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:08,000
i work with geo server which we're going

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:10,480
to be talking about today

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,920
geotools which is a data access library

4
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,400
does a lot of rendering does a lot of

5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:16,000
that

6
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:18,080
geo for geospatial jts topology suite

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,279
which is the rocket science

8
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:23,439
of the geospatial uh community this is

9
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:26,720
the library that does all the geometries

10
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:27,359
without geometry and uh and being able

11
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,439
to compare

12
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:31,039
shapes we wouldn't have an open source

13
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:33,440
gis industry at all

14
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:35,440
um i just help out with that project i'm

15
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:38,000
not one of the rocket scientists

16
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,960
um i work on a couple other projects

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
imogen and

18
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,719
and udig i also volunteer with the

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,480
community

20
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:49,200
so i volunteer with the osgo foundation

21
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:51,279
i just wrapped up my second tour as osgo

22
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:54,160
director

23
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,960
i serve on the incubation committee

24
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,360
helping

25
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,520
new project teams not to be embarrassing

26
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:02,239
on the internet

27
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,080
i'm also the geotools project officer i

28
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:06,798
also help out with the marketing team

29
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:09,679
because without users a lot of our open

30
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:11,600
source projects would get very lonely

31
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:14,560
i also do some volunteer work with the

32
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,559
eclipse foundation

33
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:18,320
now there's several popular geoserver

34
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,799
talks

35
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:22,080
we do an annual kind of team update a

36
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:23,759
tour of what's new

37
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,439
this is great for folks that already use

38
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:28,159
geoserver

39
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:30,158
we do a geoserver feature frenzy this is

40
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:32,159
all the stuff that's cool and exciting

41
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:33,600
and kind of the headline features

42
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,680
that we wouldn't normally get to talk

43
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,439
about every year

44
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,119
and we also do one called geoserver

45
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:41,600
ecosystem where we

46
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:44,000
show a lot of the crazy systems that

47
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:46,479
people have set her up

48
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,360
worldwide and that's very inspirational

49
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:50,000
it gives

50
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:51,200
folks a chance to see what what's

51
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,399
possible

52
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,040
there's a problem with all of these

53
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:55,759
talks every time i i help out with one

54
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,960
of them

55
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:00,240
i get a question so what does geo server

56
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:03,759
actually do

57
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,759
and so that's what this talk is about

58
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,959
so let me start with what geoserver is

59
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,799
for

60
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:12,959
geoserver has a vision right on the top

61
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,840
of our homepage geoserver is an open

62
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:17,120
source server

63
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:19,440
for sharing geospatial data we're really

64
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:21,040
passionate about sharing data

65
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,200
the project was founded out of like a

66
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,440
community project in new york to like

67
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:28,079
help the community map all the trees in

68
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,760
their neighborhood

69
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,599
we're here because we want people to be

70
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,200
able to share a map and

71
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:34,959
we don't want you to stop just at

72
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,839
sharing a map we want you to share the

73
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:39,120
data behind the map

74
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,040
and it's not enough just to share the

75
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,640
data we want to support editing

76
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:45,040
we want to make sure those community

77
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:48,238
members can actually edit the data

78
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:51,200
not just consume it blindly

79
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:51,840
so this is the foundation principle of

80
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,958
how

81
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,239
our software project was formed our

82
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,720
approach

83
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:00,959
how we're trying to address this design

84
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,959
for interoperability

85
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,080
we actually take that pretty seriously

86
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:06,239
to publish data from

87
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,840
any major data source using open

88
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:09,360
standards so i just want to unpack that

89
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:12,000
a bit

90
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:14,640
geoserver doesn't want to lock you in

91
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,200
we're not a vendor

92
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,000
we want you to share your data with as

93
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:21,280
many folks as

94
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,680
possible and to that end geo server is

95
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,840
kind of

96
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:26,159
open-ended it can be considered a

97
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:29,200
framework where we gradually plug

98
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:31,280
more and more protocols in over time so

99
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:33,280
once you set up your geoserver

100
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,200
and you're publishing your data as you

101
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,440
upgrade you can reach more and more

102
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:39,599
clients

103
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:42,079
we also don't want you to have to like

104
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:44,399
import your data into geoserver

105
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,239
it hangs out in the middle if you're one

106
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:49,599
of these organizations that

107
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:51,920
has like oracle as a as a

108
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:54,079
data policy well you're going to be able

109
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,798
to use geoserver to take the data out of

110
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:58,400
oracle

111
00:03:54,799 --> 00:04:02,080
and share it with the open community

112
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:04,879
if you are in the cloud and have like um

113
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,200
geomesa or mongodb you'll be able to

114
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:08,239
take

115
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:10,159
geoserver and have and use it as a front

116
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:12,400
end so people can access all your cloud

117
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:13,920
data

118
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,560
and we do start with the industry

119
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:19,440
standards it's the opposite

120
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:21,040
of a not invented here syndrome if we

121
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,840
have to invent something

122
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:25,040
in isolation chances are we're taking

123
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,400
the wrong approach

124
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:29,120
we're always looking for folks to

125
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:32,159
collaborate with

126
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,680
so most people come to geo server just

127
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:37,199
wanting to publish a map

128
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:40,479
so each data set in geo server speak

129
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:42,320
is a layer of content you can actually

130
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:44,479
gather those layers into a group

131
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:46,560
and arrange them in order to like make a

132
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:48,080
little base map or something

133
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,080
there's also a small little layer

134
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:52,159
preview that you can use to like test

135
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:54,080
things out locally

136
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,160
geoserver in this case is the rendering

137
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:58,320
engine so it's producing maps

138
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,800
for clients on the web desktop mobile

139
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,800
etc

140
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,198
we've got more than one approach

141
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,520
remember it's just the concept of

142
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:08,960
publishing a layer

143
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,960
you might publish it as a map where

144
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,239
people can zoom and pan around and do

145
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,159
ad-hoc queries

146
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,639
you might publish an entire tile set of

147
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,400
data for like mobile clients

148
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:19,919
the result of publishing a map doesn't

149
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:23,359
always look like an image

150
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:24,639
like it doesn't have to be a png svg and

151
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,120
kml output

152
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:27,759
um they're little vector formats that

153
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,440
include

154
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:31,039
baked in styling information on how

155
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,400
they're supposed to be drawn

156
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:34,240
you can also have extensions for

157
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:36,000
geoserver that get it to generate out

158
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:38,639
pdfs

159
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,880
and one i personally like is vector

160
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:43,600
tiles which are pre-processed

161
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:45,280
um little vector data sets uh and

162
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,520
they're pre-processed for client-side

163
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:49,758
rendering

164
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:51,198
i'm just gonna breathe there everyone's

165
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:54,479
looking stunned

166
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:58,080
how am i doing so far there's a question

167
00:05:54,479 --> 00:06:00,000
i'll try i guess i should have got some

168
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,680
water

169
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,600
the next thing we can do is vector data

170
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,800
publishing so in the spirit of open

171
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,319
we're really

172
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,240
wanting to set ourselves up to share the

173
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:10,400
data behind the map

174
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,080
and we've got interfaces that support

175
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,520
queries and a whole wide range of

176
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:16,479
different out formats

177
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:18,560
from json to kml to zip shapefiles if

178
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:22,080
that's what you like to work with

179
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:26,080
who likes zip shape files

180
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:26,080
wow this is a developer conference

181
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,160
i was just at a qgis user meeting and uh

182
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:31,680
yeah

183
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,280
they're they're in the middle of the

184
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,560
transition from shape files to

185
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:37,280
geopackage and

186
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,280
there's terror

187
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:41,919
we also support vector editing so we

188
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:43,680
really want to make sure those community

189
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:44,639
members can get a hold of and interact

190
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,319
with the data

191
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,000
we did make sure editing is off by

192
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:49,840
default but we only did that

193
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,360
recently so if you've been using

194
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:53,039
geoserver for years

195
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,560
check your settings you might be letting

196
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:57,039
anybody on the internet edit your

197
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,039
information

198
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:00,240
we also do provide direct raster access

199
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,880
now

200
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,639
keep in mind for the vector and the and

201
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,159
the raster access

202
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:08,319
geoserver is not providing you an

203
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,800
interactive experience that's up to a

204
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:13,280
client like qgis on the desktop

205
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:16,479
or open layers or leaflet in a web

206
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:19,520
mapping environment

207
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:21,840
okay so you get a general purpose of

208
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:26,159
what geoserver is for

209
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:30,880
who here owns data they want to share

210
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:34,319
a couple people that's great

211
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:35,919
so geo server configuration

212
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:37,520
when you use launch geo server there's

213
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:40,400
this little welcome screen

214
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:41,440
and it's it's a little web configuration

215
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,440
app

216
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:45,599
that you can use to configure and

217
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,360
publish your different data products

218
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:48,719
i need to stop at this point and say

219
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,759
this is not

220
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,879
geoserver this is just a little tool to

221
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:55,680
configure

222
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:57,599
the real services the real web services

223
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,680
are over here on the right hand side

224
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:01,440
the different service capabilities and

225
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,360
endpoints which

226
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:05,680
clients use to programmatically access

227
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:09,440
the data

228
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:11,520
yep so if you're going into production

229
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,560
you probably want to configure your you

230
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,878
know your apache

231
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,400
or something to hide these configuration

232
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:18,560
screens there's no reason to share that

233
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:21,599
with the public

234
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:23,840
my examples use natural earth so

235
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:24,960
i'm going to walk through how geoserver

236
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,359
is set up

237
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:29,280
to begin with your data is collected

238
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,599
into individual workspaces

239
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,958
these are like folders which you can use

240
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:35,838
to organize

241
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:37,838
content there's a few little tweaks i

242
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:40,800
got to talk about here

243
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:42,000
each workspace is considered a distinct

244
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:44,000
xml namespace

245
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
for all of those little formats that

246
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
really like xml because

247
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,320
the 1990s were fun and they had good

248
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,320
music

249
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:55,439
the workspace also has a little name

250
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:58,000
that's used in a prefix when we're

251
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:00,080
talking to the individual layers

252
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,600
so we can go through we can hit new

253
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,480
workspace fill in a little bit of

254
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,360
information

255
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:07,839
and we've got a new empty workspace to

256
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,839
to work with there

257
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:11,120
advanced thing to talk about each

258
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:13,839
workspace

259
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:15,120
can be its own distinct web service so

260
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:17,360
if you're supporting

261
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:20,560
dozens of teams you might want to set up

262
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,560
a workspace for each team

263
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,760
next we get into data sources so data

264
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:27,360
sources is

265
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:28,399
geoserver being connected to a directory

266
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,760
of shape files

267
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:34,800
or you know two terabytes of

268
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:39,439
geotiffs in a folder or

269
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:41,120
a cloud service or a database um

270
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,800
the data store name is internal to

271
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:45,920
geoserver that doesn't show up

272
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,640
on any of the protocols that way you can

273
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,199
change

274
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:50,480
what service you're using behind a layer

275
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,519
and no one

276
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54,959
none of the clients have to know so we

277
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:57,040
can go through we can

278
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:59,920
uh add a new data store in this case i'm

279
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:01,680
pointing it to a directory of shapefiles

280
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:03,680
so my connection parameters aren't very

281
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:06,319
interesting it's just a single

282
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:07,920
path on my server and it's the same

283
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,240
thing here when i'm publishing

284
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,760
a geotiff i'm pointing to a single path

285
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,360
on the file system

286
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:16,399
i should have had an example here

287
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,399
working with a database

288
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:22,320
so pausing workspace

289
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:24,319
inside the workspace we've got various

290
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,120
different data sources which we're using

291
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,440
to connect

292
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:30,160
to the information that's already there

293
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:33,120
in our organization

294
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:34,560
uh for vector layers um geosurface

295
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,360
publishing information is distinct

296
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:38,000
layers

297
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,440
we've got a little uh we've got several

298
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,120
things you need to check when you

299
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,800
when you publish you want to make sure

300
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:45,600
your layer has a name

301
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:46,959
and a title the name is actually machine

302
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,920
readable and it's used on

303
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:51,439
all the protocols and urls and the title

304
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,959
is human readable

305
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,040
we also really need to make sure that

306
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:57,359
the spatial reference system

307
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:59,120
and the bounds are correct if we don't

308
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,000
have that information correct clients

309
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:03,920
won't be able to draw

310
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:06,480
our data in the right spot each protocol

311
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:08,319
is going to use a different term for how

312
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,320
they publish the information

313
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,399
sometimes a layer will be called a layer

314
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,160
sometimes it'll be called a feature type

315
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:15,839
sometimes it's a coverage or a grid

316
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,760
coverage or a tile set

317
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:20,720
it really just depends on what protocol

318
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,720
the client is using

319
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:24,399
so in this case i'm going to the culture

320
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,640
data store i

321
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:28,000
set up before i'm choosing one of the

322
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,439
shape files for my directory of

323
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,079
shapefiles

324
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,760
and i'm hitting publish to start out

325
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:36,239
with i'm filling in the name

326
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:39,120
and the and the title and i'm sure

327
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:40,399
nobody can read that

328
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,880
and then i'm going through here and

329
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:44,880
double checking the bounds

330
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:46,000
and the bounding box and in this case

331
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:50,079
i'm generating those

332
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,079
by having it look at the data set

333
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,360
same thing for a raster data layer i can

334
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,600
go through and publish a raster

335
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,560
geotiffs only have one data product

336
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,920
inside of them

337
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:02,399
but if i'm working with something like

338
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:05,519
netcdf i might have to pick and choose

339
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:08,560
which data product inside the netcdf

340
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:08,560
bundle i want to publish

341
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:13,200
okay so next up i've got a layer group

342
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,519
so

343
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:17,920
the most common use for a layer group is

344
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:21,360
to bundle up several layers together

345
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:24,079
in order to draw a base map the layers

346
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:26,000
are listed in draw order

347
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:28,319
you can also use layer groups to kind of

348
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,240
construct a table of content structure

349
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:33,120
so like a series of folders to organize

350
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,120
your your data

351
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,480
so i can go to layer group add a new

352
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:41,680
layer

353
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:43,519
provide a name and a title and then i

354
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:45,439
need to go down to the layer section and

355
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:46,639
add my layers in order

356
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,639
and that's the order they're going to be

357
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:51,440
drawn in so my raster data

358
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:52,000
i want to draw first and then my vector

359
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,760
data

360
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,800
and if i had point data i draw that on

361
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:59,279
top and that's really unintuitive for me

362
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,800
so this mistake of getting things in the

363
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,360
wrong order is that one of the most

364
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:05,279
common

365
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:06,880
geoserver kind of learning troubles

366
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:08,720
after we've got our layers we can go

367
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,360
ahead and calculate the bounds and the

368
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,519
coordinate

369
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,560
reference system it's hard to do that

370
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:16,480
before we have content

371
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:16,479
which is why we added the layers first

372
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:22,000
okay take a break how's that working for

373
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:25,040
people

374
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:28,480
going too fast can people hear me

375
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:28,480
a couple people good

376
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,240
next i want to talk about styling

377
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:36,160
geosaver has a bad reputation with

378
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:38,560
styling the

379
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:39,600
styling engine the drawing engine we use

380
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:43,040
from geotools is

381
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:46,160
really super powerful but

382
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:48,639
geoserver out of the box uh supports a

383
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:49,600
format called sld or style layer

384
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:52,480
descriptor

385
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,519
which is all done in xml but here's the

386
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:56,720
secret

387
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:59,519
nobody wanted you to write that by hand

388
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:00,720
um we really want you to use a tool like

389
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:03,839
qgis

390
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:06,480
or geostyler or any of the other tools

391
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:08,240
to generate your sld

392
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,000
and we've started to see extensions

393
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:13,199
developed where people have

394
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,519
human readable css or yaml

395
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:18,880
style definitions which makes geoserver

396
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:18,880
a lot more accessible to people

397
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,480
so we really recommend if you're a human

398
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:24,079
you

399
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,000
write your style in something intended

400
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:29,040
for humans

401
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:31,519
there's built-in styles uh provided

402
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:33,360
one thing that's interesting is each

403
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:34,560
workspace has a style folder

404
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:37,600
and that's where you're going to store

405
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:40,638
any icons or fonts that you want to use

406
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,639
for your cartography

407
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:45,120
so i can add a new style in this case

408
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,439
i'm

409
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:49,040
adding it to my workspace i'm calling it

410
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:52,639
map color 9

411
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:54,639
and i'm choosing the ysld format

412
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:56,639
which someone very carefully thought of

413
00:14:54,639 --> 00:15:00,480
as a joke but it's a yaml

414
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:03,920
version of s the sld concept

415
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:05,920
so i can hit generate

416
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:07,680
the geoserver style editor lets you look

417
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:10,319
at a layer preview as you're

418
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:12,000
updating your style so i'm going to go

419
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:15,600
ahead and switch over to the preview tab

420
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:17,760
and have a look i'm going to fill in a

421
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:22,560
little snippet of yaml here where i'm

422
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:25,120
going to recode map color 9 from one to

423
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:26,239
a color from two to a color and so on so

424
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,880
this is a very

425
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:30,560
well it's more human readable than than

426
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:32,240
xml

427
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,920
so this is a little bit more

428
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:36,560
approachable

429
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:37,360
here's what that looks like and then

430
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,839
finally

431
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:42,320
i can go over to the publishing tab and

432
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:44,959
i can associate this style

433
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:47,519
with my state province shape layer i

434
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:50,719
published earlier

435
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:50,720
and here's what that looks like

436
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,880
so it's my hope that we've managed to

437
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:57,519
introduce

438
00:15:54,880 --> 00:16:00,320
four concepts workspace which is a

439
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:01,920
folder to organize your things

440
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:04,240
data stores which are used to connect

441
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:06,000
you to the data in your organization

442
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:08,880
layers which is where you published

443
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,880
individual data products and styles

444
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,399
where your

445
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:14,560
where you're choosing how you want those

446
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:18,560
drawn

447
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:21,199
okay just checking time

448
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:23,279
i'm not too bad for time so i've got a

449
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:27,599
great question how does it work

450
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:30,639
who here is programmed in java before

451
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:33,519
okay how many people have used spring

452
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:34,480
okay so geo server is a spring based

453
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:36,880
application

454
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:38,720
it didn't used to be uh geo server used

455
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:41,680
to be done in a system called

456
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:43,920
struts i think is that a system i'm

457
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:46,719
trying to forget it it was terrible

458
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,040
um the other interesting framework we

459
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,800
use

460
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:51,040
is one called wicket has anyone used

461
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:54,160
wicket before

462
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:55,839
it's a ui framework which only a java

463
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:58,959
developer could love

464
00:16:55,839 --> 00:17:00,399
the reason we like it is because it's

465
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:04,399
modular

466
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:05,439
and geoserver is a very fiercely modular

467
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:08,640
application

468
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:10,880
we really want all our extensions and

469
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,959
community modules to be distinct

470
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:14,240
so people can have the code and their

471
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:17,360
code can also include

472
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:18,559
user interface contributions um we've

473
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:20,799
got a little

474
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:23,199
so the web administration is done with

475
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:26,079
wicked and open layers and so on

476
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:26,640
our rest api uh we transitioned from

477
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:28,399
wrestlet

478
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:30,400
over to spring model view controller a

479
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,160
few years ago

480
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:34,240
the core geoserver application is

481
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,679
creatively called dispatcher

482
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,280
so that's the thing that takes in

483
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:39,280
requests and

484
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,399
uh dispatches it off to the appropriate

485
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:43,918
service like

486
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:46,960
wms or wcs or so on

487
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:48,720
we actually have an embedded an entirely

488
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:50,320
otherwise innocent application called

489
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:53,120
geoweb cache

490
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:54,559
you can actually download geo web cache

491
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:57,199
and install it

492
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:59,520
on your own it's a perfectly good kind

493
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:01,039
of tile proxy thing written in java

494
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:03,360
but in this case we're using it as a

495
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:04,960
library

496
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:07,039
underneath the covers geoserver has a

497
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:09,039
catalog which is where we store

498
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:10,080
all our configuration we also have a

499
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:12,240
data directory

500
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:15,360
where we were storing all those files

501
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:17,200
and fonts and icons

502
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,559
and the resource pool represents our

503
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,880
live connections to all the different

504
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:22,639
data sources

505
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,799
i just wanted to bring these ones up

506
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:26,960
because when we look into advanced

507
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:28,320
deployments of geoserver people will

508
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:31,360
take these components

509
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:34,559
and plug in alternates

510
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:36,240
under the covers we use spring geotools

511
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:39,440
and an image processing library called

512
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,440
java advanced imaging

513
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:46,080
and that's what this slide says

514
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,720
okay so we've got a lot of effort put

515
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:49,439
into g

516
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:51,360
into keeping geoserver modular the

517
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,559
formal modules we have are called

518
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:54,879
extensions

519
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:56,000
so these are actually part of geoserver

520
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,080
they're released as

521
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,000
part every time we make a release they

522
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,600
have the same version number

523
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,840
the only reason they're an extension

524
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:05,600
isn't is not because they're not good

525
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:07,039
it's because we want to keep geoserver

526
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,879
as small as possible

527
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:10,799
and have you only install the things you

528
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:13,760
use

529
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:14,240
so oracle is an example of connecting to

530
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,720
a new

531
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:19,520
data type we also have entire other

532
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:21,440
services like web processing service

533
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,720
that you could install and geo server

534
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:25,520
would you know

535
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:26,720
learn to speak uh and manage entirely

536
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:29,918
new set of uh

537
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:33,600
challenges um collect into cloud

538
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:35,360
things like geo mesa or mongodb

539
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:37,360
we also have a really robust security

540
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:39,439
model so there's a

541
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:41,918
an extension called geofence where it

542
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:44,080
rips out the geoserver security system

543
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:45,919
and puts in a really sophisticated one

544
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,720
where you can limit editing to just a

545
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:49,600
geofence

546
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:53,840
area and one of my personal favorite

547
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:53,840
extensions is one that does vector tiles

548
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:58,000
we also have a scary kind of

549
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:01,280
demilitarized zone

550
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,480
called community modules this dates from

551
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:05,678
when we were hosted in

552
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:09,360
in subversion and so it was easier to

553
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:11,360
give people a little community play area

554
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:12,479
in order to support grad students and so

555
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,719
on

556
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:16,400
over time we've actually found that

557
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:19,760
consultants are working here

558
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:22,320
so they are doing some work in public

559
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:23,440
for their customers but they haven't yet

560
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,678
met our

561
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:27,120
our requirements for documentation and

562
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:30,159
quality assurance

563
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:32,320
so if you see a community module it's an

564
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:34,400
opportunity to pick up the code yourself

565
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:37,039
or to see who's interested in supporting

566
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:40,960
it it's very much as a use

567
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:40,960
very much use at your own risk

568
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,959
so examples of community modules here's

569
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:47,600
one which

570
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:48,960
backs all of the catalog and data

571
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:51,760
directory onto a

572
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:53,760
onto a blob store and that's really nice

573
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:56,158
if you're in amazon web services

574
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:57,600
you can store all of your configuration

575
00:20:56,159 --> 00:21:00,400
in rws

576
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:01,280
and cluster for example backup and

577
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:03,280
restore

578
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:05,840
pick up all of your configuration from

579
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:11,440
test and deploy it into production

580
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:13,520
map ml sap hana all kinds of stuff

581
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,799
so just to wrap up we've got a project

582
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,879
steering committee

583
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:19,039
we're part of the osgo foundation so

584
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:23,039
they've reviewed our processes

585
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:23,039
we try and keep things open and fair

586
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:26,559
we do have a strong history of

587
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:29,200
collaboration this

588
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:30,480
project has seen many entire companies

589
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:34,320
come and go so

590
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:37,840
it was started by open planning project

591
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:40,158
i don't know 2002 or something like that

592
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:41,360
the initial core team of companies was

593
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:44,799
open planning project

594
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:46,879
geosolutions refractions research

595
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:49,200
we've seen government departments come

596
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:51,120
in and take part

597
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:53,120
so we try and keep our event we try and

598
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:58,239
keep our steering committee with a mix

599
00:21:53,120 --> 00:22:00,559
of skills and backgrounds okay so

600
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,600
try it out there's binary there's a web

601
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:03,840
archive

602
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:05,039
um we don't have any windows or mac

603
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,959
installers right now

604
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:09,679
our build server had some vandalism last

605
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:11,919
year and we haven't restored those

606
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:14,320
docker there's a bazillion docker images

607
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:15,679
out there but nothing official

608
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:18,720
and there's a few companies that are

609
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:18,720
willing to offer you hosting

610
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,840
thanks

611
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:33,600
sure if you don't have questions i have

612
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:35,840
questions for you so speak up

613
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,840
yep

614
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:43,678
so moving features

615
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:45,520
i'm not sure we do offer animations and

616
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:46,480
lots of our raster support is temporal

617
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,158
based and

618
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:50,640
a lot of our featured data sets can have

619
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:52,000
a time component

620
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:55,120
but i don't think there's anything

621
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:57,440
specific for oh what do you call it like

622
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,439
um

623
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:02,480
i can't like bearings and so on

624
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,840
okay

625
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:15,679
yeah i'm not aware of any r d right now

626
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:18,720
i do know one of the community modules

627
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:20,640
is working on the ogc apis for example

628
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:22,080
those community modules are often where

629
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:24,880
a lot of

630
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:27,520
like ogc test bed work takes place not

631
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:31,039
all of it sees the light of day

632
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:31,039
yeah sir

633
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:39,440
weirdos um yes maybe we should talk

634
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:41,679
about stuff

635
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:43,679
right i'm just wondering do you know

636
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:47,200
geocyan

637
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:50,400
no okay that's a geology format

638
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:52,080
and cyro spent like 10 million

639
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:55,840
teaching geo server how to do all that

640
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:55,840
stuff right so just ask questions

641
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,559
right

642
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:06,799
i understand one cottage industry for

643
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,000
consultants

644
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:10,559
is writing a data store to read abnormal

645
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,279
things

646
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:15,200
so geo server can make them consumable

647
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:17,679
by others

648
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,880
maybe we should talk after it seems like

649
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:21,120
a challenge

650
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:22,799
there was someone over here sir what

651
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:24,559
city are you based out of

652
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:26,720
that's a great question i'm really

653
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:27,918
jet-lagged so i think i'm gradually

654
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:31,440
moving east

655
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:34,559
i think i'm probably at halifax now

656
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:37,679
no i'm i'm out of vancouver island

657
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:39,440
um so go to vancouver fall in the ocean

658
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:42,559
go a little bit further

659
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:44,640
so victoria bc but you mentioned it's a

660
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:46,879
netherlands-based company it is they're

661
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:50,480
in a little village called benacom

662
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:52,640
oh okay yeah

663
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:53,600
i just joined them so i i know nothing

664
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:57,520
okay

665
00:24:53,600 --> 00:25:01,360
okay the footprint

666
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:03,918
yeah the memories oh um it's actually

667
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:04,479
not as scary as you would expect so it's

668
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:07,120
been

669
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,679
it's been designed from the ground up to

670
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:10,158
stream

671
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:12,480
so it never loads the data into memory

672
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:15,679
it's always streaming the features past

673
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:16,960
the image processing um engine in

674
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:20,080
particular is really good

675
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:21,520
using a on-demand processing

676
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:23,760
i can't remember the right raster

677
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:27,200
buzzword for it for that

678
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:29,120
so i i've certainly run geoservers in

679
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:31,120
like 256 mags

680
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:32,799
i've seen people throw lots of memory at

681
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:34,959
it and have no effect

682
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:36,720
so it really depends on your data set

683
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:40,840
how much memory would

684
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:43,440
help you does that

685
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:43,439
help i don't know

686
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:49,520
okay there's versions of geo server that

687
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:52,400
have been set up

688
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:52,960
as little spring boot applications for

689
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:55,840
cloud

690
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:58,960
i'm not sure i do you recommend them

691
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:58,959
anyone's done any packaging

692
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:02,400
there's a reason why not that java

693
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:05,039
advanced imaging thing

694
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:06,720
is not open source it's a sun binary

695
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:09,120
something or other license

696
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:10,000
i actually got oracle to donate the code

697
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:13,199
to me actually this

698
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,799
guy did so i'm trying to rescue that bit

699
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,559
of code

700
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:17,840
but i didn't get into the java dev room

701
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:25,840
i'm here with you so

702
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:27,918
it might take longer yeah

703
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,918
you
