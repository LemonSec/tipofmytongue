1
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:10,080
okay

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:12,080
they can go so hi i am ashed

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,759
and instead of talking about my project

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:17,359
i'm going to talk about yours

5
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:20,480
um it for the clickbait

6
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:22,800
title but in general like okay

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,760
forget about your project i don't want

8
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,080
to talk about

9
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,160
contributors and anything i have a great

10
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:31,198
new idea for a game

11
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:34,320
get this i want an

12
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:36,239
mmo where you go around and you're like

13
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,680
itching you have this itches that you

14
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:40,640
want to scratch

15
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,960
and and you know you find other players

16
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,960
and

17
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,120
you go around and they have their own

18
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,760
itches and you are comparing itches

19
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,239
what it is to me what it is to you and

20
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,480
like

21
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:51,279
it's cooperative maybe our itches are

22
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,879
compatible

23
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,960
and we can scratch them together it's

24
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:57,440
very very friendly very nice

25
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,000
it's something that i don't think any of

26
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,559
you ever

27
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,960
seen and i need like developers and

28
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:05,438
artists and designers medical research

29
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:08,560
everything like does anyone here want to

30
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:12,000
help and become a contributor in my game

31
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:15,200
sure okay i saw

32
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,119
like a thing or two kind of

33
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,320
which is a bit frustrating so i'll have

34
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:21,520
to go back to my

35
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:23,600
original presentation i wanted to get to

36
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,839
call the game scratch that or but but

37
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:29,439
scratch that

38
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:31,360
um why do we want contributors

39
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:32,479
um this is actually a question when i

40
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,439
talk that i want uh

41
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:35,600
i said that i want to talk about

42
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:38,320
motivation people said like

43
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,679
why but is it really necessary that an

44
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:41,839
open source project

45
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,600
has more than one developer so i asked

46
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,200
myself like if a developer releases the

47
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:48,079
source code and no one reads it

48
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,439
is it still open source and you can

49
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:51,679
approach it from

50
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:53,600
one approach which is like ethics we

51
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,759
think that source should be open we want

52
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,759
people to be able to change our code

53
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:59,840
it doesn't matter if they do it or not

54
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:01,200
it's about your ownership of

55
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:04,240
applications that are

56
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,200
on your computer but i i prefer another

57
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,039
approach like

58
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,479
that open source is like love like you

59
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,679
can do it on your own but it's way

60
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,959
better together

61
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:15,040
um and this

62
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,080
made me think like of a thought

63
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,840
experiment

64
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,599
let's let's do that github tinder you

65
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:23,120
know people all the time they said like

66
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:24,560
oh i want to you know contribute to some

67
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:27,680
open source project i had it

68
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,319
so many times and then like there's

69
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,040
github

70
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:31,679
and you could like swipe left or swipe

71
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,760
right

72
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,080
and there's like my radius of interest i

73
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,560
can check what languages they know what

74
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,720
things

75
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:45,120
this sounds really really nice but um

76
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:47,359
i don't think it will work like

77
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,800
open source is not exactly like finding

78
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,400
a partner the alternative

79
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,000
not finding a partner is being alone

80
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,760
people come to this

81
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,440
like they really don't want to be alone

82
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,040
and the alternative for not being a

83
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,120
contributor is watching cat with us

84
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:03,359
which is kind of nice

85
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:06,159
so it's not really that um someone

86
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,560
um wants to work about your project it's

87
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:08,480
like

88
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,800
people are saying i want to contribute

89
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:14,399
to open source in general

90
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:17,840
and then this is kind of amorphic

91
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:20,319
it's not really anywhere near

92
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,200
actually being a contributor and for it

93
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:23,119
to change there

94
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,958
like you you you have to fight the cat

95
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:28,000
videos

96
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:29,680
so itches um eric s raymond in the

97
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,200
cathedral and the bazaar said that every

98
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,599
good work of software

99
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,720
starts by scratching a developer's

100
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:37,518
personal itch

101
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,560
now i want to expand on it a bit a bit

102
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:40,799
because like

103
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,239
even if you're a contributor if you if

104
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:43,599
you're not the first person who writes

105
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:47,360
the first line of code

106
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:49,760
it's still like a good work of software

107
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,040
that you're doing as part of a bigger

108
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:54,879
work of software

109
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:57,599
so it should still be the each like

110
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:59,040
the second contributor should have an

111
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:01,200
itch that is compatible

112
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,319
with the first contributor otherwise

113
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,518
they're going to watch

114
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:07,679
cat videos instead so

115
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:08,560
um we need these people these

116
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,640
contributors

117
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,879
with the compatible itches and the

118
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:17,120
skills to scratch them

119
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:19,599
and each

120
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,600
whatever

121
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:24,080
for this we somehow have to reach them

122
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,080
because

123
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,120
as there is no github thing that they

124
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:30,400
should come to the

125
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,919
project and you know see what you do

126
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,919
figure that they have the itch that is

127
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:37,198
compatible to you and start working

128
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:38,000
which brings me to trick number one make

129
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:41,199
something

130
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,440
that you already know it makes people

131
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:43,440
itch

132
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,040
how do you do that clones and

133
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,919
alternatives

134
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:52,320
if you think about all the talks today

135
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:55,520
that we had so far i actually checked it

136
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:57,360
and sorry i wasn't in the view for

137
00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:00,080
augmented reality one but all the ones

138
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:02,880
like we had a talk about godot

139
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,680
which is kind of an alternative for some

140
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:07,120
other

141
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:10,080
um unnamed game engines and

142
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,120
we have lots of games that are like open

143
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:14,800
x like open

144
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:17,039
a aoe or open ra we have receive

145
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,479
we have libreoffice it's like in general

146
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:21,919
open source projects

147
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:24,800
so like we see this uh a lot of times

148
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:26,400
we just saw like porting doom and before

149
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,320
that people were talking about ai for

150
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:31,039
starcraft would brutal

151
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:32,400
why why in open source we keep seeing

152
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:34,960
all these references

153
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,599
clones and alternatives to regular

154
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:39,520
software

155
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:42,800
and this is like because it gives you

156
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,198
a shared vision like the people had this

157
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,479
itch

158
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:49,680
in the first place i played a game

159
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:51,520
i had fun now when someone tells me what

160
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,880
his open source project is he can say

161
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:55,840
like i'm doing this

162
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,240
and i'm in my head this was fun i can do

163
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:59,119
that

164
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,000
and i will have fun or i want to expand

165
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,919
things like

166
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,600
the alternatives and people

167
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:07,359
have something in proprietary software

168
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,759
that they don't like they cannot change

169
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,520
it

170
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:12,639
so they're looking for an open source

171
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:15,919
alternative where they can

172
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:18,319
so in wikipedia i did like a very

173
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:20,000
new quick check and it seemed like more

174
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:22,639
than a third of the project on

175
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,560
the list of open source games were

176
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:24,800
remakes or clones and stuff like this

177
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,360
and

178
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:30,080
and this was not by passing every line

179
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:32,400
by just searching the word clone

180
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:34,000
and there's like a huge site of os games

181
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:37,440
game clones

182
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:41,120
in general it's a bit

183
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:42,400
you know impressive how much of the open

184
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:45,280
source work is is

185
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:47,359
not really original in in a way the

186
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,719
problem is that it limits your options

187
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,360
like i'm i'm

188
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,240
you know i'm a creative person i have my

189
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,599
own ideas

190
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,520
why do i have to make someone that

191
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:56,880
somebody else made i want to make my

192
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,919
projects and i want to find

193
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,719
contributors for it this makes sense and

194
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,719
and

195
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,800
obviously if you already started your

196
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:08,160
project it is a bit too late to decide

197
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,160
that it is remix something else

198
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:16,639
so this brings me to trick number two

199
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:17,120
actively it's your future contributors

200
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:19,360
like

201
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,160
if that each didn't exist in the first

202
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,919
place

203
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:27,280
let's try to each them release your game

204
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:29,440
have people play it gather an audience

205
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:31,440
and then when people play it their

206
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:33,599
itching

207
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:35,039
this this is very nice it's a bit the

208
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:37,199
same as we talked to before

209
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:38,639
about proprietary game that they like

210
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:42,400
created the each for us

211
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:42,400
this time we created it for us

212
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:48,000
if you're really really like brave just

213
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:48,800
leave small imperfections that will

214
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,560
annoy people

215
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:55,759
so they want to fix them um

216
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,759
i haven't done it yet

217
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,440
yet all the imperfections are not

218
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,879
deliberate

219
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:04,479
they're just like part part of the

220
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:05,919
process um it's very nice because

221
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:08,080
if people actually play the game and

222
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:08,719
people will have more patience trying

223
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:12,479
again

224
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:13,919
than reading what your new fancy project

225
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:17,039
is about because again

226
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:19,440
is more attractive than um just

227
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:21,680
you know a blog post about oh this is

228
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:24,639
going to be an amazing game

229
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:26,400
no one's seen anywhere um and you have a

230
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:26,960
lot of control over the direction of the

231
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,400
project

232
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:32,880
as opposed to alternatives and stuff

233
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,838
and especially because like you made the

234
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,000
first version

235
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:38,000
you you really control where this thing

236
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,479
is going

237
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,599
um it limits the scope like you cannot

238
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:44,159
do a

239
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:45,760
really big game like this because alone

240
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:49,360
you're not going to get to a playable

241
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:52,640
version that will each people just by um

242
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:54,720
you know just by yourself um and also it

243
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:56,640
can only be applied before development

244
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,959
so it didn't even help to what i wanted

245
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:01,279
to solve uh which is a problem

246
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:02,479
we're still only talking about things

247
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:06,959
that you can do

248
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:09,680
before you start your project okay so

249
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:11,518
let's see um what about projects that

250
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:14,239
already exist

251
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:15,120
uh yeah be attractive i know that we

252
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,399
talked about

253
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:22,560
dating and swiping and

254
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:24,399
wanting like that people notice us so

255
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:26,160
in this case let's say i have a project

256
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:30,000
any kind of project

257
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:33,279
show don't tell i you it's much better

258
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:36,480
to put screenshots than text

259
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:39,680
it's much better to to do

260
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:41,680
to give examples be nice

261
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:43,279
i know this sounds very weird but there

262
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:45,040
are communities um

263
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:46,720
that the developers are not very nice

264
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,599
and it doesn't seem like a very friendly

265
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,640
place to be

266
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:52,240
um some of them managed to you know

267
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,160
power through it because many people

268
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,080
really really really need um

269
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,439
to work with them and they're like a

270
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:00,800
monopoly like linux

271
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:03,200
but when you are a small contributor and

272
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:05,279
this is the way to be attractive then be

273
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:07,440
nice

274
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:08,560
and make scratching as effortless as

275
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,640
possible let's say

276
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:13,439
someone is insane and they want to

277
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:15,199
contribute to your project

278
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,880
there's a really nice metric that the

279
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,120
adam kariv

280
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,920
did uh which is the time of onboarding

281
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,720
finding and

282
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:24,880
fixing an issue end to end like if you

283
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:28,160
have a really really weird

284
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:31,680
uh framework and you need like to

285
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:32,079
start up vms and make dependencies and i

286
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,800
don't know

287
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:35,839
what people will just not have enough

288
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,560
good will

289
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:40,399
to remain until that works they just

290
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:42,160
want to fix something small

291
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:44,399
no one will ever come to your project

292
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,920
okay nope no one but usually people

293
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:47,600
won't come to a project wanting to

294
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,640
change it end to end they will want to

295
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,680
fix something small

296
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,720
make it easy for them to do this this is

297
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:55,279
also about like

298
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:57,440
language if you thought like oh my god i

299
00:10:55,279 --> 00:11:00,079
have an amazing project let's do it in

300
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:02,480
haskell or anything like i want to learn

301
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:04,640
this fancy new language

302
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,160
don't do that pick a language that

303
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:09,279
people know that people

304
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:11,920
people can uh work with like check

305
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:12,560
goodall and basically everything it was

306
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:15,279
said today

307
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:16,719
where in languages that people use open

308
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:18,640
rougher instances in c

309
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:20,560
sharp and while it's not our favorite

310
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,959
language many people know it and they

311
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:24,319
get

312
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:24,319
loads of contributors

313
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:28,079
no wait this still doesn't help i told

314
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,760
you what languages to pick and

315
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:31,359
everything so you still have to think

316
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:34,800
about all these things

317
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:36,640
before you start your project um so so

318
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,519
really i think this is the moral here if

319
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:40,160
you pick the wrong

320
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:42,160
project nothing will help you like you

321
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:45,839
can

322
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:49,519
try you can walk with what you have

323
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:50,079
but really really when it boils down to

324
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:53,120
it

325
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:55,199
it's a lot of choices that you make in

326
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,720
what the project is based on where you

327
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,560
where you're going and how you are

328
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,560
attractive to other people

329
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,920
this is what's going to make or break

330
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:05,279
whether people

331
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:08,560
itch about your project or not

332
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:11,680
and wrong project is not about the game

333
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:12,239
your game idea can be amazing and it can

334
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:17,359
be like

335
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:17,360
really really good but it's just

336
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:24,880
an unattractive project it's you cannot

337
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:25,519
convey to anyone you talk to that it is

338
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,399
attractive

339
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:30,160
in the attention span they have before

340
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:34,240
they switch to youtube and the

341
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:34,240
cat videos um

342
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:38,000
so really this brings me to my last

343
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:41,120
trick um

344
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,480
the best way and the only real way to

345
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,240
double your contributors

346
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:46,560
is find some project that has one

347
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,760
contributor and join it and then it has

348
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:52,000
two contributors

349
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:55,279
and you've doubled the contributors um

350
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,279
and it's not a bad idea because

351
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:58,560
there are really really many of this

352
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:01,839
project around there

353
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:05,359
and one of them can be quite interesting

354
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:07,279
and by definition um it's it's going to

355
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:10,560
be an attractive project

356
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:11,680
um because you picked it so you're

357
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:14,800
attracted to it

358
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:15,439
and like relationships you just find

359
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,079
something

360
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:19,839
that you makes you happy it doesn't have

361
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:22,160
to be like the fantasy that you hold

362
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:24,000
about like the perfect game

363
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:25,279
and it doesn't have to be popular or

364
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,399
anything you just

365
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:28,399
need to enjoy it yourself

366
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:33,200
so the really cool thing about trick

367
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:34,079
zero you can always do it even if you

368
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:37,920
started the project

369
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:39,680
if even if the project isn't started yet

370
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,760
and it teaches you an important life

371
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:44,239
lesson which is just a bonus

372
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:45,839
um and it spreads the love of course

373
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,519
because open source is love and we want

374
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:50,079
to do it together

375
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:52,160
i'm a lot quite biased i must say

376
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:54,880
because i've joined an existing

377
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:56,160
project and i haven't worked on any of

378
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:58,160
my own

379
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,600
very crazy ideas for the future that i

380
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,319
really really want to start and i would

381
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,360
be happy

382
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:07,680
to tell you all about them but just like

383
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:10,000
i think that i spent my time quite well

384
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,800
and the project that i work on and i

385
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,800
didn't even

386
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,920
talk about it it's called spring it's an

387
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,839
rts engine

388
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:18,639
and it started as a remake of total

389
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:20,959
annihilation back in the day in 2005.

390
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:22,720
um i've been a player before becoming a

391
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:24,880
contributor if you see like these are

392
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:28,720
the exact tricks like this trick zero

393
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:32,240
this is trick one this is trick um

394
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:35,839
which one of those two um and and

395
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:38,560
when i think of how i became i really

396
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:40,000
went through all these processes that i

397
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:43,199
was talking about

398
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:45,120
um so you might say

399
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:46,719
wait this is just like you're trying to

400
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:49,199
stifle my creativity

401
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,639
you're painting a very bleak picture of

402
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:53,279
how open source is just

403
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:54,560
uncreative and and cannot compete in

404
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:57,600
this manner with

405
00:14:54,560 --> 00:15:01,439
um uh with proprietary software

406
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:03,920
so so maybe i am i do think that we are

407
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,519
in some ways disadvantaged and if you do

408
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:07,519
really want contributors

409
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:09,519
you have to walk with what you have

410
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:10,000
rather than hope for things that are

411
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:14,399
better

412
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:17,279
i'm sorry if i disappointed here um

413
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:17,279
what is going on

414
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:22,560
oh yes i have finished actually really

415
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:25,440
fast

416
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:26,239
nice i thought i thought um no it's just

417
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:29,839
really really fast

418
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,839
went fast anyway so questions

419
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:40,560
um

420
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:41,839
yes because it involves first the

421
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:45,199
religion of the game

422
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:47,759
which is already like a hello journey

423
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:48,639
and the second one which is even more

424
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:51,759
like

425
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:53,680
hard is to attract the players which is

426
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:55,040
for me personally it's even harder than

427
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,239
to release the game

428
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:58,319
because really in the game in the end

429
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:00,079
adjusted development it's a lot of time

430
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:02,320
but you can do this on your own

431
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:03,439
but together an audience you really have

432
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,120
to work

433
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:08,079
i don't know why it's harder than on

434
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:11,600
development so how do you actually

435
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:13,920
try this trick yes so the question was

436
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,680
um how you can you do this when even

437
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,880
releasing your game is really really

438
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:20,160
hard on your own

439
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:20,639
and um then once even once you released

440
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,319
it

441
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:24,639
getting to players and getting them to

442
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:27,759
play a game is going to be

443
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:31,120
quite hard so i think

444
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:34,000
that in general attracting

445
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:35,519
players will be simpler than attracting

446
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,880
contributors

447
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:41,279
um it's it's just like look at

448
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:42,959
every community they usually have more

449
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:43,439
players than contributors unless they're

450
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:45,359
like

451
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:47,360
entirely dead and they're not even

452
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,959
trying to find players or i don't know

453
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,480
what like

454
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:52,638
it's in in most communities or

455
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:54,480
successful communities that i've seen

456
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:56,000
and the majority of people are the

457
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:58,639
players so

458
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,079
it's kind of i understand that it is

459
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:03,600
hard to find less

460
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:06,240
but this is like the lesser

461
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,839
problem that you get here and now about

462
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,079
releasing your game you are right this

463
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:11,039
is

464
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:12,000
kind of the problem and and it's just

465
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:16,240
like

466
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:18,720
if you pick uh and you plan your scope

467
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:19,439
accordingly you can do a better that is

468
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:22,160
fun

469
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:22,720
and like shows promise it doesn't have

470
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:26,160
to be

471
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:29,200
100 playable but it should show

472
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:31,280
uh and give this you know itching that

473
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:33,520
somebody wants to like i want to see

474
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:35,760
how how will how it will be when it is

475
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,760
done

476
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,960
okay
