1
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:07,359
welcome gabrielle who's going to talk

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:10,719
about

3
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:10,720
how to make things accessible

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:18,880
okay what is the accessibility

5
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:31,599
doctor okay web accessibility

6
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:36,559
means that websites software and

7
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:36,559
technology are has to be designed for

8
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,960
for also for the people with disability

9
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:45,360
not only physical but

10
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:47,680
also social and economic

11
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,559
okay first actor in the web

12
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,559
accessibility

13
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:56,160
of the accessibility is the screen

14
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:59,520
reader leader

15
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:02,879
a set of assistive technologies

16
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:06,159
that that can help people uh

17
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:09,600
visually impaired illiterated or with

18
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:12,560
learning disabilities okay

19
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,399
the what worldwide web consortium has

20
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:18,000
worked on accessibility with

21
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:21,439
with uh and that's created

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,920
these two these two things wa

23
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:24,880
is a web achievability initiative is a

24
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,600
team that

25
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:29,199
develops standard and support material

26
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,439
for developers

27
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,600
for implement accessibility in their

28
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:36,079
code bases

29
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,960
first work of the web accessibility

30
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:40,479
initiative

31
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:44,798
was the area attribute

32
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:47,600
a set of html attribute

33
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:48,640
that defines a way to make uh web

34
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,600
content

35
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:53,840
more readable from the screen reader

36
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:56,798
okay

37
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,439
attributes are there are divided in

38
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,560
roles

39
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:04,079
properties and states

40
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:08,239
okay wcg are a set of

41
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:11,679
gridline for making the web content

42
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:11,679
more accessible okay

43
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:19,040
wcg are divided in four layers

44
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:21,520
in there are the principle for every

45
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:23,599
principle there are some guidelines

46
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,200
and for every guideline there are the

47
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:29,280
success criteria and the

48
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:32,079
the sufficient and advisory techniques

49
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,959
okay there this is the there are the

50
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,840
four uh

51
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:37,280
principle of our content accessibility

52
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:40,400
guidelines

53
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:43,840
the principles are perceivable operable

54
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:48,000
understandable and robust let's see

55
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:51,599
the guideline for each other forever

56
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:55,840
okay for the perceivable principle

57
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:58,238
uh wcg defines a white line for

58
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,599
alternative for non-text content

59
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:04,159
alternative for

60
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:06,799
live streaming audio video for the

61
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:07,760
content orientation and the independence

62
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:11,680
of uh

63
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:15,519
from the platform and the

64
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:18,879
guidelines about colors audio control

65
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:22,879
contrast and the sides

66
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:26,798
okay for the operable principle

67
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:29,760
there are a specification about

68
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:29,760
cable shortcuts

69
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:39,360
timing time and content

70
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:44,840
for animation and color flashes

71
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:46,720
for navigability and for the input

72
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:50,560
modalities

73
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:54,640
this is simple the understandable

74
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:58,640
principle has only three guidelines

75
00:03:54,640 --> 00:04:01,839
about readability predictability and the

76
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,839
input assistance

77
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:05,599
for the robust principle is the one

78
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,959
one-way line

79
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:08,959
about the compatibility

80
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:16,320
okay let's see some

81
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:19,918
tricks for uh for a factor

82
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:22,400
for quickly refactor output basis

83
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:23,120
first rule do you know the difference

84
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,159
between the

85
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:29,360
this two two stroke structure

86
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:33,360
okay first rule is use semantic tags in

87
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:37,680
html simple

88
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:43,280
other tricks could be alternative

89
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:45,600
for alternative text for images

90
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:48,000
alternative text for audio and video

91
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,000
content

92
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:56,160
and cable navigation with the role and

93
00:04:51,919 --> 00:05:00,639
tab index attribute

94
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:02,639
okay if you want to to improve your

95
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:04,479
accessibility accessibility on your

96
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:08,000
website you can use

97
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:11,280
this tool that i show you

98
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:15,120
this is a platformer

99
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:19,198
of w3c that compiles for you

100
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:21,840
accessibility reports and send

101
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:21,840
via email

102
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:30,400
okay this is a checklist

103
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:33,280
filterable for uh

104
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,320
without the task for uh forever a good

105
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:38,880
adjustable

106
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:42,960
web application

107
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:46,240
this is a a native tool for uh

108
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:48,560
for check the contrast of the of the

109
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,560
page

110
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:56,719
this is another tool but online

111
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:57,520
where where you put the your foreground

112
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:01,280
color

113
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:04,400
your application background color and

114
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:08,960
if and for you every better contrast

115
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,960
than yours with the similar color

116
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:22,720
dynamapper is another cloud service for

117
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:22,719
web accessibility report but is play

118
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:30,080
web is a free alternative

119
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:32,639
to dino mapper let's see wave is a very

120
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,639
good tool

121
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:39,359
fosdem.org it shows a

122
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:40,319
preview of the website with the warnings

123
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,520
uh

124
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:46,960
where uh where are things uh

125
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:50,639
with problems so

126
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:54,560
for the website as a bit a bit

127
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:59,199
contrast color contrast problem

128
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:59,199
okay and

129
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:06,560
webinte is another tool for uh

130
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,520
check the best practice on your

131
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:12,080
application

132
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:12,080
and also as the accessibility section

133
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:17,680
webbing is also available as a web

134
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:21,280
extension

you know

138
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:34,800
okay perfecto

139
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:34,800
and it compiles

140
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:41,039
report about accessibility

141
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,799
there are no issues it's a black page

142
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:47,440
with an image

143
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:47,440
there are no issues here okay

144
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:51,199
you for check your accessibility you can

145
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:54,319
use

146
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:56,800
the dev tools of your browser

147
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:58,879
uh the tools are in for accessibility

148
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:01,919
are included in firefox

149
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:04,319
and are available as an extension for

150
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:04,318
chrome

151
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:12,160
okay this is a github collection

152
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:17,120
that collects every resource about

153
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:17,120
web accessibility available on github

154
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:27,840
okay i finished

155
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:32,719
that was nice thank you for catching up

156
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:35,360
um do you have questions we have time

157
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:35,360
for questions

158
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:41,839
questions

159
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:52,839
he wants the first slide or the second

160
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:55,839
fly and then you answer questions about

161
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:55,839
that

162
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,800
can you explain what rename rule value

163
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:12,480
is name rule

164
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:16,240
for uh the input control and for the

165
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:20,240
html elements okay

166
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:22,880
aria rule and input name

167
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:25,600
okay it's not clear yeah input name we

168
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,600
put value

169
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:40,000
okay other questions

170
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:42,319
hi um how how much of these uh

171
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,920
like suggestions would be applicable to

172
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:47,680
a desktop application say

173
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:50,000
written in qt would be a good start or

174
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,880
do you have other developer desktop

175
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,320
application

176
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:57,839
yes i'm not a desktop

177
00:09:54,320 --> 00:10:01,839
application developer so but you can

178
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:05,760
you can use the same guideline

179
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:08,000
adapted but wchig

180
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:10,160
could be the principle and the

181
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:19,839
guidelines could be used also

182
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:19,839
for desktop application

183
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,279
hi uh thank you for your talk uh my

184
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,560
question will be like you know with

185
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:27,519
developing um

186
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:28,000
i'm working on a web-based application

187
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:31,120
and

188
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,440
uh what would be your suggestion to have

189
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,560
an

190
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:36,959
automated uh you know

191
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:39,040
way of checking accessibility when

192
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:42,079
developing a web-based application

193
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,079
i know there are solutions

194
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:47,440
at the moment for react components

195
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,720
but you know just as a web application

196
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:51,360
i'm pretty sure there are some

197
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,320
good uh tools for that thank you good

198
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,680
question

199
00:10:52,320 --> 00:11:01,600
i don't know if there are automatic

200
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:03,839
tester but i use an eslint plugin

201
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,839
that

202
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:12,880
expressively for accessibility

203
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:15,040
and i use that and so i i can build

204
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:19,200
application

205
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:22,640
accessible accessible application in

206
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,640
at build time okay

207
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:34,079
um accessibility-wise what framework uh

208
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:34,640
from i don't know either to like react

209
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:37,839
angular

210
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:39,120
or uh on the css side which frameworks

211
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:41,440
to

212
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,160
do you advise and accessibility-wise

213
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:45,440
which one

214
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:48,719
are kind of are more aware is

215
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:51,920
not real not related to any framework

216
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:53,680
you can use the one you want no no sure

217
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:56,880
sure but sometimes a lot of frameworks

218
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:59,680
they provide a lot of widgets and

219
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:00,560
components that they they have

220
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,239
accessibility

221
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,680
issues if i get a component with a lot

222
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:07,120
of buttons i mean

223
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:08,880
yeah so do you think in the the scope of

224
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,240
frameworks which one is the one that is

225
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:13,200
more accessibility aware

226
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:15,760
is not the community okay um i don't

227
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:20,000
know but i use a reactor

228
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:22,720
for work and it does a very good

229
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
it has no issues with accessibility i

230
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:28,480
use react and

231
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,480
yes linked with the accessibility plugin

232
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,839
could you give us an example of social

233
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:39,839
and economic

234
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:39,839
disabilities

235
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:48,240
people illiterated

236
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:51,439
so they can't read

237
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:53,600
on their career test text and can use

238
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:56,720
the screen reader for uh

239
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:59,519
for understand the content

240
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:01,200
i'm going to step in have a talk on

241
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:02,240
accessibility later on but more on the

242
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,399
social part

243
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,279
and i would add that the criteria for

244
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:07,600
this is that

245
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:08,320
in many countries internet is extremely

246
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,920
expensive

247
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,959
like for 35 years you get around max one

248
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:15,760
gigabyte

249
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:16,638
and many will not be able to load your

250
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,959
page

251
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:20,720
there is a really good talk by a friend

252
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:23,119
of mine that i recommend

253
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,880
stefan he's literally comparing the

254
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,680
website how much they load and how much

255
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,880
memory they will

256
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:30,719
eat out of your internet connection

257
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:32,639
besides the price money-wise the

258
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,440
accessibility to a good connection is

259
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:36,320
also

260
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:38,000
limited in many countries these two like

261
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:40,320
exactly how much internet cost

262
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,680
outside we are like in europe i would

263
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,320
say outside europe and

264
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:46,160
maybe even usa even if in usa you get

265
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,680
max 10 gigabytes for 35

266
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:49,519
dollars which will is extremely

267
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:52,399
expensive for what

268
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:53,600
we paid here and again accessibility to

269
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:54,959
well access to

270
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,880
a good connection where you can low

271
00:13:54,959 --> 00:14:02,719
staff not 2g or

272
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:05,600
even less than that

273
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,600
any other questions

274
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:12,560
is there any way to measure if somebody

275
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:16,480
is trying to

276
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:18,638
use let's say a screen reader on my site

277
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,600
for for me as a developer to see if

278
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:23,760
that's actually like

279
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,760
if somebody is trying to do that okay

280
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:28,719
i don't know if there is a way but you

281
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:31,839
have to

282
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,839
to implement accessibility

283
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:39,920
before uh thinking of screen reader

284
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,880
you have to implement an accessible code

285
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,959
base and

286
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:45,360
you don't have problems with the screen

287
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:45,359
reader

288
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,279
more questions

289
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:59,839
no so thank you gabrielle

290
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:05,650
[Applause]

291
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,760
you
