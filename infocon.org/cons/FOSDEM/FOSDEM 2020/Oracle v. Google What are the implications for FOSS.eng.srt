1
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:09,200
today

2
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:10,320
uh that meant and because we only have

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,479
one day

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,320
for our dev room that meant that we only

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,240
had a couple of

6
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,440
slots available for regular talks so it

7
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:20,400
was very

8
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:21,279
difficult to have a regular talk uh this

9
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,919
time

10
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:24,720
in our dev room uh one of the talks that

11
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,760
we did accept

12
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:30,160
is the upcoming one

13
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,199
which is on a topic that i think that

14
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,040
many many of us

15
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:35,520
are very concerned about and is very

16
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:39,200
important for our community

17
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,559
i'm really excited to introduce van

18
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:44,079
lindberg who's going to give us an

19
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:47,199
update on this very important topic

20
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:48,640
oh thank you i am

21
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,879
i'm glad to be here today can you all

22
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:54,399
hear me perfect

23
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:58,320
so i want to uh so

24
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:59,680
let's see how do i move to the next one

25
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,719
don't shout because if we can't throw

26
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,680
you on the mic then it's not the

27
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,879
recording

28
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:06,400
gotcha um so what we're going to be

29
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,000
talking about today is i'm going to give

30
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:11,439
you as quickly as possible

31
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,799
an overview of who is arguing what or

32
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:13,839
what we think that they're going to be

33
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:15,840
arguing

34
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,840
sort of the overview of what's what's

35
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,520
going on in the case who's arguing what

36
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,840
uh the various positions that are being

37
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,679
advanced and then i'd like to just tie

38
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,240
up with a few thoughts about how this

39
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,520
might

40
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,479
affect uh affect free and open source

41
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:31,439
software

42
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:31,840
so first thing is i'm going to assume

43
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:34,880
that

44
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:38,640
um this is where we are

45
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:41,280
right now all the argument all the

46
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,159
google has filed its brief uh google has

47
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,079
filed this brief

48
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:47,439
all the all the amicus briefs

49
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:49,919
they're called friends of the court

50
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:53,119
briefs either in favor of or

51
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,720
in favor of google or in support of

52
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:57,200
neither party have been filed

53
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,960
coming up very soon we're going to have

54
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:02,960
oracle's brief and a week later

55
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:04,798
the briefs in favoring oracle

56
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,559
things have been set for arguments on

57
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:08,560
may on march

58
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,679
24th and then probably by june we'll

59
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,160
have a decision

60
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:13,680
no matter what happens this is probably

61
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:16,879
going to affect

62
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:19,120
the way all of our free software

63
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:20,399
free and open source software licenses

64
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,440
are interpreted

65
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:25,200
so a couple key concepts

66
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,480
i'm assuming that most people are going

67
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,519
to be familiar with

68
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:32,000
the the ideas of fair use of

69
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,560
of copyright ability i've highlighted up

70
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,680
here

71
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:38,720
sort of the three key two key concepts

72
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:40,720
and one key case that is really going to

73
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:43,040
is really going to form the basis for

74
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,160
what a lot of people are talking about

75
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,720
this first is this idea of

76
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:50,400
copyrightability uh

77
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:52,879
copyright covers creative expression

78
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,720
however the same copyright statute says

79
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:56,959
that it doesn't cover

80
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,400
ideas systems methods of operation

81
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,000
functional things like that

82
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,519
so the big question is are the

83
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,680
declarations and the

84
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:05,040
the structure sequence and organization

85
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,599
the sso of those

86
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,319
is that functional is that is that

87
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:09,760
creative

88
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:11,359
how does that tie into the copyright

89
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:15,359
statute the second idea

90
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:17,519
is fair fair use

91
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,959
sometimes even things that are would

92
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,440
otherwise be

93
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:24,000
infringing are allowed because it

94
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:26,480
advances a larger societal purpose

95
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,519
in the case of uh oracle v google we're

96
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,040
talking a lot about

97
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:32,640
interoperability we're talking about

98
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:36,000
competition but we're also talking about

99
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:40,079
the in the broader purpose of incenting

100
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,519
people to to try and create new works

101
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,560
which is the purpose of copyright

102
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:45,599
overall

103
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:48,480
fair use is a balancing act between the

104
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:50,399
rights of other people to use things

105
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,599
in ways that you may not necessarily

106
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,920
agree with if it

107
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:55,040
serves a more a broader more important

108
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,040
societal purpose

109
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,640
than the base purpose of copyright which

110
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,319
is to encourage more works

111
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:02,480
finally i'm going to be talking about a

112
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:03,679
lot about a case called baker v selden

113
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:07,200
this is a case from

114
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:09,040
the late 1800s where a guy had a book

115
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,319
where he described how a bunch of things

116
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:13,040
work in these some forms

117
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:14,159
in it to describe his accounting his

118
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,159
accounting system

119
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:17,680
another guy published a different book

120
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,280
he used those same forms

121
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,239
got sued for copyright infringement went

122
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,119
all the way up to the supreme court

123
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:22,960
supreme court said

124
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,240
you have a copyright in the book but

125
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,560
your copyright does not

126
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,919
extend to those forms if you wanted if

127
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,680
you wanted to protect those forms you

128
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:32,240
needed to get a patent

129
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,840
uh this was sort of the first time the

130
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,320
supreme court embraced this

131
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:38,479
idea expression distinction and it went

132
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:41,680
on to uh

133
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:44,479
it went on to form the basis a lot of

134
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:46,080
a lot of copyright jurisprudence today

135
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:48,240
so

136
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,120
i want to talk for a moment about the

137
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,160
framing

138
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:53,840
that both google and oracle are

139
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:57,440
with which they're they're approaching

140
00:04:53,840 --> 00:05:01,119
this now

141
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:03,600
google some basic facts google took

142
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,520
the entirety the work when we're talking

143
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,160
about it what's the work it is the java

144
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:10,479
2

145
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:13,199
it's java 2 se it is

146
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:14,479
they took the entirety of this work and

147
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:17,600
particularly they took

148
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:18,560
the declarations that formed the that

149
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,039
formed the api

150
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,800
they took 37 of them that they said hey

151
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:25,280
these are going to be relevant for

152
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,720
the mobile phone context they took the

153
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:29,198
declarations from that

154
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,840
and copied those and then either wrote

155
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:33,039
or used

156
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:35,039
apache harmony to to

157
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:36,400
put in the implementing code those

158
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:39,440
declarations and then

159
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,960
the organization of them into

160
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,440
the class structure is what we're

161
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:45,440
talking about

162
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,919
google's framing is that these

163
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:51,199
declarations are entirely functional

164
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:52,639
this is really a system of operation

165
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:54,400
we really shouldn't be talking about

166
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:57,039
copyright at all

167
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,679
and their main argument that they're

168
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:01,919
really

169
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:05,039
focusing on is this idea of merger after

170
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:08,318
google after oracle had created these

171
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:10,719
java packages there was only one way

172
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:12,960
for people to access the functionality

173
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:15,039
and that was by using the specific name

174
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,479
and the specific organization that that

175
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:19,039
oracle had prescribed

176
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:20,080
therefore this this copyright concept

177
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:21,759
called merger says

178
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:25,198
there's really only one way to do it so

179
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:27,360
you can't tie that thing up by copyright

180
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:30,319
they've also said it doesn't matter that

181
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:33,680
we copied 11 000 of these

182
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:35,360
if you can copy one fact or one

183
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,759
piece of functionality you can copy a

184
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:41,759
thousand it doesn't matter

185
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:44,720
uh now looking so that is broadly

186
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:45,600
google's framing goo in this context

187
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,639
google is

188
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:50,240
arguing a couple things on copyright the

189
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:52,319
first thing is that they are really

190
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,360
going all in on the merger doctrine and

191
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:56,479
they said

192
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:58,880
of course you can are you can

193
00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:00,400
decide that this whole thing is a system

194
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:03,440
of operation

195
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:05,520
but in their in their case they but

196
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,560
in their brief they say but if you would

197
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,919
like to

198
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:12,000
to decide this on a narrower basis and

199
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:13,599
that is like catnip to the supreme court

200
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,039
they always like narrower bases for

201
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:18,479
their decisions

202
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:20,240
uh you can say this was this is really

203
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:22,159
controlled by the merger doctrine there

204
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,039
was really only one way to do this and

205
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,360
so therefore

206
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:26,479
the specific parts of the work that we

207
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,599
copied

208
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:31,280
were excluded from copyright and it was

209
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:33,599
okay

210
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,559
um the other thing is that they're

211
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:37,520
saying that this

212
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,160
really court is a great policy this is

213
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,799
something that

214
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,840
is enabling people to create new works

215
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,960
this is something that

216
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:47,679
is broadly accepted in the industry

217
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:50,239
and it is furthering the function of

218
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,240
copyright

219
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,160
google doesn't stop there because

220
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:54,639
they've actually the supreme court is

221
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,120
actually

222
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:58,560
going on two questions they said we are

223
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,280
going to review both the copyright

224
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:03,599
ability and whether this was fair use

225
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:05,520
and so google's position on fair use is

226
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:08,080
that

227
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:09,120
you know what the jury this really was a

228
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,199
question for the jury

229
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,319
which is actually a really good point

230
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:15,039
and the jury said

231
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:15,919
this is fair use the jury had a good

232
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:18,318
reason they heard

233
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:19,280
hundreds of hours of testimony they

234
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:21,039
could

235
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,318
they could reasonably decide that this

236
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:23,840
was fair use

237
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:26,479
and so there was really no reason to

238
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:28,638
overturn what the jury said

239
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:30,400
case closed so even if you disagree with

240
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:32,159
us on copyright ability

241
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:34,718
the jury could have decided this

242
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:38,479
completely reasonably

243
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:41,440
on the other hand oracle's framing

244
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:42,159
is a is a little bit different oracle's

245
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,480
saying

246
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:45,600
you know what this is like a literary

247
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,920
work in fact

248
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,600
software itself is protected as a

249
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:52,000
literary work

250
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,800
and so when we think about types of

251
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,800
works

252
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,479
we talk about whether there's a thin

253
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,920
copyright or whether it's a broad or a

254
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,160
strong copyright

255
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:01,439
and the broadest strongest copyright are

256
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,240
for the things that show the most

257
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,040
creativity

258
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:06,160
and court this was hard this was

259
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,160
creative

260
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,600
and so we should have as broad a

261
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:12,079
copyright as possible

262
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,680
and all those things that google copied

263
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:17,680
that was essentially like

264
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:19,439
copying all of the heading chapter head

265
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:22,079
chapter titles and headings and

266
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:25,200
subheadings of a very long and complex

267
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:27,920
book and you can't really just

268
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,040
copy part of that or copy the heart of

269
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:32,240
something

270
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:33,040
and and say well we didn't copy all of

271
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:36,080
it

272
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:38,319
the fact is there was creativity in the

273
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,360
organization of this and it was it was

274
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:44,560
expressive

275
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:44,560
in the way that we put it together um

276
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:50,959
with regard to with regard to

277
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:52,560
fair use they're also talking a lot

278
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:55,359
about the uh

279
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,079
this idea of the creativity and the work

280
00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:00,399
that they put

281
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:00,399
into it it is uh

282
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:04,640
one of the core use core elements of

283
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:07,440
fair use is that it shouldn't

284
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:08,959
override and shouldn't displace the

285
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:12,000
commercial

286
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:14,319
prospects of the original author uh

287
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
it shouldn't displace the original work

288
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,839
uh and so they're saying

289
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,760
what we did is we created essentially a

290
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:21,680
very popular literary work we had

291
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:24,480
millions and millions of fans

292
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:26,319
and they decided that this was something

293
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,880
that they wanted to copy

294
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,600
uh google's use was overwhelming

295
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,439
commercial

296
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,440
overwhelmingly commercial and it was

297
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,279
used for the exact same purpose

298
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:38,240
it doesn't matter that you changed the

299
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:40,640
context if you read a book

300
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:43,600
if you read a book here and you read a

301
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:45,920
book on stage it's still the same book

302
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,120
they and it was still the exact same

303
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:50,399
content so that is

304
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:54,160
oracle's overall framing

305
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:56,720
um i also want to uh

306
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:57,760
note this this this was their briefing

307
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,200
off position

308
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:01,120
one note about all these things about

309
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,800
oracle as i noted they haven't actually

310
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,000
filed their brief with the supreme court

311
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,479
yet so what i would

312
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,360
did is i went back and i pulled all the

313
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,440
briefs

314
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,480
from oracle at all the different stages

315
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,640
of the case

316
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,480
and i also polled all of the people who

317
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:17,519
filed in support of oracle

318
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,399
at earlier stages in the case so all the

319
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:20,720
things that i'm say

320
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:22,560
that that i'm quoting are things that

321
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,320
were said either by oracle or in support

322
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:26,399
of oracle at an earlier stage

323
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,320
that i think are likely to come up when

324
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:30,240
we see their their full arguments in a

325
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:33,760
week or two

326
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:35,200
uh but this idea the bolded portion

327
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,880
google's copying was equivalent of

328
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,160
taking the most recognizable parts of a

329
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,760
popular short story

330
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,439
turning them into a blockbuster movie

331
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,000
without the offers permission something

332
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:46,240
the supreme

333
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,240
court deemed a classic unfair use

334
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:51,839
so let's think about this for a moment

335
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:54,319
what do we know

336
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:55,440
as i mentioned the supreme court granted

337
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,639
certiorari on

338
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:59,920
both questions now for those who are not

339
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:02,160
legal geeks

340
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:05,439
and i realize that may be only half of

341
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,439
you in this audience but

342
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,079
so when someone goes up to the supreme

343
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:12,079
court they

344
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:13,760
have what they call questions presented

345
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:15,439
what are the things that we want you to

346
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:18,160
decide supreme court

347
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:19,120
and they usually put up one or two and

348
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,360
the supreme court

349
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,720
doesn't have to take the case at all or

350
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,480
if it takes the case

351
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,240
it can specify we're only going to talk

352
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,680
about question one or we're only going

353
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,600
to talk about question two

354
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,120
now procedurally oracle be google is

355
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,200
very interesting because it came up to

356
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,880
the supreme court once before

357
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:37,200
the supreme court thought about taking

358
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:38,399
it and they said on copyrightability and

359
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,800
they said

360
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:42,079
nah we'll send we're not going to take

361
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,760
it now

362
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:45,680
it went down they had the trial on fair

363
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:48,399
use it came up again

364
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:49,839
and the supreme court said okay we'll

365
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:52,959
look at it this time

366
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:54,720
they decided to accept on both the

367
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:56,719
original question of copyright ability

368
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,399
as well as the second question on fair

369
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:01,519
use

370
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:03,600
so if the court takes a

371
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:05,360
grant certiorari and particularly on a

372
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,600
particular question that means at least

373
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:09,760
four of the nine justices think that

374
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:12,480
there is an important

375
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:14,160
uh principle that needs to be addressed

376
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,959
uh so you've got at least four people

377
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,279
who say

378
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:18,479
this both the copyright ability and the

379
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:22,079
fair use questions

380
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:22,079
are worthy of being looked at

381
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:27,920
i also want to look at sort of their

382
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,639
framing

383
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:32,160
google's argument on merger it maps

384
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:33,200
really well to the copyright statute

385
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,880
you've got a lot of people on the

386
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:37,519
supreme court a lot of the justices

387
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,880
who very much like to be grounded in the

388
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:42,480
text of the statute

389
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:45,279
and 17 usc 102b talks about

390
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:47,600
hey in no way does copyright extend to

391
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:51,519
any idea system

392
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:54,160
system function method of operation etc

393
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:56,560
it's easy to say see how software can

394
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:59,199
fit into that

395
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:00,319
the issue though is that they're putting

396
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:02,719
all their eggs

397
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:05,279
in this merger basket and oracle's

398
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,959
argument on merger is very subtle

399
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:09,519
but i think it's powerful oracle's

400
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:12,638
argument on a merger is that

401
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:14,639
for merger to apply it has to apply

402
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:16,720
what's called exante beforehand there

403
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:20,639
only has to be a couple ways to express

404
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:23,120
this in the first place

405
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:24,320
they've said you know what actually

406
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:27,279
oracle had

407
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,760
thousands of ways to express this and

408
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:30,399
really

409
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:31,199
there was there were constraints only

410
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:33,839
because

411
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:34,479
google wanted to tap into oracle's

412
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:36,320
market

413
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,160
that's a powerful mark that's a powerful

414
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:40,079
argument that in some cases

415
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,920
various a lot of these things haven't

416
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:42,560
been litigated but various people have

417
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,880
said

418
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:48,000
that is one of the times when merger

419
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:48,000
doesn't necessarily apply

420
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:54,079
the also however various amiki have made

421
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:57,279
arguments that reach the same conclusion

422
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:59,439
via other other routes so it's not

423
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:00,720
necessarily a hundred percent on just

424
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,399
the oracle v google

425
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,560
main arguments the other thing that i

426
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:07,839
want to point out is that

427
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:08,880
this idea in the second case there was a

428
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:11,360
jury verdict

429
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:12,399
for fair use that was overturned and

430
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,480
ruled as

431
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:16,880
no possible jury could have ever come to

432
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:20,320
that conclusion by the federal circuit

433
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:23,360
that thing is incredibly rare

434
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:25,600
and arguably fairly improper

435
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:27,279
i think that that is the wild card

436
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:29,680
that's really going to

437
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:30,720
that is going to be the hardest thing to

438
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:33,920
overcome

439
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:38,720
even if copyrightability and fair use go

440
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:38,719
for oracle so

441
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:43,120
um i just went through this

442
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:48,320
uh so let's look let let's go forward

443
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:50,560
through the uh

444
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,959
uh let's go forward through the various

445
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:55,439
amiki

446
00:15:51,959 --> 00:15:56,719
26 amiki i believe filed either in

447
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,120
support of google or in support of

448
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:01,440
neither party

449
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,480
this particular organization was done by

450
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:05,040
the disco project

451
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:07,120
i thought it was very helpful in terms

452
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,480
of just showing the range of different

453
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,800
people who were interested

454
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,399
and weighed in on this particular issue

455
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,758
i'm going to i've grouped them a little

456
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:14,480
bit differently though and i'm going to

457
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:16,800
go through

458
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:19,360
and and group them by the types of

459
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:22,479
arguments that they made

460
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:24,560
so so first were arguments regarding

461
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:26,720
copyright ability first one i'd like to

462
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:28,880
really highlight is the

463
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,839
the amicus brief by pamela pamela

464
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:33,199
samuelson

465
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:36,800
and 72 ip scholars this was

466
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:40,000
just a tour de force of

467
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,560
completely deconstructing the the the

468
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,120
law

469
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:45,599
of the the law of copyright how it

470
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:48,560
applied from baker be seldom forward

471
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,600
this is something that that uh professor

472
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:52,959
samuelson

473
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,680
has focused on her entire professional

474
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:56,800
life

475
00:16:53,680 --> 00:17:00,160
and this is an incredibly powerful

476
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:03,439
well-researched well argued

477
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:04,319
uh focus on the copyrightability

478
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:07,039
question

479
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:07,918
uh not surprisingly she because she's

480
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:09,520
our

481
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:11,839
filing in favor of google she says

482
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:14,319
google should win this one

483
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:15,520
also notable on arguments regarding

484
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:18,639
copyright ability

485
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:21,119
is the ones by manell nimmer and uh

486
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,959
genache i don't know how to pronounce

487
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:24,479
that

488
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:26,480
a lot of you people may not know there

489
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:28,880
is a famous treatise called the nimr

490
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,919
on copyright it gets quoted by courts

491
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:32,240
all the time

492
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:34,080
this nimr it was actually his dad who

493
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:35,120
started but he's been writing that

494
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:37,840
treatise

495
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:38,879
since 1985. so when people quote nimrod

496
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:41,199
copyright

497
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,000
that is that nimr and he also said you

498
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:45,039
know what this

499
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:48,160
is this is not correct under copyright

500
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:48,160
under the copyright statute

501
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:55,439
say again again yeah it's like

502
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:58,640
if kernighan weighs in on c um

503
00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:01,200
it's that heavy uh a weight uh ibm and

504
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:05,039
red hat uh

505
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:08,160
stepped up and they argued um

506
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:09,360
uh they argued pretty uh pretty

507
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,799
straightforwardly that these things

508
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,719
should be excluded from copyright

509
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:14,320
they were probably the only one that had

510
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:16,240
an exclu a

511
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:17,439
quite a bit of discussion about paris v

512
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:20,320
hexamer

513
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:22,799
that's a really fun case it was about

514
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:24,639
the copyright on a map and whether the

515
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:26,320
whether you could copyright the symbols

516
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,240
that you use to

517
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:30,399
indicate different types of development

518
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:32,400
on a map and the court said no you can't

519
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:35,440
they said this is the same thing

520
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:38,320
uh a lot of people

521
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:39,520
uh in this room that a lot of were

522
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:41,039
associated with

523
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:43,200
some of the briefs here these were

524
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:46,559
essentially the open source

525
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:50,880
organization related briefs uh

526
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:51,840
the uh the psf tide lips open uk and

527
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,080
protocol lab

528
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:56,399
brief said you know what we already have

529
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:59,439
this concept for a mixed work

530
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,400
uh of a mixed work in copyright it is a

531
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,000
useful article

532
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,520
you've already thought about how to

533
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,360
separate useful articles from

534
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,400
copyrightability stuff just apply that

535
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:10,320
test

536
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:13,919
the uh the long list of people

537
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:17,039
uh in on the mozilla brief

538
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:17,440
um said you know what this is this was

539
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:19,679
both

540
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:21,039
half of a policy brief and half of a

541
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:23,200
copyrightability brief

542
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:25,039
they said software developers rely

543
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,080
heavily heavily on the ability to

544
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:29,039
re-implement

545
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:30,000
this is one of the key tools in our key

546
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:33,760
tools in the

547
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:37,360
the toolbox it has been accepted as

548
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:39,200
accepted as okay and so

549
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:41,600
following baker b selden this should be

550
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,600
allowed

551
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:47,039
one of the most surprising briefs was

552
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,919
actually by the aipla that stands for

553
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:50,559
the american

554
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:52,160
intellectual property law association

555
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:55,760
they are traditionally very

556
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:57,600
very pro ip pro strong ip

557
00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:00,320
they technically filed in favor of

558
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:03,439
neither party but their arguments

559
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:04,240
were basically that google should google

560
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:07,200
should win

561
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:08,480
uh in fact i had to check that it was

562
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,080
actually in favor of neither party

563
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:12,240
because it came out so strongly

564
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:15,199
in terms of saying that really these

565
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:18,080
things should be excluded from copyright

566
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:20,320
um that is going to be a name that is

567
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:22,399
well known by the justices and

568
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,678
the fact that they weighed in in such a

569
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,640
definitive way is going to be

570
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:28,320
influential

571
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:31,280
the eff also uh weighed in

572
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:32,840
saying that they excluded they excluded

573
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:36,240
a bunch of

574
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:38,158
102b now turning over to fair use if you

575
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,280
want to look at sort of the definitive

576
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:42,559
fair use

577
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:45,360
uh fair fair use amicus brief

578
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:46,840
it is uh professor rebecca tuschnetz and

579
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:49,918
17 law professors

580
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:52,879
uh brief

581
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:54,720
they went through and they completely

582
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:57,600
sort of eviscerated the

583
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,960
federal circuits logic in terms of the

584
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,959
the

585
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:02,720
rebalancing of the fair use factors

586
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,000
there are four fair use factors

587
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:06,480
they said you know what they got them

588
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:09,120
wrong on all of them

589
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:10,960
also particularly notable here is the

590
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:12,799
brief by microsoft and briefed by

591
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:14,799
microsoft was very well done

592
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:16,240
but the important thing here from from

593
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:18,960
the justices perspective

594
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,600
is that the justices know microsoft they

595
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:22,320
know

596
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:23,120
like red like ibm as well but especially

597
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:25,760
microsoft

598
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:27,360
who filed on the opposite side of this

599
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:30,000
at an earlier point in the case

600
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:31,918
they know that microsoft relies on a

601
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,799
well-functioning copyright system for

602
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:36,240
software

603
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:38,480
and so having microsoft weigh in and say

604
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:40,159
yeah this is a little bit messed up

605
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:42,960
really

606
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:44,720
really uh is going to be very

607
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,400
influential notably

608
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:48,080
they filed on the fair use question

609
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:50,240
where their earlier art

610
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:51,439
their earlier amicus brief at the

611
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:53,520
federal circuit

612
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:55,600
was pro copyrightability of these

613
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:58,000
interfaces so

614
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:59,039
they are not necessarily backing down

615
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,840
from that position

616
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:02,720
but they are saying that fair use should

617
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:05,840
make these things

618
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:08,480
these apis available

619
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:09,520
moving on there are procedural arguments

620
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:11,360
i mentioned that this was the

621
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:14,639
overturning of

622
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:17,840
of a jury argument these people said

623
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:18,799
you know what this is a this was

624
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:21,840
procedurally

625
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:24,320
just terribly messed up you should

626
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:26,559
you should overturn and reverse on this

627
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:28,799
ground alone

628
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:30,559
and then you come to a lot of different

629
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:34,080
policy arguments

630
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:36,639
i've grouped these in terms of various

631
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:37,199
various themes a lot of people said this

632
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:40,240
has been

633
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:41,679
essentially the law for decades

634
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:44,880
you're going to be overturning a lot of

635
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:44,880
settled expectations

636
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:49,039
this group of people were saying

637
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:52,400
interoperability is a

638
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:56,559
core benefit that we were that

639
00:22:52,400 --> 00:23:00,000
fair use is designed to to enhance

640
00:22:56,559 --> 00:23:01,600
if you both both in terms of copyrighted

641
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,720
ability and in terms of fair use

642
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:07,600
if we don't allow this sort

643
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:08,480
of competitive reuse to occur we're

644
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:11,678
going to

645
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:14,799
lose the benefits of interoperability

646
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:18,240
wow i'm almost out of time

647
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:20,480
um a couple more

648
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,840
anti-competitive anti-competitive

649
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,360
conduct

650
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:26,799
from the american anti-trust student and

651
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,799
the retail litigation center

652
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:34,559
and against the expansion copyright now

653
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,559
i want to

654
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,720
a couple things the american library

655
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:40,080
association and some others said don't

656
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:43,600
mess up fair use

657
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:44,320
um i'd like to look for a moment while

658
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,480
i've got just

659
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:47,840
just a minute who were the people who

660
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:50,720
might support oracle

661
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:51,039
and while this is just my guess this is

662
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,600
not

663
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:54,240
actually the list of amiki these are

664
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:57,199
people

665
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,520
who seem to have expressed interest or

666
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,240
have

667
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:02,400
filed at various earlier points so this

668
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:03,360
is my guess of people who might support

669
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,960
oracle

670
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,479
and what are some of these people what

671
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:10,320
have they said

672
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:13,039
um you'll find that a lot of this

673
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:14,080
writing apis is a powerful powerfully

674
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:16,799
creative endeavor

675
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:17,360
you should not say just because this is

676
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:22,320
software

677
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:22,320
this should get less copyright concern

678
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:28,880
it is it's a bad tal bad policy the bsa

679
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:30,320
is probably going to weigh in and the ip

680
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:33,520
scholar is saying this is a

681
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:35,439
this is a property right and you should

682
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:36,960
make sure that you reinforce

683
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,960
the copyright ability of software

684
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:41,440
because that is the basis

685
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:43,200
of the entire software industry i'd like

686
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,679
to point out that to a certain extent we

687
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,400
actually

688
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:47,440
agree with that from a fast standpoint

689
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,760
we rely

690
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:52,000
on the enforceability of copyright for

691
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:56,320
all of our favorite licenses

692
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:57,039
um there's a lot of people who look like

693
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:59,120
they're probably

694
00:24:57,039 --> 00:25:00,320
going to weigh in on fair use saying

695
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:03,840
what google did

696
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:04,879
actually directly displaced oracle's

697
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,399
product in the market

698
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,640
and because it displaced oracle's

699
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:10,960
product in the market we are really

700
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:14,320
it is something that that is something

701
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:14,320
that fair use has never allowed

702
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:23,360
so i've got about one minute

703
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:24,960
i want to give a couple closing closing

704
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:27,439
thoughts

705
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:28,799
this is one of those things where why

706
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:31,919
does this matter

707
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:34,080
it matters because

708
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:34,960
the interaction of software with

709
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,399
interfaces

710
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:39,520
is something that we deal with all the

711
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:43,039
time it's an uneasy place for copyright

712
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:45,200
very concretely think about

713
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:47,520
the inclusion of an api or the use of an

714
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:49,600
api similar to the use of like

715
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:51,120
including a header file when you're

716
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:53,439
dynamically linking

717
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:54,879
if oracle's position is correct then

718
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:57,840
there's a good argument

719
00:25:54,880 --> 00:26:00,240
that dynamically linking is no different

720
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:03,678
than statically linking from a gpl to

721
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:06,960
gpl2 gpl3 perspective

722
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:08,880
whereas if if google's position the

723
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:11,440
strong google position is correct

724
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:12,400
that moves for example the lgpl and the

725
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:14,080
gpl

726
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:16,320
much closer together in terms of their

727
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:19,199
actual effect

728
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:19,678
this is something that affects lots and

729
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,880
lots

730
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:25,919
of different different products

731
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:27,279
it also affects all these services all

732
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:29,120
these web apis

733
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:30,880
now it could be that a particular api is

734
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:34,080
not creative enough to

735
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:35,200
for someone to say yes this is this is

736
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,559
copyrightable

737
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,400
but the default is going to be we're

738
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:41,200
going to need to start thinking about

739
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:42,480
every api and every network call as a

740
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:45,919
possible

741
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:53,840
source of license control

742
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:53,840
excellent questions

743
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:02,000
you
