1
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:16,160
okay

2
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:17,919
i think we can start now so hi everyone

3
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:21,279
my name is antona

4
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:24,640
and i work on openrefine so

5
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:27,840
um yeah i think okay

6
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:31,920
can i change anything to the setup now

7
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:34,079
okay great so i'm going to have a very

8
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,760
an original show of hands of who has

9
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:39,600
ever used open refine here

10
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:41,920
before wow pretty good um

11
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,719
but i would i was expecting people not

12
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,079
to

13
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,760
be completely familiar with the tool so

14
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:46,480
i'm going to do a quick demo just to

15
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,160
make sure

16
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,519
you have an idea of what the tool looks

17
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:52,000
like

18
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,039
and then i want to tell you a bit about

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,879
what we're trying to

20
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,840
do on this tool how do we want to

21
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:59,920
improve it revamp it

22
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:01,440
and hopefully you'll have some some

23
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:06,400
ideas also how we can make that

24
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:08,960
better so let me start with a quick demo

25
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,000
can you see all right yeah i think it's

26
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,559
not too bad

27
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,119
so so open refine is what people tend to

28
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,000
call an

29
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:18,080
extract transform load system so

30
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,119
basically the idea is you have data

31
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,080
in some format in some data store and

32
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:24,640
you want to

33
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:27,039
load it in your system transform it

34
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:30,079
massage it in a different format

35
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,720
and fix some issues in the data very

36
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:33,679
often

37
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,320
and then push that to another format to

38
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,119
another

39
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,399
database that has other constraints

40
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:40,720
about the data

41
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,399
and it's a web-based tool but it runs

42
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,439
locally so you need to install it and

43
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:47,439
all your data

44
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:50,559
is is on your computer and

45
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:53,679
it accepts all sorts of input formats

46
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:55,280
i'm just going to use a csv here to show

47
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:58,880
you how it works

48
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:01,600
so i just put my csv in the tool

49
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,560
oh okay it's not really meant to be used

50
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:06,240
with that much zoom

51
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:07,200
i might try to zoom out a bit and i can

52
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,478
create a project

53
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,800
with this data and this is what it looks

54
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:13,680
like

55
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,200
so this data set is about filming

56
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,720
locations in paris so basically every

57
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,599
time you want to shoot a film in paris

58
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,599
you have to

59
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:21,440
ask for permission and they keep a

60
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:23,119
record of that so you can

61
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,560
then get this information and this is

62
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:27,920
what it is about so you have

63
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:29,920
the title of the movie the director

64
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:32,399
and then all sorts of other things about

65
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:34,640
this this thumb

66
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,440
and i'll just show you a few things you

67
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,440
can do

68
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,440
in the tool to clean up this data to

69
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:42,480
transfer it to another

70
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:44,480
data store so for instance a very

71
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:47,679
popular feature of the tool

72
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:50,959
is what we call clustering so if you

73
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:53,680
take this directory column here

74
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:54,640
you can say cluster and edit and the

75
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,560
idea here

76
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,799
is that it looks at all the values in

77
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,720
this column and is going to look for

78
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,480
things that could be duplicates and you

79
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:05,040
have various ways to do that

80
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:07,040
and you have a fingerprinting method

81
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:10,000
which is the default one here

82
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,319
but you can also try to look for things

83
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,280
that

84
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:14,238
are near each other in terms of edit

85
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,920
distance

86
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:18,080
so if you play a bit with the settings

87
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:20,000
you can discover values in your data set

88
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,080
that might mean the same thing

89
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,440
and which could be errors in the data

90
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,280
set so

91
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,480
here you can review these so you can

92
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,159
guess okay these

93
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,959
are probably the same thing so i want to

94
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:33,920
merge them to this value

95
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:35,840
and then maybe this one is not actually

96
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,359
a true duplicate maybe these are two

97
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,480
different people so i want to leave that

98
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:42,319
out

99
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:45,040
and merge that and then

100
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:48,159
you can click here and it just does the

101
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:51,359
replacement in the entire table

102
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:54,000
um and the ideas all operations you

103
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,200
apply are applied uniformly on all rows

104
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,519
in your data set

105
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,238
so it's a bit more principle than excel

106
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:00,560
which is

107
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:01,360
very often the tool people come from

108
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,959
before

109
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:06,000
using openrefine so this is one thing

110
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:08,720
you can do

111
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,560
another sort of thing that i really like

112
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,359
is called reconciliation so you have

113
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,640
this

114
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:16,880
column here of titles and if you say

115
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,639
that you want to reconcile it you can

116
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:22,079
select

117
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:23,680
another database online generally

118
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,360
that you want to match this column

119
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,120
against so you have

120
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,520
names and you want to get unique

121
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:33,280
identifiers for these films for instance

122
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:36,000
you could want to take imdb ids

123
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,599
or all sorts of other identifiers for

124
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,199
these thumbs

125
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:42,160
and so here you can just pick the

126
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:45,040
database you want to match against so

127
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,840
i could use some of the ones i have here

128
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,720
or i could

129
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:50,880
add another service if a database

130
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,680
implements the api that openrefund

131
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,719
expects

132
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:56,080
to do this matching you can use that and

133
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,080
you just need to add

134
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,280
the address of the database here so it's

135
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,039
really user friendly

136
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,799
you just need to know one url and then

137
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:06,159
you can do data matching

138
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:09,520
against that database

139
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:11,360
so i'm just going to use wikidata here

140
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:14,240
we can data is this this knowledge base

141
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:16,479
created by the wikimedia foundation

142
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:19,199
and it has data about all sorts of

143
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:20,960
topics including films

144
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:23,039
so this is what it looks like you can

145
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:26,159
configure the matching

146
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:28,400
process uh in many ways you can select a

147
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,160
type that you want to

148
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,679
restrict the search to so you know that

149
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,120
these are films so you won't only want

150
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:36,000
to match these with

151
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,800
entities about films and then you can

152
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,240
also use

153
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:41,759
other columns from the table to

154
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,320
refine the matching so for instance you

155
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:46,320
can say that the director of the movie

156
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:49,599
is actually a very good

157
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:52,400
indicator that you want to keep so

158
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:54,479
you can say i want to match that to the

159
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,638
director property in weak data

160
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:58,159
and so that's going to do fuzzy matching

161
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:01,440
not just on names

162
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:04,639
of not just in titles of movies but also

163
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,639
including the director name

164
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,160
and i'm not going to do that here

165
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:11,680
because it would take quite a while

166
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,960
for these 3 000 rows so i've already

167
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,400
done it before

168
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,960
i'm just going to show you what it looks

169
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:19,919
like so this is

170
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,960
what it looks like afterwards for each

171
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:23,840
cell you have

172
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:25,120
candidates which are entities from the

173
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,840
target database

174
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:29,280
that they could correspond to so you can

175
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,799
just review these

176
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,638
manually or you can also use some

177
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,400
heuristics to

178
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:35,680
make that reviewing a bit more

179
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:39,120
principled and

180
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:43,199
and also a bit more time efficient

181
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,199
so if i click on this for instance

182
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:53,599
i get to the wikidita item

183
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:53,599
for this film okay

184
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:01,840
so these are two interesting features

185
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:04,160
that you can use to do data cleaning

186
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:06,479
one thing i haven't shown you so far is

187
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,960
the the facets on the left hand side

188
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:10,318
so these are a bit like in a search

189
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:13,198
engine when you have

190
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:14,000
summaries of the values uh in some

191
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,800
columns

192
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,080
and you can use these to filter down the

193
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,240
rows you can see

194
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,520
um to a particular subset that you

195
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,560
you're interested in

196
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:27,758
so by clicking on this matched

197
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:30,319
value here i selected all the rows where

198
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:33,199
the matching was reasonably confident

199
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:35,360
and so we already have

200
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:36,240
like valid links to weak data in these

201
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,919
cells

202
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,440
i don't have to review the candidates

203
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:42,400
here

204
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,599
and and now with this filter applied on

205
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:46,000
the left hand side

206
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:47,520
every operation i do on the table is

207
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,720
only going to be applied

208
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:52,479
to these rows so that lets you build

209
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,160
conditional workflows

210
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:56,318
which can be quite advanced you can

211
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:58,800
combine facets together

212
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:59,440
to say okay if this value is in this

213
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,160
range

214
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:04,560
and if that string is equal to that then

215
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:07,599
i want to do this operation

216
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:09,599
and all this is completely visual it's

217
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:11,599
just with this very simple ui

218
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:12,960
that people can get accustomed to quite

219
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:14,560
easily

220
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:17,599
so for instance one thing i could do

221
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:20,080
here is just take this column

222
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:21,680
and fetch more information from the

223
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:24,960
database

224
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:26,560
and add it to my local data set so wiki

225
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,840
data stores all sorts of information

226
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:31,120
about these films

227
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:33,039
and i can fetch that just by clicking on

228
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,560
the attributes i like so for instance

229
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:39,279
the genre of the film

230
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:40,880
i can fetch that or the imdb id

231
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:42,719
so this is just a preview of what you

232
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,560
would get in the table i can

233
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:46,160
again press ok and this is going to do

234
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:48,479
it for the entire table

235
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:51,120
which would take a while you can see

236
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:54,800
it's a process that

237
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:58,240
would take a little while

238
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:59,120
so that's basically a very very broad

239
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:02,320
overview

240
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:04,320
of what the tool does and it's really

241
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:07,760
popular in many communities

242
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:10,320
so we have a lot of

243
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:12,800
journalists using it librarians

244
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:15,680
researchers in general really in in

245
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:18,000
different fields and digital humanities

246
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:21,519
quite a lot

247
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,200
though in the wikimedia movement

248
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:25,440
and of course many people we don't know

249
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:30,160
because the tool is just open source and

250
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:32,880
you can use it wherever so

251
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,279
let me tell you a bit now about what we

252
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,760
do

253
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:37,040
understood the work we're trying to to

254
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:40,080
do

255
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:42,000
so it's a project that started off 10

256
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:44,560
years ago now

257
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,640
it was initially called freebase grade

258
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:50,000
works because it was made by the company

259
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:53,040
who ran freebays which was um

260
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,680
sort of crowd source knowledge graph

261
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:57,599
sort of structured wikipedia in a sense

262
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,880
and very quickly the the company got

263
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,959
brought up by google

264
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:03,360
so the tool got renamed into google

265
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:03,359
refine

266
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:08,720
and after a while google decided to stop

267
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,480
running freebase so they also stopped

268
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,480
supporting the tool

269
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,800
and they therefore converted the tool

270
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,160
into a github project it was already

271
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:18,079
open source but then they

272
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,439
sort of gave the product to the

273
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:22,479
community and renamed it

274
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,680
to remove the google branding and since

275
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,760
then the project

276
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,880
ran like that as a github project

277
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:30,240
without much

278
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:32,720
structure around it and

279
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:34,240
just last year we joined finally a

280
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:37,360
fiscal sponsor

281
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:39,040
to actually provide some some structure

282
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,240
on the project and also to manage

283
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:43,839
funding

284
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:46,640
around it so

285
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:47,120
what i want to to stress about this is

286
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,199
that

287
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,320
the the success of the tool is mostly

288
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,480
inherited from

289
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:54,240
the first few years of investment in the

290
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,480
tool where it was supported by

291
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:58,399
really big software houses which had

292
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:01,040
professional software engineers

293
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:02,240
and really actually clever people to to

294
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:05,439
build this tool

295
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:08,480
and not that much happened afterwards

296
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:10,320
so we still have the challenge of

297
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,000
taking this tool this heritage that we

298
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:15,600
have and turning it into

299
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:18,800
a viable open source project that

300
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:20,959
can run on its own really because

301
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:23,359
okay a lot quite a lot of things were

302
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:27,518
done since 2013 of course

303
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:29,360
but comparatively we're still resting on

304
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:31,680
the success of the the initial tool

305
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,680
really

306
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,399
so so what can we do to attract

307
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:39,680
contributors what can we do to make this

308
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:39,680
a sustainable project

309
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:44,000
it's very standard recipes that apply to

310
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:47,040
of course a lot of projects

311
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,760
so we tried to reach out to neighboring

312
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,599
communities

313
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,800
so because the tool was originally built

314
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,760
for freebase

315
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:54,639
we migrated it to wikidata to be able to

316
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:57,279
tap into

317
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:58,800
the the community of the entire

318
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:00,480
wikimedia movement

319
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:03,199
and so this is just a workshop in

320
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,320
amsterdam where we trained people to use

321
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:07,200
open refine

322
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:08,880
for that we also had a grant from the

323
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:11,279
google news initiative to improve

324
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:13,040
open refine for data journalism and that

325
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:14,000
was also very useful we had meeting with

326
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:16,480
people from

327
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,279
newsrooms in the us to understand better

328
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,279
what their needs are

329
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:24,320
and we improved the localization of the

330
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:26,320
tool quite a lot

331
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,920
also by making it easier for people to

332
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,920
contribute installations

333
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:31,599
and so that we use a tool called web

334
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,479
late it's a web interface to contribute

335
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,880
translations

336
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,760
and it's really really good it creates

337
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:38,560
this sort of

338
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:39,360
engage page where you can showcase the

339
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,920
translation

340
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:43,760
effort to contributors and then in our

341
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,599
experience it really brought a lot of

342
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:47,920
contributors to the project

343
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,680
and people who really feel like they own

344
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:51,519
the project it's not just

345
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:53,040
they contribute a few translations i

346
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:54,560
don't feel like they are part of the

347
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:58,399
core team that really

348
00:12:54,560 --> 00:13:01,760
get involved quite heavily so i can't

349
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:02,160
recommend that highly enough we also

350
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:05,519
started

351
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:07,120
a w3c community group to standardize

352
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:09,120
the api that underpins the

353
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:12,160
reconciliation feature i showed you

354
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:15,200
so to have open refine talk to

355
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:16,240
databases to do this this matching we

356
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,480
use an api

357
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:20,079
which was designed by the initial

358
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:23,440
designers of the tool

359
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:24,638
and it was not very documented it was

360
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,480
just

361
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:28,240
you basically had to reverse engineer

362
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,880
the tool everyone every time you wanted

363
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,000
to

364
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:33,519
implement a database for that so

365
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,639
we're trying to bring that to a better

366
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:39,519
level to document that properly

367
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:40,079
i can just show you a quick demo of what

368
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:42,959
the

369
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:44,638
specs look like now it looks like

370
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:49,279
properly nice

371
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:50,880
w3c specs um

372
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:52,639
and a lot of people who got involved in

373
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:54,160
the group also

374
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:56,160
started contributing to the tool itself

375
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:58,160
so it's great

376
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,760
we created a steering committee of high

377
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,839
profile people around the project who

378
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,720
know the ecosystem very well and can

379
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:06,320
help us find

380
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:09,120
vendors and partners to

381
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:10,240
projects to partner with and other

382
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,480
things like that so that's

383
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:15,199
really really early stages but it's

384
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:18,079
already very useful

385
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:20,079
and this year we want to apply to google

386
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:21,839
summer of code and r3

387
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:23,760
and the deadlines are just about now so

388
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:26,240
if you're also thinking about that

389
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:27,839
it's time to rush a bit for that so

390
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,199
we're not really no we're not really

391
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,000
sure what to expect from that but

392
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:33,519
hopefully it's going

393
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:36,480
to bring us nice contributors

394
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:38,560
and quite a lot of things also on the

395
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:40,000
technical side we try to revamp the

396
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,959
architecture of the tool because it's

397
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,079
quite old

398
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:47,199
and sometimes the the age of the tool

399
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:50,319
is felt in the development processes so

400
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:52,639
we had to migrate the build system

401
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:54,399
get rid of non-free dependencies as we

402
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:58,079
we mentioned earlier that

403
00:14:54,399 --> 00:15:01,360
suddenly had to do with the data package

404
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:03,680
integration in the same go

405
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:05,920
and all sorts of other things we still

406
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:09,040
have like a very old

407
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:11,040
web framework that we rely on which is

408
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:13,519
completely unmaintained and we're

409
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:17,199
probably the only users

410
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:20,320
alive it's really really crazy

411
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:23,680
so we still have to migrate out of that

412
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:24,839
and in 2020 we have pretty exciting

413
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:27,599
plans

414
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:29,360
so we want to migrate the data

415
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:33,040
processing backend

416
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:35,759
to spark so at the moment

417
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:36,319
all the data of in a project is held in

418
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:38,480
memory

419
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:40,959
so it makes it really hard to scale the

420
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:43,040
tool to larger data sets

421
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:44,560
and it's a big blocker for a lot of

422
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:47,759
users so we have

423
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:51,040
regular user surveys to check about

424
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:52,959
the needs of our users and

425
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:56,719
the main issue people have is

426
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:59,518
scalability so we want to improve that

427
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,000
and we also thought it would be good to

428
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:02,880
have

429
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,480
documentation because for now we only

430
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:07,040
have a github wiki

431
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,160
which is better than nothing but really

432
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:12,240
really not

433
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:14,160
up to the standards that it should be so

434
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,279
we're trying to work on that it's also

435
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,759
early stages

436
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:19,040
and we're still not sure what framework

437
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:20,399
we should use for that so if you have

438
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:22,240
any id about

439
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:24,320
what sort of documentation platform we

440
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:27,360
can use get in touch with us

441
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:29,440
we're still not completely sure

442
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:31,199
and that work is supported by a grant

443
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,040
from cci

444
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:34,719
from the essential open source software

445
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:37,759
for science program that

446
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:39,519
um has started a few months ago and they

447
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:40,399
have another funding cycle at the moment

448
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:42,240
so if

449
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:44,079
you think your product could be eligible

450
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:46,240
there's still a few days to apply

451
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:47,279
to the second funding cycle in this

452
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,199
grant program

453
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:51,839
so do give it a go because it's really

454
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:51,839
worth it

455
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:56,079
and i have quite a lot of open questions

456
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,480
about

457
00:16:56,079 --> 00:17:00,560
how can we better take care of this

458
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:03,600
really really nice heritage we have

459
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:06,079
of this really um

460
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,280
interesting project so because we're

461
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:09,678
trying to do all these

462
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:10,959
changes to revamp the architecture we

463
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:13,199
have to break quite a lot of

464
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:15,679
integrations with extensions because

465
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:16,640
open refine has an extension mechanism

466
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:20,160
so you can

467
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:24,160
add new features on your own

468
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:26,559
and revamping the stack means breaking

469
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:27,520
compatibility with these extensions how

470
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:29,678
can we

471
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,720
do that in a better way how can we make

472
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:32,559
sure

473
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,400
we're not putting too much strain on the

474
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:39,280
developers of these extensions

475
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:42,559
if you have any id let us know and also

476
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:45,360
a very very important question i think

477
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:46,320
is how do you manage which issues you

478
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,799
tackle

479
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:50,240
in the core team and which ones do you

480
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:51,760
leave sort of open

481
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,600
as potential hooks to bring new

482
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:56,000
contributors in

483
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,959
because of course we can do everything

484
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,280
but

485
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,880
sometimes issues are strategic in the

486
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,160
sense that if you don't work on them

487
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:05,360
people will come

488
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:06,799
and and do it um but sometimes it's

489
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:10,399
quite hard to tell

490
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:12,080
which ones are which and if yeah

491
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,559
also if you're familiar with the tool

492
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:16,799
and have any ideas about

493
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:18,160
features that are absolutely blockers or

494
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:20,480
things we should do better

495
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:22,480
do let us know because we're really

496
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:24,720
trying to get that right

497
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,760
and that's it for me so i think we

498
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:29,840
probably have time for

499
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:29,840
questions now

500
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,840
yes

501
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:50,880
so the question is about adding new

502
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:53,039
fuzzy matching algorithms in the

503
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:55,679
clustering

504
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:56,640
feature that i showed so recently we

505
00:18:55,679 --> 00:19:00,080
made that

506
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:03,200
uh part of the the tool extensible so

507
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:04,720
from now on extensions can define new

508
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:07,039
algorithms like this

509
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:08,400
um so you don't have to patch the tool

510
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:10,559
itself directly

511
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,760
and we're really keen to have more in

512
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:14,799
the tool itself i mean

513
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:17,039
there's no no problem with that

514
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:18,559
um it's just not clear for us which ones

515
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:21,760
are needed we don't have

516
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:24,480
much feedback about what is lacking

517
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:25,360
um so yeah if you have any particular

518
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:29,120
example in mind

519
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:29,120
i'm keen to hear about that

520
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:36,880
yeah yeah well my take about the how to

521
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:38,000
have more contributors my question is

522
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,240
like do you

523
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,760
have in your organization something like

524
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:44,400
a community manager or

525
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:45,679
a developer evangelist someone whose job

526
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:49,760
would be to

527
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:53,200
help people try to get into the code or

528
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:55,360
turning issues into requests

529
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,880
so the question is do we have someone in

530
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:59,520
charge in the team

531
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,799
to do developer evangelism and bring in

532
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:04,240
new contributors

533
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:05,039
um right now not really although some

534
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:08,480
people do

535
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:11,440
do a lot of work in this regard

536
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:12,400
we're still a very small team and no one

537
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,159
is actually

538
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:16,320
working permanently on the tool so far

539
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:20,320
because we've had some grants but

540
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:23,280
nothing permanent so

541
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:24,399
i sort of see it a bit as my duty as

542
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:27,440
maintainer to

543
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:29,919
make that easier to

544
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,679
ease onboarding of new contributors uh

545
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:34,000
it'd be great to have someone dedicated

546
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:34,000
to that

547
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:43,760
one feature that i would like to see is

548
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,520
i'm constantly when i'm using of the

549
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:47,760
recline exporting data

550
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:50,000
onto csv and then checking this into

551
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,000
gate

552
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:53,440
preserve history yeah i know open

553
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:55,520
refinance is only theory

554
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:57,039
so it's awesome relationship with the

555
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:59,360
frictionless data talked before

556
00:20:57,039 --> 00:21:01,200
and also with the data laptop so

557
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:02,158
integration of all this workflow would

558
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,640
be very interesting

559
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:06,640
to know to be able in a single picture

560
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:09,360
just to commit

561
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:14,720
your history of this in git yes so the

562
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:17,520
question is can we change data

563
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:19,280
because okay data is precious and you

564
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:22,240
can easily make mistakes bigger

565
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:22,240
you've got some security

566
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,760
it's always better to add something

567
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,200
right so if i understand correctly the

568
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:29,520
question is how can we

569
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,880
integrate the embedded history that we

570
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,760
have in open refinery with external

571
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:36,080
tools like git

572
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:38,158
or other pipelines systems

573
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:39,199
we're also really keen to work on this

574
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:40,640
so well

575
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,840
actually some work i started this year

576
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:45,360
already to make that easier

577
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:46,879
um so just to make sure people

578
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:49,039
understand so

579
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:50,240
this history which is the basic list of

580
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:53,760
operations you've applied

581
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:56,159
can be represented as a declarative

582
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:57,760
just a json blob which can then be

583
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:59,360
reapplied on other projects which have

584
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:00,960
the same structure so it already gives

585
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,760
you some reproducibility to your

586
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:04,000
workflows

587
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:06,158
it's really popular for people who come

588
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,039
from excel who don't have any way to do

589
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:09,520
that

590
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:11,039
in a simple way so basically you're

591
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:12,000
programming without knowing it because

592
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:14,080
you're just doing things

593
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,159
graphically and and this gives you this

594
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:19,280
workflow at the end

595
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:22,159
so what we're trying to do is um ex

596
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:23,440
expose the operations in open refine as

597
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:25,600
a java library that you could

598
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,640
use in other settings so that would be a

599
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,080
start

600
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:30,400
because at the moment it's even really

601
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:33,199
hard to just do that

602
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:34,720
and then we'd like to have integrations

603
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:37,679
with

604
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:39,760
as as as many other tools as possible

605
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:41,840
we've been thinking about adding

606
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:42,960
support for other expression languages

607
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,959
so you could

608
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,480
drop to error or drop to another

609
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,919
language in the middle of your

610
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,799
transformation and that would give you

611
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:50,880
some

612
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:53,440
some of that but it's still not quite

613
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:57,440
clear to me what it would look like

614
00:22:53,440 --> 00:23:00,240
in practice martin

615
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,240
we already see

616
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:07,039
people scratching their own needs so do

617
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:11,360
we see users turning to

618
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:13,520
contributors um yes i mean

619
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:15,199
i'm one of them really i just started

620
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:17,360
just needing the tool and

621
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:19,760
got roped into work working on it

622
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:21,918
gradually

623
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:23,440
yes i think that's a natural route

624
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:25,760
although it's quite hard because it

625
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:27,200
appeals mostly to non-technical users

626
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:29,280
and people who don't feel like

627
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,799
they're developers and they don't feel

628
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:33,039
like they could contribute to the tool

629
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:34,080
but still it happens so it's all about

630
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:35,760
trying to

631
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:37,520
get that message out that you can

632
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:39,440
contribute even if you're not like a

633
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:42,960
java programmer yet and

634
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:47,039
you have many ways to do that so

635
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:47,039
yes it's it's happening slowly

636
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:53,600
yeah i'm curious about why do you think

637
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,720
that the wiki is not the proper

638
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,719
documentation

639
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,080
and which advantage do you see in

640
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:00,320
another system

641
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:02,320
so the question is why are github wiki's

642
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:04,240
not appropriate documentations

643
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:05,918
and one thing i'd love to have is

644
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,679
localization for the documentation

645
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:08,559
because we have a very diverse user base

646
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:12,159
and very often

647
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:13,678
english is a hurdle um also versioning

648
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:15,679
i'd be able to

649
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:18,000
tell okay this is the documentation for

650
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:20,720
3.0 and 4.0 is a different

651
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,720
documentation

652
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:27,120
and also just the layout is a bit

653
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:30,559
weird and not very easy to deal with

654
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:30,559
it's not super easy to read

655
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:34,799
yeah things like that like there's a lot

656
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:38,240
of features and documentation systems

657
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:38,240
that you don't have in github wikis

658
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:47,840
yeah um

659
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:06,240
so that the downstream users can then

660
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,360
cite it properly

661
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,600
right that would be great so the

662
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:12,479
question is can we add um

663
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:13,520
provenance tracking for licensing in in

664
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:17,360
the tool

665
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:18,080
um i i'm sort of working on this this

666
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:21,360
year

667
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:23,678
by first making it possible to check

668
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:25,039
which columns was a particular column

669
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:28,000
derived from

670
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:30,158
um and that should hopefully in the

671
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,720
future make that sort of things possible

672
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:34,960
but it's still very uh very much out

673
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,960
there

674
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:43,840
thank you

675
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,320
you
