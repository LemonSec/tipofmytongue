1
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:09,280
hello and welcome

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:10,080
to this short presentation about what is

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,399
essentially

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,759
intermediaries my name is bruno i'm from

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,920
the web3 foundation

6
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:17,359
and i'm i serve there as the technical

7
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:19,600
educator

8
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:22,080
explaining what we do and what we are

9
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:25,119
developing from a technical perspective

10
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:28,479
so i mentioned intermediaries and

11
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:31,679
intermediaries are like people

12
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:34,800
or more likely institutions that

13
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:37,199
make sure that two parties in a deal

14
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,199
keep their word basically the recipient

15
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,399
the receiving party has to receive what

16
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,040
was arranged

17
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:44,480
and the sending party has to be punished

18
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,320
if they don't keep their promise

19
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,000
that's what intermediaries are and

20
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,160
intermediaries basically forward our

21
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,280
messages forward our transactions

22
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:55,279
um make sure stuff happens on our behalf

23
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,960
and indeed since humans were able to

24
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,399
stand on two legs we haven't been able

25
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,320
to trust each other and we

26
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:01,760
needed intermediaries to do that for us

27
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,559
we needed somebody to

28
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,438
uh kind of make our uh make sure that

29
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:08,798
other people

30
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:11,919
fulfill our fulfill their promises to us

31
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:13,600
so um let's dive into intermediaries a

32
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,280
little bit and define what they really

33
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,199
are what they actually do so

34
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,840
intermediaries accept messages from

35
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,840
outside sources right we are the source

36
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:25,040
and we give them a message on what to do

37
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,880
they also um act on these messages once

38
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,759
the message is authenticated as really

39
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,920
coming from us

40
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:31,360
the origin of the message then the

41
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:34,159
results of these messages

42
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:36,320
need to be computed there there has to

43
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:38,640
be some kind of outcome to this message

44
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,758
and that outcome has to be stored

45
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,840
somewhere right

46
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:43,280
so does that sound familiar it's just a

47
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,880
computer right um

48
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,640
it does the exact same thing you put

49
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,479
messages in something happens you store

50
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,520
the result and then somebody looks at it

51
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:51,920
later on and then

52
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,720
uses that as the next input for the next

53
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,560
message

54
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,880
so why have intermediaries not been

55
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,280
replaced by computers by now why do we

56
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,158
need

57
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:02,000
these intermediaries and institutions if

58
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:05,119
this is really that simple and the

59
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,920
answer is authority um well authority

60
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:08,959
and

61
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:11,120
authorization uh in a nutshell because a

62
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:12,319
computer does not have the ability or

63
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,560
the authorization

64
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:16,079
to decide something on our behalf

65
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,599
without our input

66
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,440
and this is what these intermediaries

67
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:21,200
actually do so they make decisions

68
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,359
when there's any kind of arbitration

69
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,679
when there's any kind of disagreement

70
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,760
they will decide who's right and who's

71
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,520
wrong and this is why we like them this

72
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:33,200
is why we use them today

73
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:34,000
and indeed there are many ways to relay

74
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,119
authority

75
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,360
and authorization to other people from

76
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,599
simple things like payment checks which

77
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,120
are still in use today in some primitive

78
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:44,160
societies like the united states of

79
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,879
america

80
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:48,720
to elliptic curve cryptography which is

81
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:50,560
a branch of mathematics that lets you

82
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,080
prove that you know something without

83
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,000
revealing what you know and without

84
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,760
letting anybody else impersonate your

85
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,800
knowledge later on

86
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:01,120
um and we have made

87
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,720
big strides in in forwarding this

88
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,360
authorization we made it so much

89
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:07,200
simpler to forward this authorization to

90
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,319
an authority we have usernames and

91
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,079
passwords

92
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:11,839
we have two-factor authentication to

93
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,840
make things a little bit more secured or

94
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,680
not very much if you're using sms

95
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,200
we have biometrics even which is the

96
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,000
least secure of them all but the most

97
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,720
practical

98
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,760
of them all and with all of these

99
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,319
conveniences

100
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:26,000
these these awesome awesome upgrades we

101
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:28,640
now have the ability to send

102
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,799
and receive money globally in an instant

103
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,640
we have the ability to stalk our crushes

104
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:35,120
or post our baby photos

105
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,958
we have the ability to find lost friends

106
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,760
and family or argue with strangers

107
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:39,760
online

108
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,959
we can become keyboard warriors at the

109
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,200
click of a button

110
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:44,560
we can post blogs that reach anybody

111
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,560
anywhere at any time

112
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:49,440
and are automatically promoted to

113
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,360
everybody else in that same network

114
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,480
we can even date online or whatever it

115
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,439
is you call

116
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:57,518
that when people use tinder we can also

117
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:59,760
collaborate on open source code like

118
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:02,000
this was unimaginable before

119
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:03,840
people around the world who are

120
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,920
thousands of kilometers apart can

121
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,280
work on the same software project

122
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,518
without clashes

123
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,480
and end up with an awesome product

124
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:12,480
together

125
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,399
that's launched without any central

126
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,840
oversight that they can all agree on and

127
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,000
that's amazing

128
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,000
and let's not forget that you can also

129
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,440
rent out your apartment without ever

130
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,960
actually meeting the person that you're

131
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,800
renting the apartment to that's

132
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:27,520
mind-blowingly practical right

133
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,000
i mean it lets you just earn money for

134
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,758
an empty

135
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,199
room without having to deal with people

136
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:33,120
it's great

137
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:34,720
and this intermediary takes care of that

138
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,759
dealing with people right you don't ever

139
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,720
have to meet them

140
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,160
everything happens through the

141
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,199
intermediary it's super great super

142
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,800
practical

143
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:42,639
but also it's not a coincidence

144
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,400
coincidence that the bank icon resembles

145
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:46,320
a prison because in any system of

146
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,080
perceivably horrible power somebody is

147
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:52,320
going to hoard that power

148
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:53,280
and when people abuse that system and

149
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,880
when they take

150
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,039
the power of the intermediaries that

151
00:04:54,880 --> 00:05:00,240
abuse becomes that much worse

152
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,280
so now you have institutions like paypal

153
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,280
and transfer rights

154
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,960
who have closed accounts left and right

155
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,919
without any kind of justification to

156
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,680
people they simply

157
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:09,359
do not like or to people they are

158
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,199
ordered not to like

159
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,120
transferwise itself has closed my

160
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:15,360
business account with money still in it

161
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:17,360
and refunded some customers overnight

162
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,039
and invented the reason i have yet to

163
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,479
hear back from their support two years

164
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:22,479
later

165
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:24,479
instagram has had its own metadata

166
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:24,960
leakage and allowed people to access

167
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:27,120
private

168
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:29,919
profiles of other people and to stock

169
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,840
them by using geotags on their photos

170
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:33,520
facebook is no stranger to controversy

171
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,638
they have leaks so often we don't even

172
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,320
care anymore

173
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:39,039
every week something new leaks and we

174
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:41,759
just meh whatever

175
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:43,599
twitter um has been no stranger to

176
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,840
corporate censorship and to shutting

177
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,520
down accounts it disagrees with

178
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:50,479
and that's becoming more and more of a

179
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:52,719
problem on many other platforms as well

180
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:53,919
and medium itself has built such a

181
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,080
walled garden of

182
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:57,758
posts that is impossible to exit

183
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,680
practically that they are basically

184
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:00,080
holding your content hostage and using

185
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,479
it

186
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,919
to drive revenue to the popular bloggers

187
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:05,599
while your content is there

188
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:07,120
to drive that traffic and they share

189
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,280
nothing with you

190
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,240
uh tinder and okcupid have both been

191
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,840
data mined

192
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,680
tinder uh tinder has leaked through

193
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,359
facebook integrations okay cupid was

194
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,000
data mined and some identities were

195
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,919
exposed

196
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,039
you can google that um it's very

197
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:21,840
interesting case study

198
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:22,800
and github itself has earlier has last

199
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,560
year

200
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,319
just closed down some accounts from

201
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,840
iranian developers and caused them to

202
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,639
lose months and months of their open

203
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,039
source work

204
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:32,319
just because one fat guy and a cigar

205
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:34,639
told other people

206
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:36,560
i don't like you and because he said i

207
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:37,600
don't like you github said you no longer

208
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,360
have your account

209
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,880
so the sanctions towards iran have

210
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:44,080
caused people to lose accounts

211
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:46,719
and a lot of their work airbnb

212
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:48,800
itself is being hunted in some areas of

213
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:52,240
the world where people are being

214
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:54,560
chased down for um by by

215
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,560
institutions who are under the foot of

216
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,440
the hotel lobby and others who do not

217
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,680
like this

218
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:01,120
business model and having one central

219
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,720
intermediary through all of this

220
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,400
through which all of this data goes

221
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,599
makes that makes it that much easier to

222
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:08,719
identify these people

223
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:11,039
who need to be hunted down so

224
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:13,280
power is being hoarded abused and when

225
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:15,440
it's being accessed by people who have

226
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:17,599
no who who weren't supposed to access it

227
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:19,120
the abuse is that much worse the hackers

228
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:20,159
can get your data they can use it in

229
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,240
different ways

230
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,759
and it's all around a very unhealthy

231
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,759
system it's becoming a very

232
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:27,360
dangerous system and like buckminster

233
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:29,280
fuller said you never change things by

234
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,479
fighting existing reality we cannot fix

235
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,000
this you

236
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:33,520
to change something build a new model

237
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,479
that makes the existing one

238
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:38,560
obsolete so we now have these walled

239
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:40,318
gardens where these institutions do not

240
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,319
necessarily trust each other

241
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:44,560
one computer at facebook doesn't

242
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:45,360
necessarily trust the server state of

243
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,599
twitter

244
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:50,080
their their their vision of the world

245
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:52,719
doesn't necessarily have to be in sync

246
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:54,400
um when somebody has that many likes

247
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,199
there they don't have that many likes

248
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,280
there

249
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:58,720
when one post is the truth here it

250
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,719
doesn't have to be the truth

251
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,560
there and they're doing this on purpose

252
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,080
they have no interest no incentive to

253
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:07,599
agree on content

254
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:10,878
because they rely on ads and their

255
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:12,800
ads are driven by your rage so they give

256
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:14,960
you click bait they give you posts that

257
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,720
make you upset and they make you drain

258
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:18,719
your focus they make you drain your

259
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,479
willpower in one location so that you

260
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:23,759
have no more to drain

261
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:24,800
in their competitors place this is the

262
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:26,639
system that we have

263
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,400
built and encouraged they are competing

264
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:30,879
with each other by keeping the walls

265
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:32,958
closed and by keeping the state of the

266
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:35,599
world isolated in each of these

267
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:36,399
networks and this is harming users but

268
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:39,440
benefiting

269
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:41,599
them individually so now we

270
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,519
we bring the blockchain into into

271
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:46,480
matters

272
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:47,519
the blockchain brings us a global state

273
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,839
of truth

274
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:51,040
that everybody can check at any moment

275
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:53,519
in time it's just

276
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:55,120
math and if you have a global state of

277
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:58,160
truth that nobody can say

278
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,800
is not true then the systems can trust

279
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,600
each other

280
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,160
then we have the walled gardens that are

281
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,920
becoming

282
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,839
unwalled the gardens are starting to

283
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,479
talk to each other because they have no

284
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:08,640
choice

285
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,480
if they lie it is obvious that they lie

286
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:13,279
because we can check that they're lying

287
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:15,120
mathematically but also we don't really

288
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:15,680
need these systems anymore because we

289
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,000
can trust

290
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:20,160
each other we now are participants of

291
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,560
this global system of trust

292
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:24,079
and we can trust that each of us is

293
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,800
telling the truth about what they are

294
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,959
saying

295
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,839
so we have commoditized trust we have

296
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:30,399
turned it into an

297
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:31,760
online resource and now we have the

298
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:34,880
internet of value

299
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:35,439
and trust because we have tacked a trust

300
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:38,080
level

301
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,920
on to the content that we have and so in

302
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,279
the beginning there was the

303
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,959
primitive internet where people were

304
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:44,000
skeptics and told everybody that it

305
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:46,000
would never work

306
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,320
then there was the wonderful read-only

307
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,120
internet with lots of directories

308
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,080
handmade directories static web pages

309
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:55,360
nobody was

310
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:57,200
actually evil then web 2.0 came and this

311
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,880
is where we are now walled gardens and

312
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,880
insane practicality

313
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,720
so practical we don't want to leave it

314
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,760
even in spite of all the evil that we

315
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,399
see

316
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,279
and now we have web 3.0 so web 3.0 is

317
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:10,320
the read

318
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:12,320
write trust web it's the verifiable web

319
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:15,519
it's the web where you can verify

320
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,920
a content's truth and that's that's huge

321
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:18,560
that's

322
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,920
mega powerful and but but the web 3 is

323
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,760
not just

324
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,279
blockchain right these are blockchain

325
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,800
apps that i use every day but it's the

326
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:27,680
web 3 is more than that

327
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,319
it's much more than that so the web 3 is

328
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:31,040
three

329
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,959
things it's linked data it's data that

330
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,719
machines have to understand and know how

331
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:36,239
to parse and know how to process

332
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,640
without a translator in the middle

333
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,399
without an adapter written by humans

334
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,839
that needs to be in place for the

335
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:44,640
machines to understand each other

336
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:46,560
and we've had that since like 2000 or so

337
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:48,160
then there's the distributed data so we

338
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:50,160
need to make sure that all the computers

339
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,839
that need the data have the data

340
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,279
so that we can make sure that these

341
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:54,800
computers can actually talk and can

342
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:56,160
exchange this data

343
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,160
but there's something missing because

344
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,839
we've had this since torrance right

345
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,839
something is missing and this is where

346
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:04,320
blockchain comes in blockchain adds

347
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:05,839
trust to that data so that now the

348
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,760
machines that have the data

349
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:09,839
can make sure that their copy is as

350
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:11,839
legit as everybody else's copy

351
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:13,440
and that the copy coming in is as legit

352
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:15,200
as the one that they expect

353
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,720
so now we have the internet that is

354
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,640
linked and that is

355
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,920
trusted and that is distributed and

356
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:22,160
that's the essence

357
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:24,479
of the web 3.0 this is what we're

358
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:28,079
building at the web 3.0 foundation

359
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:29,360
um web 3.0 is a system of being able to

360
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:32,079
send a message

361
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:34,240
anywhere anytime to anyone anyhow

362
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:35,839
without fear of censorship or downtime

363
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:38,160
that's all there is to it and that

364
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:39,680
message can be hello in a chat program

365
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,519
it can be forbidden content that the

366
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:43,599
chinese firewall doesn't want you to see

367
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:45,600
or it can be a financial transaction you

368
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,160
can send money to anyone anywhere in the

369
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,640
world

370
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:50,240
that's all there is to it so all we want

371
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,040
is to make it possible to transfer

372
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:55,040
messages

373
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:57,920
from anywhere to anywhere now our system

374
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,719
is the internet of blockchain in a way

375
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,560
because we

376
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,320
are building polka dot and that's a

377
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,439
system that allows other blockchains to

378
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,519
talk to each other

379
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:07,040
we are not competing with them we are

380
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:09,680
making all of them better

381
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,399
by allowing them to to share their

382
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,959
strengths

383
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:14,480
through one common system um i don't

384
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:15,920
really have time to go into this diagram

385
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,120
but i would love to explain it later if

386
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:19,439
you if you grab me

387
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,800
essentially these pink boxes are these

388
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,079
chains that are communicating and

389
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,199
they're communicating through the

390
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:25,680
central system

391
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:27,120
and these pink lines and in the middle

392
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,319
they are the communication messages

393
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,320
between the blockchains

394
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,160
we have built a system which lets

395
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,959
independent and completely unrelated

396
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,959
blockchains

397
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:37,760
securely speak to each other without

398
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:40,319
re-layers without humans doing the

399
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,959
translation and this allows us to pull

400
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,480
the greatest

401
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:44,880
strengths of all the independent

402
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:47,519
blockchain blockchains into one system

403
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:49,680
and makes the web 3.0 possible so what

404
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:51,120
we are doing with this is we are locking

405
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:54,239
the web open

406
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:56,639
by adding a new infrastructure layer on

407
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,720
top of everything that exists right now

408
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:00,399
by upgrading the system and making the

409
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,000
blockchains talk to each other

410
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:04,079
and allowing all the accompanying

411
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,040
systems like ipfs the interplanetary

412
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:07,040
file system

413
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:08,800
or whisper or swarm and all of these

414
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:11,040
other things that are being developed to

415
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,920
talk to other blockchains through this

416
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,319
system

417
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:16,479
we are effectively locking the web open

418
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:19,120
and making it forever impossible to go

419
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:21,279
back to the dystopian way of aggressive

420
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,880
data harvesting repackaging and selling

421
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:25,680
our own data back to us

422
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:26,399
that we are stuck in in the web 2.0

423
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,399
world

424
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:30,959
so this is essentially what we're doing

425
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:31,600
please go to web3.foundation to find out

426
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:34,160
more if you're

427
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,600
if you're interested grab me afterwards

428
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,719
i would love to explain everything that

429
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,079
we do

430
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,000
and if you're interested in the

431
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:42,079
practical side of things we have a

432
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,760
workshop tonight

433
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:44,959
substrate workshop substrate as a

434
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,880
framework for developing your own

435
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:48,959
blockchain that can talk to polka dot

436
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:50,240
it's two hours and in two hours you will

437
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:51,599
be developing you will develop your own

438
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:55,040
blockchain

439
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:56,560
it's free to attend just go to this url

440
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:58,319
we'll have a hands-on workshop bring

441
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,839
your laptop just make sure you install

442
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,639
the prerequisites everything's on this

443
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,399
url

444
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:04,160
and i hope to see you there for a

445
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:07,360
practical introduction of everything

446
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:08,560
that i've talked about here i have a few

447
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:12,720
seconds for questions

448
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:12,719
which i will take now thank you that's

449
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:17,839
it

450
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:21,760
uh yes um i've checked out the web

451
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:25,119
treatment

452
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:27,120
here where where oh okay i've

453
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:29,519
used the web 3.0 applications myself

454
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,959
with applications like metamask

455
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:33,519
and although i think it's quite

456
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:36,638
innovative one thing that i did not

457
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:37,920
notice was that first applications that

458
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:40,399
were previous

459
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:41,599
not monetized were now monetized because

460
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:44,000
blockchain is a

461
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,959
generally monetized platform so what i'm

462
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,760
wondering is

463
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:48,319
could blockchain be used for just data

464
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:52,240
without

465
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:55,920
a financial token or coin attached to it

466
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:57,680
yes so um the the use of your blockchain

467
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,360
is entirely up to so the question was

468
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,800
could could applications on the

469
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,000
blockchain be used without a financial

470
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,479
incentive involved

471
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,399
the blockchain itself no because you

472
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,000
need an incentive on the core layer

473
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:09,600
to keep people participating in the

474
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,120
blockchain otherwise it falls apart

475
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,120
but applications on the blockchain

476
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,519
itself yes absolutely they can and they

477
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,880
do

478
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:16,959
there are many applications that do not

479
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:18,079
have an incentive built in and that can

480
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:20,160
function perfectly well

481
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:22,319
by just providing some primitives that

482
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:24,079
you can use in other apps or directly

483
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,000
and that do not require any kind of

484
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:27,599
financial incentive interacting with the

485
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,880
blockchain itself still requires you to

486
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,560
pay some transactions

487
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,920
that's some details that we can't we

488
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,319
don't really have time to go into right

489
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,920
now

490
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:35,680
but there are many applications that you

491
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,560
do not need to have a financial

492
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,319
incentive for

493
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,839
and that are perfectly suited for for

494
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,639
the blockchain and of course there are

495
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:42,560
many more

496
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:45,120
that are absolutely ill suited for

497
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:46,719
blockchain and 99.9 stuff should never

498
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:49,759
touch a blockchain so

499
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,880
uh 99.9 just getting that out there but

500
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,759
there are things that are perfectly

501
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:55,279
suited for it

502
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:59,199
and that can and should use it yeah

503
00:15:55,279 --> 00:16:02,480
um i think we're out of time yeah

504
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:02,479
any other questions real quick

505
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,839
no okay thank you
