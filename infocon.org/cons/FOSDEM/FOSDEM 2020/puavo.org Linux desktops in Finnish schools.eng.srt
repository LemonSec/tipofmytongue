1
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:13,440
thank you

2
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,479
okay i'm joha and i came to talk about

3
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:17,039
bova.org

4
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:18,880
which is a project of our company and

5
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:19,359
it's basically the purpose of it is to

6
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,080
manage

7
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:23,119
linux desktops in large scale in finnish

8
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,839
schools

9
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:27,359
so target market is schools but i'm me

10
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,039
i've been free software hobbyist

11
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,720
for about two decades now and working

12
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:34,079
with operations over 10 years

13
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:36,160
for now so what is our company we employ

14
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,960
about 15 people

15
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,440
and we provide item solutions to schools

16
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,879
and

17
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:45,120
while we do some other things we

18
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:46,320
i think the primary thing that we do is

19
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:49,038
that we maintain

20
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,680
a quite large number of uh linux desktop

21
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:52,079
computers

22
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,360
in primary and secondary schools uh i'd

23
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:56,320
say that we maintain

24
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,960
over 5000 active uh what does active

25
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,320
mean

26
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,960
with something like uh hosts which are

27
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,400
daily

28
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:06,720
used uh by people around

29
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,960
5000 and maybe there are some like 10

30
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,640
000 less active used

31
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,960
and we also manage a lot more user

32
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,799
accounts we

33
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,080
employ about two software developer

34
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:19,200
developers usually

35
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,080
uh i'm the other one we also have other

36
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,320
kinds of people

37
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,840
product managers help desk people uh

38
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:27,279
people with teaching backgrounds

39
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:30,240
and so on so how we started out uh

40
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:32,079
uh at the time we started out uh the

41
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,798
marketplace was dominated by microsoft

42
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:36,158
windows

43
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:37,520
pretty much and we had a simple uh

44
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:39,840
business plan we are going to provide

45
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:42,158
lts for the schools ltsb stands for

46
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,960
linux terminal server project

47
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:46,000
and we provided ubuntu dom firefox

48
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,720
openoffice

49
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,200
and and such and yeah i think it was a

50
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,158
pretty

51
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,479
good business plan uh the the idea was

52
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:54,960
to

53
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:55,920
provide services that are needed by

54
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,960
schools

55
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:01,439
in a cheap way and it was good enough

56
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:03,600
at that time i think but times have

57
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:05,758
changed now it's apple with ipads and

58
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:08,000
google has chromebooks and services

59
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,878
they're competing with microsoft and i

60
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,080
feel that

61
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:13,359
we feel that thin clients are not quite

62
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,480
up to modern standards

63
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:19,200
as a technology and ltsb uh

64
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,720
feels a bit outdated i think remote x

65
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,599
doesn't really well for all

66
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:25,680
all use cases very well so basically we

67
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:27,599
have had to say goodbye to lcsp

68
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,840
and the most important reason for that

69
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:33,839
is that we mostly target laptops

70
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:36,239
these days laptops are the most uh used

71
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:39,440
kind of device in school environments

72
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:40,879
and ltsb doesn't really help with that

73
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,560
we also do provide some disclose

74
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:44,720
workstations

75
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,239
with shared home directories in server

76
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:49,280
and these reservable more like

77
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:49,280
ltsp fat lines

78
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:54,000
we started with ubuntu but then

79
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,560
canonical did a bit of a trick to us i

80
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,120
think

81
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:59,680
uh and to other people as well uh they

82
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,440
changed their ipa policy in 2015

83
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,280
and i still think that you can read that

84
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:05,359
on the uh canonical

85
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,560
web pages you can redistribute ubuntu

86
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,680
but only way there has been no

87
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,599
modification to it

88
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,599
and we certainly did modifications to

89
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:12,959
our ubuntu and we thought about this

90
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:14,399
that are we going to talk about

91
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,040
canonical about this or what are we

92
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,800
going to do

93
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,799
and we decided not to take any legal

94
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:21,360
risks and we decided to

95
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,400
make a switch to debian so okay what is

96
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,720
pu

97
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,720
uh it's basically the system that we uh

98
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,799
developed to service our customers

99
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,000
and it consists of two components mostly

100
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:32,080
the support web

101
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,360
which is web software for user and

102
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,920
device management

103
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,920
and then there's the os operating system

104
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:41,200
which is basically a special build of

105
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:43,280
debian uh linux operating system

106
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:45,920
and it's been in free software a long

107
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,280
time uh but we just haven't marketed it

108
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:49,599
as much it's basically

109
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,560
not community developed uh system we

110
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:52,480
just uh

111
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,000
use it for ourselves to service our

112
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,798
customers uh

113
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,080
and i suppose it shows in some details

114
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:00,000
that it's not a

115
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,319
product that is easy to start using by

116
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,080
outsiders but it's there it's available

117
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:06,720
for everyone to actually if you want to

118
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:09,599
do similar things you can try it out

119
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,720
and with our goals our system uh we of

120
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:12,798
course we try to

121
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:14,000
provide a good system for education we

122
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:16,400
want it to be maintainable

123
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,600
by a few enemies yet scalable to large

124
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:19,758
environments

125
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,519
we want to spot computers for a long

126
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:24,160
time i think 10 years is

127
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:24,880
about in the ballpark that if our

128
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,040
computer

129
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,800
is over 10 years old it's time to move

130
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,840
on to more modern machines i think

131
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:35,120
uh but but we try it and uh currently

132
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:38,560
we require a 64-bit support

133
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:40,479
32-bit only computers are a bit outdated

134
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,600
it's time to move on we try to be

135
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:45,599
reasonably secure

136
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,600
but we're not the bank so we're perfect

137
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:49,759
we do not want to try to depend on

138
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,000
technologies by the big three

139
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:52,800
idea companies american companies uh of

140
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,360
course the

141
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,400
tech by those can be used with our

142
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,320
system but

143
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,679
we would not like to have a heart

144
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:02,800
dependency on on

145
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:05,199
these companies and

146
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,160
yesterday james shubin gave a talk about

147
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:09,520
configuration

148
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:11,840
management engines and languages and

149
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,880
these are nice and and we use some of

150
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:16,239
that as well

151
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:18,159
uh but we have not seen much of uh open

152
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,800
source written with those languages

153
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:23,199
and we try to change that a bit it would

154
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:25,600
be nice to have a system administrator

155
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:26,800
a system administration called released

156
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,639
as open source

157
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:31,280
which could be used to build systems

158
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:34,320
used actually used in the real world

159
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:36,080
uh we have uh uh

160
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,360
power has a two different major

161
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,800
components the web

162
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,120
part is the other one it's a ruby on

163
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:44,240
rails application but

164
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:45,360
unusually we do not use a relational

165
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,720
database we use

166
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:51,759
ldap for it and

167
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,440
this is for some reasons we

168
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:54,960
we use a separate database for each

169
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,479
organization but we can use one

170
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,599
sensorless installation for all

171
00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:00,400
organizations

172
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:02,319
we use mit kerberos which can be used to

173
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:05,440
provide a single sign-on which is good

174
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:09,120
so that people don't have to log in

175
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:11,440
to different separately login to each

176
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,759
web application that they need to use

177
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:16,000
and for each organization can have

178
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:17,400
its own school servers and we can keep

179
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
organizations

180
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,799
organizations specific uh copy of the

181
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,720
database

182
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,000
uh as a read only copy on the school

183
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,560
servers

184
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,160
uh the web has user management part it

185
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,280
has pretty much the standard stuff that

186
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:32,560
you would expect

187
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:35,359
to such a thing to have it has a

188
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:37,520
hierarchy of entities and uh some usual

189
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,440
users can have special permissions to do

190
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:42,479
things such as uh change student

191
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,479
passwords if they want to

192
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,639
we can also provide ldap access to

193
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:48,560
external applications

194
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:50,319
such as moodle so that you can use

195
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,360
directly the user database for

196
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:53,280
authentication

197
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,599
and such and we can also use to some

198
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,960
extent uh external user databases as a

199
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:59,840
source for user information

200
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,400
we have some microsoft ad integration

201
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,840
mostly

202
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,840
i think that is it

203
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:11,198
we also have device management uh

204
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:11,919
we have a we keep a database of devices

205
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:13,840
in school

206
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:15,039
and they prove can be used to manage

207
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,359
power os hosts

208
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:18,400
to some extent and affect their

209
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,840
functionality

210
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:22,000
and we also gather a bit of information

211
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,758
how the devices are used

212
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
and then the support of os part we

213
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:29,280
currently based on debian stretch

214
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,280
buster is almost ready for production

215
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,719
this is something that i would would

216
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,719
could say a few words on

217
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,919
uh the the we tend to be a bit

218
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,479
conservative we

219
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:39,758
still certainly prefer to follow the db

220
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:42,400
unstable releases

221
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:44,479
i think we're a bit uh slow a bit too

222
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:46,560
slow in following that but but

223
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:48,159
still it's it's the best environment for

224
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:51,360
schools i think slow moving

225
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:53,599
reliable is good uh we used to

226
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,520
be based on ltsb but we have diverged

227
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:58,240
because of the laptop issue

228
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,120
and we no longer have a ltsp as a

229
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,560
dependency

230
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,400
if you actually want a school

231
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,160
environment with ltsb

232
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:06,400
the scholar linux is an option i think

233
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:09,520
they have a stand here

234
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:10,479
uh yeah and how we distribute the power

235
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:13,280
o is it's we

236
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:14,878
basically make a squash office image

237
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,359
which is a compressed read-only disk

238
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:17,680
image

239
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,520
and we update it updated automatically

240
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,199
without any disruption for users so

241
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:23,120
so in the ideal case and it works pretty

242
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:26,240
well users never notice any update

243
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:29,759
updates in any way the desktop

244
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,879
is gnome 3 but gnome 3 in its default

245
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:34,000
setting is a bit

246
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:35,680
uh strange for people i think so we

247
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,880
tweak it with extensions to behave more

248
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,359
like windows which is something that

249
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,640
they are

250
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:42,560
being used and we provide

251
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:44,159
basically the standard stuff that you

252
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,560
would expect to have in a free software

253
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:47,920
desk

254
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:49,199
environment and we have some special

255
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:52,000
features i think

256
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,720
uh this is a bit crazy and strange i

257
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,279
think we

258
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:57,040
use the same system image for different

259
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:59,839
hosts that can have different

260
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:01,360
uh modes of functioning and we basically

261
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:03,680
use the same system image

262
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,560
for boot servers laptops and displaced

263
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:07,839
workstations

264
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,399
so basically how we do it we build an

265
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,959
image

266
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:11,839
and then we put the image on the host

267
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:14,399
and before we

268
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:15,920
give control to systemd we use our

269
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:18,080
special init tricks

270
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:19,839
to set it up the environment so that it

271
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:22,240
functions properly in that role

272
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:23,360
so both servers configure themselves as

273
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,560
nfs servers

274
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:28,240
before system day takes over and then we

275
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:32,000
can build a diskplace workstation

276
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:34,320
using the same image through npd

277
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,040
and then the discourse workstation is

278
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:39,760
going to be configured as an nfs client

279
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:41,839
and then they work together and maybe

280
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:43,920
it's a bit strange but it works for us

281
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:46,080
because we can then use the same

282
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:49,360
installer and same updates mechanism

283
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:51,279
for each each type of host we also

284
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:53,360
provide automatic power of when idle

285
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:56,800
during non-school hours guest loggings

286
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,800
uh other strange features

287
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,920
what about google is is it a friend or

288
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,000
an enemy uh

289
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:03,279
in practice schools need environments

290
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,480
for collaboration it's not

291
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:06,959
simply enough to have hosts and

292
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:08,079
computers and networks and applications

293
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:10,000
there needs to be some kind of

294
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:11,760
environment that they collaborate in

295
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,760
and in practice our system tends to get

296
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:15,439
paired with google apps for education

297
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:18,079
which is on the other hand it's a good

298
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:20,160
thing because if that didn't exist

299
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:21,599
i think we would be uh schools would

300
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,199
probably use something like microsd

301
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,120
office online or something like that

302
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,839
and we would be in trouble uh there used

303
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:29,200
to be uh uh

304
00:10:26,839 --> 00:10:29,920
interoperability issues with linux

305
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,480
browsers

306
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,120
uh in in fact you had to fake the user

307
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,440
agent

308
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:37,040
uh for it to work uh things have gotten

309
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:39,440
a bit better these days but it may be

310
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:41,920
partially because of the google apps

311
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,760
for education and sometimes it feels as

312
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:47,360
if we have become a thin client provider

313
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:50,480
for proprietary google app services

314
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:51,040
and it's it's a bit problematic from the

315
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,200
privacy

316
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:55,199
point of view i think uh sometimes it

317
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:57,120
feels as if we are

318
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,560
teaching children how to use spyware in

319
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,040
schools even though i

320
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:02,399
realize that they don't they promise

321
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,000
that they don't actually exploit the

322
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:06,160
data

323
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,680
uh the so maybe there could be a

324
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,240
previous conscious school market out

325
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,239
there

326
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:12,000
uh this is something that we might do in

327
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,680
the future uh

328
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,120
a next club looks interesting

329
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,880
collaborator office

330
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,399
things like that but at the moment it

331
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,760
feels that in finland

332
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:23,040
there is no market for these people are

333
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:25,680
just content to use the google services

334
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:28,240
but i have heard or understood that in

335
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:31,279
some other countries such as germany uh

336
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:34,800
the the politics and the legal

337
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:37,600
legalities are such that uh the it's not

338
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,560
just so simple to just put student or

339
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,959
children data

340
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:42,560
to to american companies so this might

341
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:44,560
be an interesting uh

342
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:46,000
development that we should do but it

343
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,439
hasn't happened yet

344
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,040
uh what we also need is better

345
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,519
documentation and we should

346
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:53,040
probably fix issues so that everything

347
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:55,040
works more like out of the box

348
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,560
uh currently what we do appears to be

349
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,319
something as if it's

350
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:00,719
done by administrators to other

351
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,480
administrators which is which is true

352
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,639
and you should realize it if you try it

353
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,639
out

354
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:09,600
this one one image to rule them all

355
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:11,120
strategy is is also good

356
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:14,160
but it's not perfect maybe something

357
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:17,040
like guix or nixos is something that we

358
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,519
might want to look into in the future so

359
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,360
if

360
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:21,920
you want to deploy linux desktop

361
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:25,200
desktops or laptops in schools

362
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:26,800
uh if you have just ten hosts to

363
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,720
maintain don't bother with this

364
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:31,040
if you have a hundred i don't know what

365
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:33,760
you should do if you have a thousand

366
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:34,560
this might be just what you need uh we

367
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,880
also have a

368
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:38,719
uh there are also a few schools uh that

369
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:42,880
use our technology in switzerland and

370
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,880
in germany with some experience

371
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,719
okay this is not related forget

372
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:49,120
everything that i said

373
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,720
this is not related to what we what i

374
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,720
just talked i just want to give a

375
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,320
quick note in which other way linux is

376
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,880
present in finnish schools

377
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,560
and this is not related to puebla in the

378
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:00,399
final year of upper secondary school

379
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:02,638
there are final examinations that have

380
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:05,519
been digital for some years now

381
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:06,320
and the examination software for that is

382
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:08,320
proprietary

383
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,920
i have heard that someday that might

384
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,480
actually change it would be a very good

385
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:13,360
thing

386
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:15,440
but so far it hasn't hasn't happened but

387
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:18,320
anyway for the examination

388
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:19,200
uh the students must provide their own

389
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:22,240
laptops

390
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:25,519
and their uh examination

391
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:27,920
system the client side is is

392
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:28,800
delivered as in usb drives and it's a

393
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,120
linux system

394
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,399
uh based on debian and this creates a

395
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,600
strong incentive for high school

396
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:34,079
students to buy linux compatible

397
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,680
hardware

398
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:38,479
because they have to provide provide

399
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:40,479
their own uh in the final examination

400
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:42,480
and if you go to finland in some

401
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:44,959
computer source you might see this

402
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,079
uh sticker on the on the computers which

403
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:47,920
basically says that it's

404
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:50,079
this computer is final examination

405
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:52,319
compatible it basically means that

406
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:53,920
it's linux compatible but it's marketed

407
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:56,800
as such because that's what the

408
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:58,800
students care about so okay we have one

409
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:03,839
minute for questions if you have any

410
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:03,839
please shoot

411
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,680
thank you uh i'd like to know um how do

412
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,519
you perform the initial

413
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:15,760
installation on the laptops of your

414
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:18,240
image

415
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:19,120
we have our own installer for it sorry

416
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,959
we have our own

417
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:23,360
installer for it we basically partition

418
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:25,518
it ourselves and uh

419
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,959
basically it takes about three minutes

420
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:28,720
on a fast network

421
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:30,399
if it takes more than that somebody's

422
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,000
going to complain so it has to be very

423
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:34,240
fast we basically just create the file

424
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,680
systems and then copy the necessary

425
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,680
uh files in place

426
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:44,000
and the laptops which are then installed

427
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:46,719
with this power system are they

428
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,639
then uh dependent on having a connection

429
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,639
to the server or can they also be taken

430
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:51,920
elsewhere and like used independently

431
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:53,519
without the connection to this

432
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:55,599
yes they can absolutely that's

433
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:56,839
absolutely a requirement that laptops

434
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:59,600
can be

435
00:14:56,839 --> 00:15:00,480
uh can function without a network

436
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,440
connection

437
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:05,199
and don't really need a connection to

438
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,959
pueblo centralized power server for

439
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:09,279
functioning

440
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:11,119
what makes a school environment unique

441
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:12,560
for device management what makes it

442
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:15,040
different from other

443
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:16,000
situations where you manage devices on a

444
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,240
large scale

445
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,240
uh

446
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:24,959
well it has to there's no time

447
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,800
it's actually a good question and it

448
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:29,040
didn't necess it isn't necessarily so

449
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,839
i think the school environments uh the

450
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,639
the

451
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:32,959
requirements are pretty uniform mostly

452
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:35,519
so

453
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:37,119
so if if one well this is not something

454
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:38,639
that i would push to developers because

455
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,440
developers would like to install this

456
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:41,920
and that and do that

457
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:43,920
and that and so on so so it's it's the

458
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:46,079
requirements are pretty uniform

459
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:47,120
and for that reason so that everything

460
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:51,359
works without

461
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:54,880
hitch is is the the main requirement

462
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:56,190
okay okay thank you for your talk

463
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:59,249
[Applause]

464
