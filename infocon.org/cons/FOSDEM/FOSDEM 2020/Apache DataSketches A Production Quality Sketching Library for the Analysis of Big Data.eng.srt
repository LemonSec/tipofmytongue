1
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:08,480
did the original

2
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:09,760
talk that i heard at apache con and he

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:12,000
was going to do this one but but

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:14,320
couldn't make it so

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,200
we'll see how well this goes uh anyway

6
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,560
this is me

7
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,520
if you want to get hold of me later and

8
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:23,119
we're going to talk about data sketches

9
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:26,000
um we'll talk about the conceptual

10
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:29,039
framework i'll go through a case study

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,320
i'm going to look at quantile processing

12
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:31,920
in a little more depth than anything

13
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,719
else we'll look at some of the other

14
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,760
algorithms

15
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:36,719
and then some additional information and

16
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,599
references

17
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:41,360
so what are data sketches they're well

18
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,040
first off it's currently an apache

19
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:46,000
incubator project which means

20
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,800
apache's got it it's been released to

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,920
apache

22
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,519
they're going through the process of

23
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,280
making sure it's got all its licenses

24
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,440
and good things like that

25
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,719
but it is in production it's used by a

26
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,599
number of companies in production

27
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:57,360
currently

28
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,719
so we're apache is basically just

29
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,719
cleaning it up and making sure that all

30
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:02,559
the licenses like i said are valid and

31
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,799
are meet the apache standards things

32
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:07,039
like that

33
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:09,360
but the data the program itself is a

34
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,360
it's a

35
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:13,199
stochatic streaming algorithms called

36
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,960
sketches that's the

37
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,040
general term in the industry and these

38
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:19,360
are basically processes that

39
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,280
that deal with very large amounts of

40
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:25,119
data in a very small space

41
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:28,400
and they give you estimates uh of values

42
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:30,240
with mathematically provable uh error

43
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,720
ranges

44
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,759
and the apache sketches are available in

45
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:38,240
java and c

46
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:38,240
and or c plus plus and python

47
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,840
and so they're fairly recent in

48
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,439
development

49
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,920
uh they're also called approximately

50
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:49,839
approximate query processing

51
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:51,280
the um the idea is you extract the data

52
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,920
in one pass so you're not going to

53
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,920
handle your data multiple times

54
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,520
and the the term sketch really comes

55
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,040
from the idea of like an artist sketch

56
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,880
where you kind of get the idea of what

57
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,399
the landscape looks like without having

58
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,000
every little detail

59
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:05,119
data sketches do much the same thing

60
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,920
they're going to give you an idea of

61
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:08,160
what the data

62
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:11,200
landscape looks like without giving you

63
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,200
every little detail

64
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,239
okay so some of the common properties of

65
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,480
these sketches are

66
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:20,480
they are one touch that is you don't

67
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:23,119
process the data more than once

68
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:24,640
they're mergeable so you can run the

69
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:27,840
processes in different streams and then

70
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:31,040
later merge those streams together

71
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,840
uh they are sublinear meaning that while

72
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,519
they start out at

73
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,280
a given size that's much smaller than

74
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:38,400
the data set that you're looking at

75
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,440
as your data increases the the size of

76
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,440
the sketch does not

77
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:43,840
increase linearly with the size of your

78
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:47,280
data so they're much smaller than

79
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:49,200
the data stream and they are the query

80
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:52,560
results are approximate

81
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,359
and they have a well-known uh error

82
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,519
bounds

83
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,519
and you can make this make decisions

84
00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:01,599
early on to trade those off

85
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:01,599
the size or the or the the error

86
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,359
they are also like i said designed for

87
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,519
large-scale processing

88
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,360
and then from apache you're going to get

89
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:12,080
the what you expect from apache

90
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,640
there's maven deployable it's got unit

91
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,280
tests

92
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,559
and testing tools are all there and

93
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,640
there's the documentation

94
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:21,360
and the developer resources that you get

95
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,359
from apache

96
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:29,839
so we'll look at a case study um

97
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:32,239
a project called flurry and in flurry

98
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,760
there were it was a process or a project

99
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:35,840
that managed

100
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,440
uh mobile app it was for mobile app

101
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,720
developers to manage their

102
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:42,400
products okay there are 250 000

103
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,239
or more than 250 000 mobile app

104
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,159
developers on the system

105
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:47,280
they were producing 50 to 60 terabytes

106
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:50,640
of data a day

107
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:53,200
or 40 to 50 terabytes of data um

108
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,720
and then at the you know as a mobile

109
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,399
developer you want to know how many

110
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,239
visitors did i have on my site how many

111
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,640
how much time did they spend on various

112
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:02,400
uh parts of the site what were they

113
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:05,839
doing

114
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:07,840
uh to do those kinds of queries

115
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:10,239
on the before the the data sketches were

116
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,879
implemented it would take about 80

117
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:12,799
billion

118
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:14,480
virtual core seconds so that's you know

119
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:15,360
spread across all the processors they

120
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,120
had

121
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,639
and if you wanted to know at the end of

122
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,079
the day how many

123
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:22,000
you know unique visitors you had that

124
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:23,919
did such and such a thing

125
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,919
it would take two to eight hours to run

126
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:29,039
those queries for the users

127
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:30,799
right for the the app developers

128
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,240
this isn't uh something that's

129
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,280
sustainable you know as an app developer

130
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,479
you really want to know a little more

131
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,599
frequently than that

132
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:37,680
be really nice if you could do it in

133
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,360
real time um

134
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,720
you know and if you wanted questions

135
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,479
over weekly data

136
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,840
that would take even longer to take days

137
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:46,400
to get that

138
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:48,000
once they implemented the the data

139
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,799
sketches

140
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,880
the virtual core seconds dropped you

141
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:55,600
know to 20 billion so significantly

142
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,080
cheaper to operate and on top of that it

143
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,600
gets

144
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,359
much faster you can answer these

145
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:03,520
questions now in 15 seconds

146
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:05,759
rather than days um

147
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:07,758
but again the previous the earlier one

148
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:09,360
you got exact counts

149
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:11,919
and in the second case we're going to

150
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:17,039
get approximate counts so you're trading

151
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:17,039
exactitude for for speed and cost

152
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,360
right so we'll look at the quantile

153
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,840
sketch first and then look at how that

154
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,280
works

155
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:26,960
in some depth so first of all

156
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:29,039
it's an estimate of distribution for

157
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:32,080
those you don't know

158
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:33,440
um and you get basically if you have

159
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:36,800
something that you can compare

160
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:39,120
that you can put them in an order

161
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,919
then you can run a quantile sketch so

162
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,600
this could be

163
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:43,919
the amount of time people spend on a

164
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:46,000
page for example

165
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:47,198
uh and then you you get a rank here the

166
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,880
fractional rank tells you

167
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:50,560
you know what how much time each people

168
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:52,639
or how many people that were across it

169
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,000
you get so you get the first one and

170
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:55,440
then you can take the first one you can

171
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,720
actually transform it to the second one

172
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,560
which is you know sort of what your

173
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,759
management wants to look at or

174
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,919
somebody who wants these reports they

175
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,120
want to know it's nice

176
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:04,400
they like to look at these nice charts

177
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,759
and show you this nice bell curve kind

178
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,440
of things that yeah they've spent about

179
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:08,880
this much time

180
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:11,919
that's the kind of thing you can get out

181
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,919
of a quantile sketch

182
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:17,039
now the the java code to do this is

183
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,560
fairly straightforward

184
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:20,318
and i'm going to actually do a couple of

185
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,520
things here i want to show that we're

186
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:24,960
going to create two

187
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:27,280
sketches first off um so

188
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,960
this could be two data streams where

189
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,318
you're looking at what are people using

190
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,000
doing on different systems and you want

191
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:33,199
to merge them together so perhaps over

192
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,319
the same time what did they do in the

193
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:36,479
last hour

194
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:37,440
or it could be this is the data stream

195
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:39,120
for day one

196
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,319
and the data stream for day two and when

197
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,199
i merge them together i'm gonna have the

198
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:43,520
data for

199
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:45,199
two days okay so you can you can do

200
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,400
either one of those things

201
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:48,319
in this type of arrangement so what

202
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:52,239
we've got here is we're building the

203
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:54,720
um the first data stream

204
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:57,120
we go through and we basically create a

205
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,720
time sketch

206
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,160
this is called a time one sketch and

207
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,840
time two sketch

208
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,440
and we're simply looking at the the

209
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,479
double values coming out and sticking

210
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:07,840
them into the

211
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:10,560
into the sketch all right

212
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:11,840
so then and presumably we've we've

213
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,319
stored them now

214
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:16,479
uh so in the second part of this example

215
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:18,319
we load the time sketches back

216
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:19,919
and there are simple mechanisms to read

217
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:22,160
and write those from file systems or

218
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:23,840
databases

219
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,919
so you read the two sketches back you

220
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:28,560
create a union you put the two

221
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:29,280
two sketches into it and now we've got a

222
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,039
sketch

223
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,880
that is the result of the the union of

224
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:35,599
those two sketches so like i said that

225
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,560
that new result is either the two the

226
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:38,479
two days or

227
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,000
you know the one hour of across the two

228
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:43,199
systems

229
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,039
um and then

230
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:46,479
we can print out the results so we can

231
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:48,479
the first case here

232
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:49,758
we're looking at the the min the median

233
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:52,878
and the max value

234
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,879
uh we know that it's a

235
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,479
it's going to be between zero and one so

236
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,240
we're looking at zero point five and one

237
00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:01,120
that'll give us the minimum

238
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:03,039
median and maximum value the second case

239
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:05,840
is we're looking at

240
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:06,400
uh we want to know the values that are

241
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,638
less than

242
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,758
infinity or from negative infinity to

243
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:13,120
not two

244
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:15,680
from two to not zero zero to

245
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,319
uh not two actually should be negative

246
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,120
two sorry

247
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:19,520
then two to n zero not two and then two

248
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:23,199
to

249
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:24,639
uh infinity all right and this

250
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:27,120
breaking it down into the bins here is

251
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:29,280
gonna break the histogram down

252
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:31,360
into those ranges then we simply print

253
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,559
it out and we would get a chart that

254
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,719
showed that

255
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:36,000
and then finally we can do the frequency

256
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:37,039
that's the probability and then we knew

257
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,640
the frequency

258
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:40,958
where again we're breaking it down and

259
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:44,718
creating a frequency

260
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:44,718
histogram at the end

261
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,480
okay so some of the other

262
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,800
sketches we have are the the count

263
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,760
distinct so this is you know you've got

264
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,439
you want to know how many unique

265
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:57,439
visitors you had you want to know how

266
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,959
many times a unique event happened

267
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,640
this would would be able to do that

268
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:03,199
there are a couple of them

269
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:06,480
available there you've got the the theta

270
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,480
sketch framework which is

271
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:12,080
it it's ideas it's main

272
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,439
goal is that you can do these uh tests

273
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,440
both on or off

274
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,800
java heap so you can do in the system

275
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:19,920
space or not

276
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:21,199
um and it provides the three things you

277
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,240
can do with it you can do the union you

278
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,920
can do an intersection

279
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,080
and you can do difference operations on

280
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,360
it so if that if those are important

281
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,680
you probably want to use the theta

282
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,399
sketch the hyper log log which is the

283
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:33,439
second

284
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:35,600
type here uh is much smaller

285
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,519
it's uh so if you if you're concerned

286
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,440
about doing something in a very small

287
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:42,720
space perhaps on a mobile device

288
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:44,480
you might want to use a hyperlog log um

289
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,000
and then but it can only do union

290
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,040
operations so if you've got to do the

291
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,240
other operations

292
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,680
this isn't going to work for you and

293
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,480
then finally there's a new one that just

294
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,640
came out

295
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:55,440
this the cpc sketch the compressed

296
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:56,880
probabilities probabilistic counting

297
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,720
don't know much about it but i've been

298
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:01,920
told that it is smaller

299
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:03,600
more accurate provides the best

300
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:05,360
accuracy for the amount of storage

301
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:09,440
you're using so it's better than the

302
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:09,440
the theta sketch in that respect respect

303
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,680
we have a freedom items sketch this is

304
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,560
also

305
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:18,000
heavy hitters so if you doing a shopping

306
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,599
site you want to know

307
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,320
you know what are people buying right

308
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:24,000
now those would be your heavy hitters

309
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,279
so you might you know put those at the

310
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,399
top of the page and try to get more

311
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:27,120
people to buy them or something like

312
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:29,200
that

313
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,800
that's what the heavy hitters does and

314
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,519
again this is a case of the bigger the

315
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,880
sketch

316
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:34,560
the more heavy hitters are going to be

317
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,360
able to detect if you have a very small

318
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,680
sketch you might

319
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,760
you know get two or three depending on

320
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:43,199
on how what the distribution of data

321
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:43,200
looks like in the actual data

322
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:49,439
finally we have a tuple sketch which is

323
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,279
takes the theta sketch and extends it so

324
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,680
you can add other data to it so you have

325
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:53,760
a

326
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:55,199
unique count kind of thing you say

327
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,120
unique counts with

328
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,320
you know they clicked on this thing

329
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,120
however many times they clicked on it

330
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,279
that kind of

331
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,640
associative data that's what the tuple

332
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:06,959
sketch will do

333
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:09,360
for you uh and then we have sampling

334
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:10,479
so we have like the the reservoir

335
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,760
sampling problem

336
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,760
where you're looking at a stream of data

337
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,200
and you want to get a good random sample

338
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:18,480
across your stream of data

339
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:20,000
the sampling sketch will do that

340
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,920
and it does it with with objects not

341
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,120
just so you can look at objects coming

342
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:26,959
across you can do some

343
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:29,839
some work with that frequent directions

344
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:31,518
which is this single value decomposition

345
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:32,800
which is something i don't understand

346
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:34,079
actually i've looked it up and i still

347
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,000
don't understand it

348
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:38,000
but my understanding is that it's

349
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,040
actually used in

350
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,480
finding similar uh

351
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,000
first like shopping comparison site or

352
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,200
shopping sites for somebody said that

353
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,240
the other guy bought this maybe you want

354
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,920
to buy it

355
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,279
that's the kind of processing that this

356
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,560
would be useful for

357
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:52,000
if you know the term single value

358
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,599
decomposition you'll understand what

359
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,720
this slide means

360
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:58,800
um so and then uh

361
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:01,040
we have the number of uh places from

362
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:04,160
apache that you can get the

363
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:07,279
the information on the uh the system

364
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:09,120
and uh we'll end up here with i want to

365
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:10,880
thank lee rhodes who couldn't be here

366
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,560
today but he spent an awful lot of time

367
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:14,480
with me on the phone trying to get me to

368
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,920
understand how this works so i can come

369
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,519
talk to you about it

370
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:19,279
and then these other gentlemen are all

371
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:20,959
people who helped develop the the data

372
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:24,000
sketches over time

373
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:25,599
uh in the last couple years or so

374
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,279
and then i've got a list of references

375
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,079
and these slides are available on the

376
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:31,200
fosdem

377
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:33,680
website uh as a link from this talk

378
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,880
so if you want to come back and get any

379
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:37,920
of the information

380
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:39,990
feel free to do that and that's uh

381
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:45,490
that's it for me

382
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:45,490
[Applause]

383
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,959
i have 30 seconds left

384
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:53,839
is it time for one question i don't know

385
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:59,040
no because the microphone won't come on

386
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:07,839
saved

387
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,360
questions are there any questions

00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:32,240
well i'll be up outside if anybody wants

389
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:32,239
