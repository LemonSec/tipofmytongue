1
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:08,639
hi everybody

2
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:10,240
uh for those who don't know me my name

3
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:12,239
is mike blinkovich i'm the executive

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,799
director of the eclipse foundation

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,400
um and my talk today is called jakarta

6
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:18,880
ee free at last

7
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:21,038
probably an excessive title but i got a

8
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:23,680
bunch of people in a room so it worked

9
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:25,119
um so the talk is really about what

10
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,480
we've been doing for the last two and a

11
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:29,359
half years

12
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:31,279
transitioning the technology formerly

13
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:33,680
known as java ee

14
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:34,800
from the oracle and jcp over to the

15
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,280
eclipse foundation

16
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,559
and um a little bit of what that means

17
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,360
so this is not

18
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:42,800
this is not a technical talk um i'm

19
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:45,039
happy to answer questions to the best of

20
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:48,480
my ability as we go through this

21
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:53,760
but my ability to

22
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:53,760
to write code expired a long time ago

23
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:00,079
so

24
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,519
all right so uh we'll talk a little bit

25
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:02,480
about how this thing whole thing got

26
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,879
started

27
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,240
um a little bit about how the java ee

28
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:07,840
ecosystem works

29
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,280
um for those of people that are in the

30
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,840
java ecosystem some of this is gonna be

31
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:14,080
familiar

32
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:16,560
um what we actually did to pick this

33
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:18,080
technology platform up and move it and

34
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,200
then a little bit on on what we

35
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,720
um uh what's going on moving forward in

36
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,479
jakarta ee9

37
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,240
and then finally sort of closed with a

38
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:29,520
little bit of a report card

39
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,720
compared to where we ended up relative

40
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,679
to

41
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,880
the original expectations so it's hard

42
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:39,439
to believe but this

43
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:40,640
whole adventure began in 2017

44
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:42,720
sir i can't remember if it was still

45
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,119
java one or if it was code one do you

46
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,798
remember

47
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:46,320
george this might have been the last

48
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:49,600
java one

49
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:52,158
and uh so um this

50
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:54,240
crazy oracle vp name mark cavage stood

51
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:55,920
up on stage with um

52
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,439
some folks from ibm red hat and tommy

53
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,680
tribe and said that

54
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:00,798
they were going to pick up and and move

55
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,799
originally they was going to they were

56
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:04,880
going to move to some foundation

57
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:06,159
um and they talked to apache they talked

58
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,719
to linux they talked to us and

59
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:08,640
eventually

60
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:11,038
there was a decision made to to move it

61
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:13,519
to eclipse

62
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:15,279
and so what they talked and so these

63
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,560
this next couple of slides are basically

64
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,720
these are the slides that

65
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,120
that oracle themselves prepared to

66
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:23,920
explain what was going on to folks

67
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,280
um and so basically they want to move

68
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:28,799
the community and vendors

69
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:30,560
into a uh vendor neutral open source

70
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,360
foundation to take over the management

71
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,200
of

72
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,280
of this and there's a lot of good

73
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,640
reasons why be more agile flexible open

74
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,879
compatible

75
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,720
while retaining compatibility all

76
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:42,480
perfectly good motivations

77
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,239
but a big part of the reason why they

78
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,238
wanted to move is because

79
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:47,760
you know economically oracle was tired

80
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:49,519
of carrying the weight of the whole

81
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,440
thing themselves

82
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:52,640
and the other vendors particularly ibm

83
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,560
and red hat said hey

84
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:56,079
if you want our participation we're not

85
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,200
going to do that under the status quo

86
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,080
you need to you need to

87
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:02,959
change the game and this was the game

88
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:05,519
they decided to change to

89
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:06,800
um so when we talking about what it was

90
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:08,400
that we were originally trying to do

91
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,080
is well we want obviously the eclipse

92
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,159
foundation is an open source foundation

93
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,319
open by default is everything that we do

94
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:16,480
so open process

95
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:18,319
we have lots of practice at getting

96
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,440
large vendors to collaborate together

97
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:21,200
it's kind of

98
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,560
a bit sort of our secret sauce as an

99
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:25,839
organization

100
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:27,599
um transition the ee for jay in calendar

101
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,920
year 2018.

102
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:32,959
um well we'll do the report card later

103
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:36,000
but obviously that didn't happen

104
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:40,560
and move the glass fish code

105
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:43,440
all the ris tcks product docs um

106
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:45,120
process for creating new new specs and

107
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,959
evolving the existing specs create a

108
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,080
compatibility process yada yada yada

109
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:49,920
yada

110
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,440
and then of course the thing from oracle

111
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,119
we're still your vendor of choice

112
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,480
we still love you we will still support

113
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,920
you

114
00:03:54,480 --> 00:04:00,879
um and then so some additional details

115
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:02,159
so release oracle java e8 and glass fish

116
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:04,560
five technologies

117
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:05,840
move it over to eclipse ri's tcks and

118
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,080
product docs

119
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,959
build a compatible ee for jake um

120
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:13,439
implementation

121
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:16,079
that passes um the existing java e tcks

122
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:17,918
use the existing java x package names

123
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:20,400
and component specification names for

124
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:22,079
existing jsrs for continuity

125
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:24,239
define a process by which we can move

126
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:26,400
stuffs forward recruit

127
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,960
community and developers so get get more

128
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:31,120
people involved in all of this

129
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,719
evolve the platform and potentially

130
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,160
incorporate eclipse microprofile

131
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,840
technologies so i'm not going to be

132
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,320
talking about much about microprofile in

133
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,758
this

134
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:40,400
but if you want to ask me questions

135
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:42,720
about it afterwards i'm happy to

136
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,400
and then get this done as quickly as

137
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,560
possible

138
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,000
all right so before we kind of go into

139
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,759
um

140
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,520
you know what or how we actually

141
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:54,560
executed this whole move and what we

142
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,560
came up with in the end

143
00:04:54,639 --> 00:05:01,120
it's important to sort of reflect on

144
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,919
how how was the java e java ee ecosystem

145
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,199
managed

146
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:07,198
um so basically there's this complex web

147
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:10,479
of intellectual property

148
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:13,759
dials and knobs that companies use to

149
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:15,758
control platforms um these slides were

150
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:18,000
if you ever if you if you're a foster

151
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:18,880
fan these slides are clipped out of a

152
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,840
talk that i did

153
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:24,719
in the legal dev room back in 2017

154
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:27,039
called corporate shenanigans

155
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,000
and so if you want to take a look at

156
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:30,800
that you can

157
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,280
but basically you've got you know code

158
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,000
which is

159
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:35,440
what most people in this room care about

160
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,680
but then there's patents that have

161
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:39,440
things to do there's specifications

162
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,720
trademarks and certifications and every

163
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:44,000
one of these

164
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:45,600
provides companies with dials and knobs

165
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,520
that they can use to control things so

166
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:50,560
of course source code as we know

167
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:54,960
is free and easy to get because

168
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:56,639
java ee was and is open source

169
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,080
so the source code was under maintained

170
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:02,160
under the glass fish project

171
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:05,359
which was dual license cdl and gpl plus

172
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,960
class path exception so gp alpha's class

173
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,919
path is a sure a license most of you are

174
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,400
familiar with

175
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:12,000
cddl is what's commonly referred to as a

176
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:15,039
weak copy left license

177
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:18,960
um it's actually very very similar to

178
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:20,960
the epl and in particular the epl 2.0

179
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,638
so one of the things that had to happen

180
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,599
was we re-licensed all the stuff that

181
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:27,039
was cdl

182
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:30,080
plus gpl plus class path to epl

183
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:31,440
plus gpl plus class path that was very

184
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,680
minimal disruption to the community

185
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:35,120
because the cddl and epl licenses are

186
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,199
very very similar

187
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,120
at least in it they look they read very

188
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:40,400
differently but the legal effect is very

189
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,759
similar

190
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:45,120
and of course glass fish like open jdk

191
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:47,039
if you want to contribute you have to

192
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,759
sign the oca

193
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:50,400
the specifications was cr managed by the

194
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:51,680
jcp

195
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,520
i'm sure many people here are familiar

196
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,960
with the jcp it's not

197
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:57,039
an independent vendor-neutral

198
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:59,680
organization it's uh it's run by as a

199
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:02,719
division of oracle

200
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:04,160
and then each spec or each jsr would

201
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,360
probably be more precise has to provide

202
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,440
a spec document

203
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:11,360
a reference implementation a tck and

204
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:11,360
each one of those has their own license

205
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:16,720
if you want to get the tck this isn't

206
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,960
java ee i'm actually not sure how it

207
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,720
works in javascript

208
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,239
um you have to sign a non-disclosure

209
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,120
with oracle just to see a copy of the

210
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:27,039
agreement

211
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:30,560
um and of course the tck itself

212
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:31,599
is confidential so that's makes it hard

213
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,880
to exchange

214
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:36,000
exchange views and and results

215
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,080
patents are pooled during the

216
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,080
specification process at the jcp and

217
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:42,159
arguably that's still the major

218
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:44,240
value of the jcp that still exists is

219
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,440
that multiple vendors sit around a table

220
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,360
and because of their participation of

221
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,960
the jcp then there's multiple

222
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,800
the patent portfolios of multiple

223
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:53,198
companies

224
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:56,560
are helping protect the consumers and

225
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:59,440
adopters of this technology

226
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:01,039
the license to the tck is very long and

227
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,479
complicated and it's not necessarily

228
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:05,280
written to help you

229
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:06,318
um and can and does usually cost money

230
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,239
um

231
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,759
and the way that the patents flow is you

232
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,479
get a license to the patents once you

233
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:14,800
fully pass the tck

234
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:17,440
the license to the javi trademark also

235
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:20,560
is not necessarily written in your favor

236
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:22,319
and can be expensive

237
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,560
all right so that's kind of sort of a

238
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:27,520
synopsis of the way the java ee

239
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:30,639
ecosystem worked

240
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:31,280
so what did we do so it's important to

241
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:35,440
remember

242
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:35,439
that in october of 2017

243
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:40,320
the eclipse foundation itself was an

244
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,360
open source foundation

245
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:46,880
we did not have a spec process

246
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:48,680
like it just didn't exist uh we

247
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:50,240
and so one of the common

248
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:53,199
misunderstandings that

249
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:55,120
open source people have is that they

250
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:58,560
think that open source licenses and and

251
00:08:55,120 --> 00:09:00,800
can basically completely replace specs

252
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:02,399
and spec licenses and that's actually

253
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,920
not true

254
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:05,440
the main difference is when you

255
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:07,519
contribute to an open source

256
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,800
project your contributions if there's

257
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:10,320
any patents that read on your

258
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:13,680
contributions

259
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:16,480
they those patent licenses only flow to

260
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:18,160
people who derive their code from that

261
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,560
code

262
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:22,000
whereas specifications are documents

263
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,439
which where this patents

264
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
anybody who does an independent

265
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:28,240
implementation of that spec

266
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,120
gets a license to the patents even

267
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,760
though they didn't

268
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,279
use your particular contributions the

269
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:35,200
other main difference is that when you

270
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:37,200
contribute to an open source license

271
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,240
any patents that your company may be

272
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,480
contributing

273
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:42,160
are scoped just to that contribution or

274
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,920
the combination of that contribution

275
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:46,000
with the larger body at the moment that

276
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:49,199
you make the contribution

277
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,839
whereas in specs the patent licenses are

278
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,240
to every patent that your company owns

279
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:55,680
that

280
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:59,120
might read on the implementation so

281
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:02,000
um so the patent the patent differences

282
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:04,000
between what you have in open source

283
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,279
versus a well-run spec process are

284
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,839
completely different

285
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:09,279
and we didn't even like we hadn't even

286
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:11,200
started really thinking about what it

287
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:12,480
would be to do this and it turned out

288
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,640
the lawyers at the time said it's going

289
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,959
to take you a year and i'm like

290
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:19,120
no it was probably over a year by the

291
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:21,040
time we were done

292
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,480
in there was like transfer all of glass

293
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,000
fish

294
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,440
of course as part of that all the

295
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,800
trademarks were glass fish we had to do

296
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,160
all the code and ip review do the

297
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:31,279
re-licensing

298
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:32,880
and um we had to build a massive build

299
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:34,720
farm for glass fish because they had

300
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,839
this sort of workflow where they'd make

301
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,240
a change

302
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:39,600
um and kick off a build right away and

303
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,279
they needed to have a completely

304
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,600
functioning binary pop out the other

305
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:45,200
side and you know a couple of hours

306
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,360
i think the first time we did it it ran

307
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,880
for 48 hours and failed

308
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:51,519
so you know you know you've all done

309
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:54,240
this it's just it's just work right

310
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:54,959
um create a new brand um we came up with

311
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,120
this

312
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:59,839
beautiful little sailing ship and that's

313
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:03,600
so the jakarta ee brand

314
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:06,160
and to come to

315
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:09,440
replace the the jcp the coffee cup that

316
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:11,519
said java ee underneath it

317
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:13,360
and originally the intent was that the

318
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:14,079
new spec process was going to allow us

319
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:17,519
to evolve

320
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:18,959
the java x name space and that

321
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:20,800
didn't work out there's a couple of

322
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:23,839
reasons why that didn't work out

323
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:26,279
one is java x if oracle says that

324
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:28,000
the namespace java x is a oracle

325
00:11:26,279 --> 00:11:29,839
trademark um

326
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,279
just editorial comment i've never met a

327
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:34,160
lawyer that doesn't work for oracle that

328
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:36,880
thinks you can trademark a namespace

329
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,519
but they they insist that they can so

330
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:40,399
we're not gonna

331
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:41,600
argue with them so they have because in

332
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,079
trademarks they have a lot of quality

333
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,079
control

334
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:46,479
so if we wanted to evolve java x oracle

335
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:48,319
would get to do a lot of quality

336
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,720
quality inspection on everything that

337
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,600
came out of a supposedly vendor-neutral

338
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,519
spec process

339
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:57,680
so it didn't work out and then create

340
00:11:53,519 --> 00:12:00,079
the new branding program

341
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:01,760
um so just in some numbers we brought on

342
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:03,519
actually ended up being more than 39 but

343
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:05,200
call it roughly 40 new open source

344
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:08,320
projects at the eclipse foundation

345
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:10,320
onboarded 160 new committers

346
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:13,360
put up about hundred git repositories

347
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:15,680
and did a lot of build pipelines

348
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,800
um but the one of the things that

349
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:21,519
happened uh

350
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:23,199
proven i think really early in 2019

351
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:24,800
that was actually super important and i

352
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,560
think gets under

353
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:29,680
very much underestimated by a lot of

354
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:32,239
people is that all of the java ee

355
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:34,560
tcks are now completely open source so

356
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:36,560
the entire java ee

357
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:38,800
tck is licensed under the eclipse public

358
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:40,000
license 2.0 plus gpl with cloth pass

359
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,079
exception

360
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,920
which means that we have complete

361
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:45,279
transparency over the evolution of the

362
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:48,560
tck

363
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:51,760
all challenges to the tcks are just bugs

364
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:53,760
contributions to the tcks are welcome

365
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,800
so we've greatly increased the pool of

366
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,480
contributors

367
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:59,040
and one of the things that uh that's

368
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,440
super important is that the tck license

369
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,920
that

370
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:03,680
the the eclipse foundation tck license

371
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:06,719
that this operates under

372
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:08,719
um it's on our website you can read it

373
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,920
and one of the things that it says is

374
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:12,480
that

375
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:13,680
you can ex make explicit claims of

376
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,680
compatibility

377
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:18,160
if you pass these tests even if you

378
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:20,399
don't want to license the mark

379
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:21,680
so if you have a something that passed

380
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:23,279
all the tests you can say we're

381
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:25,519
compatible

382
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:26,399
and but and that's perfectly okay you

383
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:28,000
just um

384
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:29,440
if you actually want to put the sailing

385
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,959
ship on your product

386
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:33,120
um the requirement is that you have to

387
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:34,479
become a member of the jakarta ee

388
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,760
working group which to put that into

389
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,519
perspective for

390
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,880
a small startup with fewer than 10

391
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:40,399
people will cost you three thousand

392
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,880
dollars a year

393
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:45,040
um and you can actually even if you're a

394
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,880
huge company you can get the license for

395
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,880
40k a year

396
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:50,320
i can i don't know the exact numbers but

397
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,839
i'm willing to bet a lot of money that

398
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,279
that's several orders of magnitude

399
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:56,560
cheaper than the previous

400
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:57,439
licensing um i'm not going to go through

401
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,119
the whole thing here

402
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,639
in terms of the new spec process that we

403
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,079
created um

404
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:04,480
suffice it to say that it has a life

405
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:06,079
cycle um it's in some ways

406
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:08,079
it's basically the union of the best

407
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:09,680
ideas that we got from the jcp plus the

408
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:11,279
best ideas that we have from the eclipse

409
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:15,120
development process

410
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:17,680
everything is open source by default um

411
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,639
and uh and then we so we expect all

412
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,560
things to move

413
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:22,480
forward openly and transparently through

414
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:26,000
the entire life cycle

415
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:29,199
so just to compare um so how we do

416
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,399
uh sort of the jcp versus the jakarta

417
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:32,399
spec process

418
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:33,519
it's uh in the java ee world this is i

419
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:35,360
don't think this this is certainly not

420
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:37,040
true anymore in the java essie world

421
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,800
because of japs and the in the way that

422
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,079
things flow out of open jdk

423
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,839
but i think it's fair to say that in the

424
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:44,880
java ee world there's there was

425
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:48,240
um a history where a lot of times

426
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:49,680
um things got done first in specs um

427
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,279
historic particularly historically and

428
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:53,120
then they try out implementations that's

429
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:54,880
how you end up with abominations like

430
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:58,320
being managed persistence

431
00:14:54,880 --> 00:15:00,560
um and uh the way that we have uh the

432
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,600
the approach that we have in jakarta e

433
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,439
is

434
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,959
very specifically everything is code

435
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,160
first and then you spec later and in

436
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:08,399
particular

437
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:10,639
um it's actually written into the into

438
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:12,800
the process that we won't accept a new

439
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:14,800
proposal for a spec if there's not

440
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:16,560
some open source implementation out

441
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,000
there somewhere

442
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,760
so the two things that we're looking for

443
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,240
is a demonstration that something can

444
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:24,000
that does this can be built and the

445
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:26,000
second is that there's some indication

446
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,440
that the world gives a

447
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,959
um because if you build a bunch of

448
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,639
software and nobody cares why do you

449
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:34,560
need a spec

450
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:36,399
so that's what we mean by code first

451
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:38,000
in the jcp there's this strong notion of

452
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:39,839
a spec lead

453
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,000
to the degree that in many cases the

454
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:43,759
spec lead controlled the pen

455
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,360
um everything that we do at eclipse is

456
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:47,680
collaborative by nature

457
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:49,279
and i guarantee you as we start moving

458
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,638
forward with some of these specs we're

459
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:52,880
going to have some enormous

460
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:54,560
bun fights on the mailing lists because

461
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,120
instead of having some strong spec lead

462
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:57,439
saying no

463
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,959
this is the way it's going to be all the

464
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,079
boys and girls involved are actually

465
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:01,920
going to have to

466
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:03,120
negotiate with one another and come up

467
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:05,199
with uh how the spec

468
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,399
is going to evolve so collaborative is

469
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:08,719
is important

470
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:10,399
especially open collaboration uh but it

471
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,320
does it can and i

472
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:13,600
predict that it will lead to some more

473
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:16,880
conflict

474
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:19,600
um documents and tcks are open source

475
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:21,279
so everything all the artifacts um the

476
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,320
the middle uh particular particularly

477
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:24,000
the work in progress

478
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:26,240
are all completely available under open

479
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,160
source licenses

480
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:30,240
rather than having this notion of one

481
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:33,040
normative reference implementation

482
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:34,480
before you can declare a spec final you

483
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:36,800
have to have at least

484
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:39,600
one compatible implementation and

485
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:42,240
compatible implementation is defined as

486
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:44,160
it has to pass the tck and it has to be

487
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:46,079
available under an open source license

488
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:49,680
where the open source licenses are

489
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:50,479
epl apache or bsd so as long as you have

490
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,560
a

491
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:54,639
fairly liberally licensed open source

492
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:56,000
implementation that passes the tck you

493
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:58,880
can declare the spec final

494
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:01,600
but it's not normative in the sense that

495
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:03,680
if you it doesn't resolve disputes

496
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,160
and this this process of doing

497
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,799
certification itself is

498
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:08,799
self-certification and you have to

499
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:11,679
maintain records to demonstrate that you

500
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:14,319
pass all the tests

501
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:15,520
um in the interest of time i'll probably

502
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:18,159
whip through this pretty

503
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:20,240
basically you end up imagine a world

504
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:22,079
where you develop specs entirely under

505
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:24,319
open source licenses and then you're

506
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:26,240
done remember i was talking about those

507
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:26,959
funky patent grants that happen in spec

508
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,079
processes

509
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:30,000
that are different than open source

510
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:32,879
licenses so when you're

511
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,480
done we re-license the artifacts under

512
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,160
different licenses so the document

513
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:39,520
itself becomes

514
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:40,559
published under a very liberal copyright

515
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:43,600
license

516
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:45,440
that's based on the w3c spec license

517
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:47,439
so it's a copyright license that says go

518
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:49,840
ahead and implement this in software

519
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,559
you know you're free to do that then the

520
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,399
um

521
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:53,840
there's an api that exists that's under

522
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,240
well it says eclipse public license here

523
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,918
but if

524
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:58,240
we do have a couple of specs that are

525
00:17:55,919 --> 00:18:00,000
under apache so it would be under that

526
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:02,400
the tck license i talked a little bit

527
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,559
about before it's a binary license so

528
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,400
there's one particular binary

529
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:08,639
that's derived from the open source code

530
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:10,559
that's under this and you have to pass

531
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:12,960
that version of the tck to claim

532
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:14,399
compatibility

533
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,000
and then as i said the compatible

534
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:18,080
implementations have to be

535
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,520
um under an open source license and

536
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:21,600
there's a there's a choice of three at

537
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:24,160
the moment

538
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,959
um and then compatible implementations

539
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:29,200
come from that

540
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:32,400
and we're really happy that

541
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:35,360
when we shipped our first jakarta ee

542
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:36,559
8 specification which is basically a

543
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,799
copy and paste of the

544
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:40,559
java ee8 specification but under the new

545
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:42,080
licensing regime

546
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:44,240
we got a bunch of compatible

547
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,879
implementations um put out into the

548
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:49,120
marketplace

549
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:51,039
really quickly um so we're up to um

550
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:52,559
uh four different vendors uh eclipse

551
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:53,120
foundation with glassfish being one of

552
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:56,080
them

553
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:57,918
open liberty paera and wildfly from from

554
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:59,439
red hat and

555
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:01,440
oracle has made announcements that web

556
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:04,320
logic is going to be coming sometime i

557
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,320
think in q1

558
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,480
all right big bang so because we

559
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,320
couldn't agree on the on

560
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:12,880
being able to modify the java x name

561
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:15,200
space we get to break compatibility

562
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,240
um so everything that you used to know

563
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:19,120
is you know

564
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:22,080
java x dot servlet dot yadda yadda yadda

565
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:24,080
is now going to be jakarta.servlet.yada

566
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:25,678
yada

567
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:27,120
and there are there's work that's going

568
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:30,400
in to build open source

569
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:34,000
uh tools to help with the transition um

570
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:34,720
but we're gonna have um there is going

571
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,160
to be

572
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:40,000
a one-time only complete disruption

573
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:41,360
of the technology formerly known as java

574
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,880
ee

575
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:48,159
and this was and there was

576
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:50,799
it was a great community moment

577
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:52,080
to watch the amount of discussion that

578
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:53,360
went into making this decision

579
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,039
so if anybody was following those

580
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,559
mailing lists i mean it was it was

581
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:58,080
really good there was a lot of

582
00:19:56,559 --> 00:20:00,480
back and forth but it ended up in a

583
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:02,799
really good place um

584
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:04,559
we're going to get rid of some um cruft

585
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:06,639
so there's some things that have been

586
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:07,600
sitting around in in java e for a long

587
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,200
time

588
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,240
that nobody really cares about anymore

589
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,400
so we're actually going to actually

590
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:15,039
deprecate deprecated specifications

591
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:16,559
um so we have some minor enhancements to

592
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:18,080
some really small number of specs we're

593
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:18,720
really trying to keep that to a minimum

594
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:21,918
for

595
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:25,280
pure backwards compatibility um and

596
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:26,640
so there's no new specs in ee9 but there

597
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:30,000
will be java se

598
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:31,600
11 support um and so

599
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,480
uh we do expect that most vendors will

600
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:37,678
also support java java se8

601
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:40,720
but se11 will be uh will be

602
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:44,000
included so if you go back

603
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:44,400
and look at how we did um actually i'm

604
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,960
sorry

605
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,080
that was really super green at one point

606
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,520
um so

607
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,039
go back to the original thing the

608
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:52,559
original goals that i laid out i think

609
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:54,320
on slide number four

610
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:56,158
so how do we do so we re-licensed

611
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:58,639
everything check

612
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:59,760
uh built a compatible glass fish that

613
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:02,960
passed the gv

614
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:04,960
java ee8 to that check

615
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:06,880
use the existing java x name spaces

616
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:08,960
large fail on that one

617
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,919
define a process to evolve existing

618
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,919
specs we did

619
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:13,679
although under the jaccard jakarta

620
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:15,520
namespace

621
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:16,799
recruit vendors and other community

622
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,320
members actually that's working out

623
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:21,280
really well you can actually watch the

624
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:23,840
community engage and become more active

625
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:25,280
and we're starting to see some some

626
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:28,240
interest from new vendors

627
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:29,678
to participate evolve the platform and

628
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,400
potentially incorporate eclipse micro

629
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:32,240
profile

630
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,520
that's still a work in progress don't

631
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,120
actually i couldn't tell you how that's

632
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:37,039
going to turn out right now

633
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,320
um and the probably one of the biggest

634
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:41,440
fails is this took

635
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:43,760
way longer than anybody wanted it to um

636
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:46,080
so we wanted to be done by the you know

637
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:47,840
originally by the end of 2018 and here

638
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:49,600
we are at the beginning of 2020 and

639
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:52,799
we're still plugging away

640
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:55,439
um the good news is that

641
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:56,480
once we get ee9 out of the door uh we do

642
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,919
expect that there's

643
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:59,520
what sorry what we've explicitly told

644
00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:00,880
the projects is while we're while we're

645
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:04,000
doing ee9

646
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:06,400
if you at the individual spec level

647
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,039
want to branch and do something

648
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:10,080
interesting

649
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:11,039
go ahead and do it so you might actually

650
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:14,480
see

651
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:18,559
new versions of just jax rs or

652
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:20,320
uh jakarta batch or servlet happen

653
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:22,799
in parallel with us actually doing a

654
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:25,439
full platform release

655
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:26,240
and i think that's it thank you hope you

656
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,039
have time for

657
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:29,039
questions a couple

658
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:36,320
any questions

659
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:42,559
oh come on yes

660
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:50,799
absolutely yeah oh sorry

661
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:53,440
thank you repeat the question the

662
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:55,120
question was how was it under sun was it

663
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,559
actually any different than under oracle

664
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,199
and no the all the stuff where i said

665
00:22:56,559 --> 00:23:09,840
oracle

666
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:09,840
was just as true under sun any other yep

667
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:15,039
yeah so ripping so what we have right so

668
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:17,120
sorry

669
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:18,559
thank you repeat the question with in

670
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:21,678
the world of containers do we

671
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:22,320
expect to see the so i'll sort of define

672
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:24,080
it as

673
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:25,840
cutting these large platforms up into

674
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:28,240
smaller stand-alone specifications that

675
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:30,559
can be used independently of one another

676
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,919
absolutely yes that's also the way

677
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:34,158
microprofile works

678
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:35,039
and so we expect to go down that i

679
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:37,120
expect to see the

680
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:38,240
perhaps even additional profiles be

681
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:40,959
created which are

682
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:42,080
targeted um specifically to more modern

683
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:44,000
use cases

684
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:47,199
um all of these things are not only

685
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,200
possible they're probable

686
00:23:48,080 --> 00:24:05,199
one last question charlie

687
00:23:51,120 --> 00:24:07,279
