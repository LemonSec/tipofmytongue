1
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,520
first of all

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:09,920
morning everyone it's audible at the

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:13,120
back am i right

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:16,079
perfect so um hi

5
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:17,600
i'm trishul um i work at clix a company

6
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:18,880
called clicks and i volunteer for

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,520
mozilla

8
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:23,359
and just the way to put it i believe

9
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:25,198
myself as a clock candidate like klix

10
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:27,920
and superman at mozilla

11
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:29,519
so today i'll be talking about

12
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:32,719
progressive web apps

13
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:34,559
how many of you know this term that

14
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:36,160
makes my task really really easy

15
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:37,760
because the next slice i can just really

16
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:40,879
skip that

17
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:42,640
so what is a pwa

18
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:44,640
it's a common run between website and

19
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,800
native app

20
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:50,320
it has discovered uh discoverability of

21
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,320
web and retention of an app

22
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,480
so how many of you know alex resells by

23
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:58,000
any chance

24
00:00:54,480 --> 00:01:00,078
okay so he's a guy who said

25
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,079
they are just the website that took all

26
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:03,520
the right vitamins

27
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:05,600
how many of you agree on this statement

28
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:08,320
on with me

29
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:10,960
okay let's see the hand count and let's

30
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:14,080
um talk after this stuff

31
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:15,039
why are we talking about pwa it's

32
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:18,320
installable

33
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:23,280
how many of you agree with that

34
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:24,559
perfect works offline faster load time

35
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,759
this is a crucial one how many of you

36
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:30,000
agree on this they're faster load times

37
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:31,759
cool push notifications i know everyone

38
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,960
is annoyed everyone is annoyed how many

39
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:35,280
of you are really annoyed by push

40
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:38,720
notifications

41
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,720
okay we are on the same page then

42
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,040
all in all an app like experience via

43
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,360
web

44
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:47,119
so a typical pwa looks like this

45
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,720
whenever you visit a website

46
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:50,960
it gives you a notification like hey do

47
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,840
you want to install this one

48
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,000
when you install it gets an icon like

49
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:57,119
that

50
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,079
if um this is the icon just in case it's

51
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:01,119
a

52
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:04,559
simple app then it has a splash screen

53
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:08,959
and finally finally the app

54
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:12,239
so this is what a pwa looks like

55
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:15,760
how to create a pwa

56
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:16,480
a simple web app manifest so the first

57
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,560
part

58
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,560
basically tells where the manifest is

59
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,560
and the second part what manifest is

60
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,840
it's just a json file which has kind of

61
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,520
metadata about your app

62
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,680
like your name short name the color

63
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,360
theme the icon on the splash screen

64
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:32,879
something like that

65
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:36,239
and i believe like uh this is a

66
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:38,399
common knowledge by now many of you know

67
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:41,519
service workers

68
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:44,239
it's getting easier so i believe service

69
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:46,160
workers are building block of pwa

70
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:47,920
so it provides features like offline

71
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:52,239
caching

72
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:55,359
push notifications so

73
00:02:52,239 --> 00:03:00,560
the title of my talk is pwa on steroids

74
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:04,239
right but this is all about pwa

75
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:08,400
the question is where are the steroids

76
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:08,400
what are steroids any guesses

77
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:13,040
anyone i know it's early morning 10

78
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,519
o'clock so

79
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:18,480
still here's the thing like um i am just

80
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:21,120
engaging so that i don't sleep

81
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,119
so anyone

82
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:33,839
kind of that's the right

83
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:33,840
anyone else multi-platform

84
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,840
okay

85
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:55,519
performance enhancement so this is

86
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,200
really interesting because i got lots of

87
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:57,599
new ideas now because my idea was very

88
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,319
very

89
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:01,200
very very small very very narrow and i

90
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:04,480
just keep it

91
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:07,359
to browser apis so

92
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,319
the modern browser apis gives the power

93
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,920
to javascript

94
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:14,399
to interact with the device features

95
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:16,560
that this led javascript to go beyond

96
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:19,840
the browser

97
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:21,759
to make more app-like features to start

98
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,880
with

99
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:26,479
we have something called a speech

100
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:28,880
synthesis how many have used this one

101
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:31,280
for those who have not used let's try to

102
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:36,159
use it if my browser allows me

103
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:39,280
okay oops not this one

104
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:43,199
or really i should have put

105
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:46,719
come on

106
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:49,360
um i don't know

107
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,360
if it works

108
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:57,840
mirroring has always been a pain

109
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:57,840
where is it opening anyway really

110
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,639
i cannot see i'm just typing like

111
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:06,240
hopefully it works

112
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:11,840
so let's say um sweet synthesis

113
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:11,840
okay so as simple as

114
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:19,680
it's a normal text-to-speech engine

115
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:22,840
and so

116
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:24,160
maybe my laptop needs a mine good

117
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:26,960
morning

118
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,160
or maybe how i said morning in the

119
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,880
really morning

120
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,240
good morning that's all my mounting

121
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,880
sounds in the morning

122
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,360
i really wish it would be like something

123
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,320
like this

124
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:39,440
good morning but you know how it works

125
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:42,400
so

126
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:44,000
looking at this this is the line of code

127
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:47,440
these are the lines of code

128
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,520
which i used to make that just

129
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,880
look at the code for a while that's the

130
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,400
beauty of javascript you know

131
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:55,280
like the developers have done enough

132
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:58,318
work to expose that api

133
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:59,758
which you can use for five lines and you

134
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:00,639
can generate an output like that which i

135
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,120
did

136
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:04,800
so the first thing we have to get a

137
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,560
space synthesis object

138
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,400
and this is like kind of not mandatory

139
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,960
like um this gives the voices from your

140
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,479
browser

141
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,638
else it will default to whatever your

142
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:15,280
language of your browser is

143
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:16,720
then we create this speech synthesis is

144
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,719
a trends

145
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:20,400
and we pass the text the actual text

146
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,479
which you type or which we read

147
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,758
kind of screen reader or something and

148
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:25,359
these are the settings which i can do

149
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:28,160
which are not mandatory

150
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,960
and then all you have to do is very very

151
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:32,319
um

152
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:33,039
obvious thing speak so that's the line

153
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:36,880
of code

154
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:40,000
which i wrote for that experience

155
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:43,120
okay so let's do the reverse of this

156
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,520
speech recognition so

157
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,520
let's say

158
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,800
so before this i'll give you a

159
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:51,680
disclaimer this talk will be lots of

160
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,080
demos

161
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,759
and whoever has attended a talk before

162
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,199
or spoke anywhere

163
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:59,360
you know the probability of success of

164
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:02,400
the demos in live talk

165
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:05,360
right so please spare me please

166
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:07,440
believe in me and let's keep our fingers

167
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:11,919
crossed the demos work

168
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:16,479
to start with let's try this

169
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:20,479
oh really yeah

170
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:25,520
good morning nope

171
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:25,520
good morning okay it's working

172
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:32,318
okay time to turn off

173
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:36,639
sorry

174
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:42,160
it's getting really really literal so

175
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:44,318
the point is like

176
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,199
this is right in my browser i have no

177
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:47,919
text um

178
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:49,360
speech to text engine there this this

179
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:50,479
string has been originated from my

180
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:54,400
browser

181
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:56,800
and before i say something

182
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,679
um please get a kind of acquainted with

183
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,360
my laziness

184
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,120
so if i do something i really don't want

185
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,879
to write a code for that

186
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,319
i i want to write like five line 10 line

187
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:06,319
not more than that so

188
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:08,560
in the same case i wrote few lines with

189
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:11,759
that all i need to do is

190
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,639
have this with webkit speech recognition

191
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:14,879
and

192
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:16,479
we have some functions like um on start

193
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:18,080
when someone starts speaking when the

194
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:21,039
micro microphone get the

195
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:22,080
audio from somewhere on error on end on

196
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:24,878
result

197
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:26,159
and recognition dot start so this

198
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,319
function is really interesting

199
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:30,800
on result so if you have looked at the

200
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:33,120
example what it did it typed something

201
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:35,680
and then it tried to rectify that to

202
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:38,080
make more uh legible string out of it

203
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:40,159
so this functions basically has

204
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:43,599
something called as s final

205
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:46,480
so this function what it does is the

206
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:47,279
uh the parameter which it gets is called

207
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,760
result

208
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:51,519
and is final so without the spinal it

209
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:53,760
still tries to make sense out of it

210
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:55,440
so it shows interim results and then

211
00:08:53,760 --> 00:09:00,160
when is final is true

212
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:01,920
it shows the final result okay so

213
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:03,439
how many are still on this like this

214
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:06,399
makes sense to your speech recognition

215
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,399
speech synthesis

216
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,839
do you think of any usability in your

217
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,680
app which you can provide with these

218
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:14,959
things

219
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:19,760
how many on on that okay

220
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:23,279
we are getting there media capture api

221
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:27,200
how many of you know that okay

222
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:29,760
so let's uh put it very simple um

223
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,959
it captures the media of your laptop or

224
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,880
system whatever it is

225
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:34,560
in our case let's um have a quick

226
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:37,600
example

227
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:41,439
if it works

228
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:43,440
media capture api so

229
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,800
so don't judge me on my ui because i'm

230
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,839
really bad at that

231
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:49,279
so i just want the work to be done so

232
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:53,680
it's a simple

233
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:55,519
app which kind of takes my camera input

234
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:57,120
i'm really sorry for you guys because

235
00:09:55,519 --> 00:10:00,240
you have to see two of me i know

236
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:02,640
how i look so so kind of

237
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,680
so i just created a very small app what

238
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:07,360
i do i um

239
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:10,160
just take a pic of me it works

240
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:12,000
and the these are the like simple css

241
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:15,680
filters which i can apply

242
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:18,320
maybe like this or or maybe just blur it

243
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,719
and then go to the normal win so once

244
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,720
this

245
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,640
the right side is the canvas element and

246
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,240
you know how how much magic can be done

247
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:29,360
with the canvas elements

248
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:29,360
right so again for this

249
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:33,359
there's a small piece of code which i

250
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:36,479
made

251
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,600
so this basically gets the user media

252
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,079
which is from my device

253
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,360
and i can i can define i want video

254
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:42,880
audio or whatever i want

255
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,200
so in this case i just wanted video i

256
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:46,480
said video true and my stream object has

257
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:49,440
the video of me

258
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,320
and via that i can capture the element

259
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:56,160
and

260
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:56,160
put it on the canvas okay okay next one

261
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,519
how many of you know this device

262
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:02,480
orientation

263
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:03,839
okay how many of you played temple run

264
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:07,360
it's old i know

265
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:10,240
so um so

266
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:11,519
what happens is like um with this api we

267
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:15,200
get a three dimension

268
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:17,920
three dimension position of our device

269
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,720
in this case specifically mobile so you

270
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,640
know like this is

271
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,399
um what why i feel this is interesting

272
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:24,240
because this is another way to have a

273
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:26,480
user input

274
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:28,160
right rather than just having like type

275
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:31,040
something or speak something

276
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:32,560
this is very getting very physical like

277
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,680
for example temple run i really like

278
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,439
that game because in that

279
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:37,120
i was engaged rather than putting left

280
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,279
right swipe

281
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,320
right so this give me another dimension

282
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:42,640
where i can

283
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:45,360
um use the javascript to give a better

284
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:48,079
user experience to my user

285
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:50,000
so um i'll give another try i will try

286
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:53,120
to

287
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:57,600
connect my phone to my laptop and see if

288
00:11:53,120 --> 00:12:00,399
that works again

289
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,399
is it working

290
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:13,440
okay it works so um

291
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:17,279
no thanks please um let's go for

292
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,279
device orientation okay

293
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:22,079
so this is my masterpiece of ui so

294
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:24,319
please don't judge me on that

295
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:26,399
so this give this ball gives me exact

296
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,079
position where my mobile is in the 3d

297
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:29,760
dimension

298
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:33,760
and accordingly i can take the user

299
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:33,760
input or whatever i want to do

300
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:43,120
please don't judge

301
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:45,680
okay moving back to our slide

302
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:47,279
all i need to do is to listen to this

303
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:50,160
even device orientation

304
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:51,200
and it gives me three dimensions x y z z

305
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,800
is

306
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:55,040
can you read that or if i'll read that

307
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,000
for you so z line gives the rotation

308
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,959
around z axis

309
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,399
obviously x give you like left to right

310
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:04,160
how my mobile is moving

311
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:07,279
and y gives the front and back okay

312
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:09,839
so let's move to the next one web share

313
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:11,680
api how many of you know this

314
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:13,839
how many have irritated like in your in

315
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,800
your um app in your like let's say any

316
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:16,160
website

317
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,599
if you want to share anything your data

318
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,719
you have to write the url and give a

319
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,360
copy feature

320
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,800
so that you can just copy it to and copy

321
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,360
to the clipboard and user has to paste

322
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:28,719
in its whatever social media

323
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:31,920
how many of you face this problem

324
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:35,839
right so in modern browsers

325
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:35,839
this can be solved like

326
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:41,600
this oh i'm using that true

327
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:49,279
did it work sure oh come on now sorry

328
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:52,720
for that okay so

329
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:53,760
um let's type something like hey share

330
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,959
it first

331
00:13:53,760 --> 00:14:00,079
first them i'm out of time

332
00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:03,040
okay i heard the alarm so i thought

333
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:04,560
okay so all i need to do is share and it

334
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:07,680
opens my native

335
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:09,599
then it opens my native browser uh

336
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:12,880
native browser and please don't look at

337
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:16,880
my contacts i should have turned it off

338
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:20,639
and i can pass the text to my gym

339
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:23,920
really everything right now okay cool

340
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:27,040
taken so i

341
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:31,839
did this just from my web app

342
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:35,439
the native share right to my gmail

343
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:38,000
so i love this api for a single reason

344
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:39,279
um this is one of the simplest api like

345
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:45,079
pretty straightforward

346
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:47,680
if you look at the code of this

347
00:14:45,079 --> 00:14:48,079
navigator.share the title you want to

348
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,160
share

349
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:52,000
the text you want to share the url you

350
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:55,439
want to share that's it

351
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:57,839
including this will create that native

352
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:59,120
search for you

353
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:01,199
many of you want to implement this in

354
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:04,480
your app

355
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:09,519
perfect we are going there cool

356
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:12,880
okay how many of you know this api

357
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:14,320
amazing amazing so till now for every

358
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:16,480
api i have a demo

359
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:20,320
and i have a demo for this too but the

360
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:23,199
breakage chances of this is 95 percent

361
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,680
so please don't judge me on this api

362
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:25,120
because

363
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,719
you know how this works the connection

364
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,440
in the browser in the real time and in

365
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:31,279
live talk

366
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:34,240
okay so um

367
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:37,040
oh i'm still here how many of you want

368
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:37,040
to try this with me

369
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:41,040
not so interesting yeah trust me i'm not

370
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:43,279
that bad you know

371
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,160
okay so here what i have is a bluetooth

372
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:46,800
bulb

373
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,279
okay um what i will do is try to connect

374
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:51,519
this

375
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:55,839
with my browser okay um so i will just

376
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:55,839
turn it turn it on

377
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:03,199
okay hopefully it is on let's check for

378
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:03,199
this

379
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:10,959
let's check out that this kind of bad

380
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:15,599
situation

381
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:15,599
really okay

382
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:23,839
so the better idea is i will do it here

383
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:23,839
and then publish it there maybe

384
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,360
can i share it like

385
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:38,160
this okay so that you can see actually

386
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:40,160
so what i'm trying to do here is

387
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,600
connect this and this detects a

388
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:45,199
bluetooth bulb around

389
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:47,920
i just connect it okay

390
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:48,319
hopefully it's connected okay this turns

391
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,599
blue

392
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:53,040
so that's my indication that it is

393
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:55,279
connected so um

394
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:57,199
okay now it's tricky how to hold both of

395
00:16:55,279 --> 00:17:00,480
things

396
00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:05,839
um okay i'll i will do it more

397
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:05,839
let's quit this

398
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,799
any color choice

399
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:24,559
is this purple yes it is cool

400
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:26,799
so okay um let's do like this um

401
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:28,160
these are individual apis and these are

402
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:30,879
powerful no doubt

403
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:32,559
but the real power of javascript is in

404
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:36,480
clubbing the apis

405
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:39,918
right so what i've done is

406
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:46,160
i wrote some javascript to

407
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:49,280
upload a file and detect the color of it

408
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,280
and turn it in that color

409
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:57,200
make sense

410
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:59,440
[Applause]

411
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:01,200
since my demos are working i'm getting a

412
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:04,559
bit more ambitious

413
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:05,919
and and if okay

414
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:07,360
let's put it like this if it fails in

415
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:09,919
further please don't judge me just me on

416
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:14,240
the previous contents okay

417
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:19,360
so okay let's try this remember this api

418
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:22,160
okay so i'll again turn it on and

419
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:25,120
let's i'll just put it here so that

420
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,120
everyone can see it

421
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:29,840
oh it's interesting i'll just keep it

422
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,840
down

423
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:46,720
the problem is okay

424
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:49,120
it's red so

425
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,080
that's what i want to convey to you

426
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,760
people right

427
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:54,000
like i can give you the knowledge of

428
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,879
apis like these apis exist these apis

429
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,200
work like this

430
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,400
but this combinations combination is to

431
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,559
us on our

432
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,919
javascript developing things right like

433
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:02,399
these are the dimensions which you can

434
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:05,200
use

435
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,480
you can combine the apis and do amazing

436
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:09,360
stuff

437
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:11,200
okay so five minutes are left it's for

438
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:13,760
with question answers or without

439
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:15,280
with question answers so okay i i had

440
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:18,879
some more demos but um

441
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:22,639
i think we are not permitted with time

442
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:26,240
so for that all i have to do is

443
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,880
um first find the device and here what i

444
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,400
do is like

445
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,000
just give the device name or the service

446
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,720
which i want to use so that i will

447
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,760
narrow down

448
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:35,840
if you see in my um bluetooth list not

449
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:37,520
all elements are not all the bluetooth

450
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:39,120
devices were discovered for example lots

451
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,559
of mobile will be having bluetooth my

452
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:42,479
laptop will be having bluetooth

453
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:44,000
only the one which i wanted so i can

454
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,280
bound it which device which kind of

455
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,520
devices i want to look

456
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,320
okay then there's something called as

457
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,400
gat

458
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:52,559
um i'm not sure if that time is enough

459
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:54,880
for that probably um i

460
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:56,160
will be outside to explain more on this

461
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,360
so i want to

462
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,440
make you understand two things one is

463
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,719
service one is characteristics so

464
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:02,640
service is basically what kind of

465
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:05,600
service i'm giving like for example bulb

466
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:07,280
is um light service or battery service

467
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:10,959
is like for example um this

468
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:11,440
example was from um uh what's that like

469
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,200
um

470
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,559
heart rate monitor a bluetooth heart

471
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,400
rate monitor so

472
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:18,320
i can get the battery service of that

473
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,679
and what characteristic i want is the

474
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:21,678
battery level

475
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:22,799
so this will give me the battery level

476
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:24,320
of that monitor

477
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:26,639
and i can listen to that event something

478
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:27,918
called as characteristic value changed

479
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:30,400
so whenever that battery level will

480
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:34,640
change it will notify the server

481
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:36,880
okay cool

482
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:38,400
here we have some success stories from

483
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:40,400
pwas

484
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:42,240
there are some name some you may know

485
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:45,600
some may you not but i'm sure

486
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:46,880
this i can everyone knows everyone in

487
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:49,439
the room knows right

488
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:51,760
how many of you use twitter pwa by any

489
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,760
chance

490
00:20:53,039 --> 00:21:00,400
if not try it once okay

491
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:03,520
what is the future of pwa

492
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:06,320
it has been around for long right

493
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:08,158
but still very small subset of it is

494
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:10,799
really popular

495
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:10,799
any guesses

496
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:17,840
play store it's on the way

497
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:24,080
exactly more apis better browser support

498
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:26,480
because what i have shown

499
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:28,399
is like may or may not work in every

500
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:31,840
browser

501
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:33,919
right this is the caveat so with better

502
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:35,760
browser support with more apis

503
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:37,039
and the first thing webassembly how many

504
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:38,400
of you know that

505
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:40,879
how many of you are excited about web

506
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,880
assembly

507
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:44,000
that they we can impor uh we put web

508
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:46,158
assembly code

509
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,559
with the pwa things will change

510
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:51,760
drastically

511
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:53,200
here are some references which i use and

512
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:59,840
with that

513
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:59,840
thank you

514
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:08,320
okay so we'll have time for a couple of

515
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:10,080
questions

516
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:12,399
let me just hold it right it's fine we

517
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:14,879
can hold it

518
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,880
yeah sure

519
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:18,960
so who had a question

520
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:28,080
hi thank you for your presentation uh i

521
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,559
have some more questions so do you think

522
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,960
it's a

523
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:31,918
production ready because uh because of

524
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:34,960
um

525
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:37,600
we know that uh only chrome support

526
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:38,559
all these apis for example when i build

527
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:41,600
the app

528
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:43,039
i i can make sure that i use chrome but

529
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:45,520
my client

530
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:47,280
i can use whatever it's true so um

531
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:51,360
implementing any advanced feature

532
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:53,760
how i would do that um i

533
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:55,439
i create two versions of it like i have

534
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:57,200
like for example share api

535
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:59,039
i have both uh both options i will

536
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:01,280
detect if there is navigated dot share

537
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:02,879
i will show just the share button else i

538
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:05,760
would go for the native like how we do

539
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,760
the copy paste thing

540
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,840
so in my very limited experience of

541
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:12,400
using speech synthesis

542
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:13,039
what i learned was that you can get

543
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,720
offline

544
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:16,400
uh when you've turned your phone off a

545
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:19,440
native app will still do speech

546
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:21,360
speech synthesis but the browser won't

547
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,559
um which is frustrating so i also

548
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,879
learned about an api

549
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:25,840
called wake lock which is super bleeding

550
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:28,960
edge

551
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:30,080
true that will be really helpful but the

552
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:33,280
caveat with that

553
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:34,158
is like um the browser tend to stop the

554
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:37,600
camera and

555
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:40,880
um voice when the

556
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:43,360
home screen is locked just to

557
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:44,799
its kind of security feature you can say

558
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,080
but that's a trade-off but that will be

559
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:48,480
really interesting to allow in some

560
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,480
cases

561
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,840
anyone else

562
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:03,840
i uh one more question so what do you

563
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,880
think about react native word because i

564
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:07,678
heard that uh

565
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:09,039
twitter implemented wa with the react

566
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:13,440
native web or something right

567
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:16,480
yep i love that i love that so

568
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:19,440
i i i believe in like idealistic word

569
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:21,200
i never say like um pw will take over

570
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:23,200
everything

571
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:24,400
but there are cases where we don't need

572
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,240
a native app

573
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:27,600
there are cases where we know don't need

574
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:30,000
pwa

575
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:32,480
right so you don't need to create a

576
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,080
native app for everything

577
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,520
lots of cases can be covered with this

578
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,158
for example you are having an e-commerce

579
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:38,639
site

580
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:39,440
you want to create an app for that in no

581
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:42,720
way you need

582
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:44,240
a native app for that so we we have to

583
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,039
live in a like homogeneous world you

584
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:47,039
know

585
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:48,480
so it totally depends on you like what

586
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:50,000
kind of um

587
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:51,760
cost you want to bear what kind of

588
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,159
clients you have

589
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,158
so yeah

590
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:03,840
last question uh yeah

591
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:07,120
how was a share api in the browser

592
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:09,199
sorry in the browser api when you

593
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:10,719
want to search something in the browser

594
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:14,240
in the in desktop

595
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:16,799
how was how looks when you're not sure i

596
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,799
get a question

597
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:31,918
oh no it's uh it's it's not for desktop

598
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:36,158
i mean it will not make sense in desktop

599
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,600
because

600
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:40,840
uh these are extending the native

601
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:42,879
behaviors which is uh constrained to

602
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:54,959
mobile

603
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:54,960
thank you very much thank you everyone
