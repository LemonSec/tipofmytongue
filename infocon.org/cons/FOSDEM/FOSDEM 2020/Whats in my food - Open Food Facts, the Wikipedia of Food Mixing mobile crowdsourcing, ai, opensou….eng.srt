1
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:09,280
good morning everyone

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:11,040
and thank you all for being here uh it's

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:11,678
great to talk at first then so i'm going

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,239
to talk

5
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:15,120
uh to present you today uh open foot

6
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:19,680
fact

7
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:23,359
which is a bit like a wikipedia of food

8
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:25,599
so open food fact

9
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:26,720
is all about this problem that many of

10
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:29,679
us have

11
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,320
in the supermarket about choosing which

12
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:32,960
pack

13
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,680
should i pick for my children so should

14
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,040
i flip

15
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:38,160
over each and every pack and read the

16
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,239
nutrition table

17
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,199
personally i've never managed to

18
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:44,879
understood

19
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:47,039
to understand it it's a lot of figures

20
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:48,718
so you have to do that for each and

21
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:50,399
every single pack

22
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,399
if you want to make an informed choice

23
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:56,399
on food

24
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:59,520
also as you might have heard the impact

25
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:02,719
of food on public health is massive

26
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:06,240
uh it's the third cause um

27
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:09,680
of um of um of uh

28
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:12,560
unwell i mean uh issues with humans

29
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,040
uh it's and it has many preventable

30
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,240
cause

31
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:20,000
many levels that you can uh

32
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:20,000
pull to improve the situation

33
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:27,520
and we wondered if citizens have managed

34
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,520
to create with wikipedia the best

35
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:31,600
encyclopedia in the world

36
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,439
if citizens have managed to create the

37
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:36,720
most accurate map

38
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:37,279
in the world why cannot we why can't we

39
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,560
do it

40
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,840
with food products and that's what

41
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,880
wikipedia

42
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,000
what open food fact is set out to do so

43
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:49,199
we have gathered

44
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,920
1.1 million products from all over the

45
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,960
world

46
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:56,880
so that's the website of open food fact

47
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:58,960
and the intent is to decipher labels

48
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:01,280
which you can also do with the open food

49
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:03,600
fact app the mechanism is simple

50
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,360
you just take a product you look for the

51
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,439
barcode

52
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,919
and you scan it with the app and you

53
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:12,079
will get the valuable information

54
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:14,000
such as the nutriscore about nutritional

55
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:17,280
quality

56
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,800
the nova group which

57
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,040
informs you about the level of

58
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:25,200
transformation of a product

59
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:27,280
and finally in france the carbon impact

60
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,319
which tells you if the product is not

61
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,840
only good for you

62
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:33,920
but also good for the planet and it's

63
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,560
collaborative much like wikipedia

64
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,440
if the product is not there yet you just

65
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,239
take free

66
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,200
photos front ingredient and nutrition

67
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:43,760
and in a minute

68
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:46,160
you can get those scores for any product

69
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:49,280
in the world

70
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:50,959
we also decipher those those e numbers

71
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,239
that you can see on the products those

72
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:56,720
additives

73
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:59,840
uh using fsa data scientific evaluations

74
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:02,879
so you get uh depending on your age

75
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:05,760
the level of overexposure for each and

76
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:08,560
every single additive

77
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,879
you can also compare products when you

78
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,800
are

79
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:12,319
in a store and you don't know which

80
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,720
cereal package you

81
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:15,518
want to pick you can basically with the

82
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,959
app

83
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:21,440
compare many products side to side

84
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:23,519
and make the better choice based on

85
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:26,159
rational factors

86
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:28,239
you can do that of course this is the

87
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:31,280
the photo that you we saw earlier

88
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:33,599
this is this photo as data

89
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,040
so you can basically look at all the

90
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:37,760
breakfast cereals

91
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,200
and pick the right one this is the one i

92
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,760
haven't been eating and this

93
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,399
was the one i've been eating as a child

94
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,159
smacks

95
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,680
you have to imagine that half of the

96
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:49,120
size is pure sugar

97
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:52,000
43 percent of it

98
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,319
of course it's data of public interest

99
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,519
so

100
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:57,920
it has to be open so our data is

101
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:58,879
under the urban database license which

102
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:01,920
requires you

103
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:06,959
to be free for all and all use

104
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:06,958
to attribute and finally to share a like

105
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,159
and we have we've managed to have quite

106
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:14,079
a lot of imp a lot of impact we're a

107
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:16,399
french project but we

108
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:19,600
know the community is uh is

109
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:22,638
international mostly european

110
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:24,400
so we have one million products

111
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:26,720
that have been contributors by

112
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:31,039
contributed by volunteers like you

113
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:32,000
me and producers alike we have 182

114
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,680
countries

115
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,199
where we have products if you're going

116
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,120
to north korea we still

117
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:39,680
have no north korean products in the

118
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,680
database

119
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:45,599
we have 1.5 million uh so far uh users

120
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,799
benefiting from the nutriscore and the

121
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,680
nova

122
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,440
and as it's open as we have an open api

123
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,199
and open data export

124
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:55,040
there are more than 200 apps and

125
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:58,080
services using the data

126
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:59,919
to do various things what's more

127
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:02,960
interesting even to us

128
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:04,000
is uh the scientific paper that use open

129
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:07,359
footfact to make

130
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,520
science progress so uh whenever

131
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,880
where whether they want to study

132
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,400
additives or the impact of

133
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:15,039
transformation of food

134
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,719
that's possible using open data and

135
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:19,520
finally we have 25

136
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:21,520
000 people who have registered uh i mean

137
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:24,000
we don't ask for your personal data

138
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,198
registration is optional but 25 000

139
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,440
people who have decided

140
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:30,400
to sign up and to be an active part of

141
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,400
food transparency

142
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:37,120
and we can do many many things with open

143
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:40,560
data for instance this is santa in italy

144
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:42,880
it has 12 person fruit this

145
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:45,039
is fontaine serbia it has three person

146
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:47,680
fruit

147
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:48,800
this is santa in portugal it has eight

148
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:52,000
person food

149
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:54,960
plus sugar or age high

150
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,919
fructose corn syrup and in irene which

151
00:05:54,960 --> 00:06:00,159
is a french

152
00:05:55,919 --> 00:06:00,159
island it has zero person fruit

153
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:06,400
so that's the kind of thing you can do

154
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:09,280
when you have open data about your food

155
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:10,560
that's another thing in terms of impact

156
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:14,000
you may have heard

157
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:17,600
if you're in a about the nutriscore

158
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,840
that's a picture uh one sorry my clicker

159
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,639
is

160
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:22,479
not responding that's a picture that one

161
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:26,800
of our contributors use

162
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:29,039
did using an image editor

163
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,400
and he put the nutriscore on each every

164
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:33,039
single product

165
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,520
fast forward a couple of years later

166
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:35,840
that's

167
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,880
what we are seeing in french stores it's

168
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:40,239
not only

169
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:41,520
uh it's not uh just applications anymore

170
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,479
it's the real world

171
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:46,159
so you can see nutriscore that is still

172
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:48,880
not compulsory in france

173
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,599
but producers think no think it's good

174
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,919
marketing

175
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:54,240
to display it on their product so this

176
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:58,639
has this shows the kind of impact

177
00:06:54,240 --> 00:07:00,840
uh like open data and apps can have

178
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:02,160
our source are still citizen

179
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:04,560
crowdsourcing

180
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,440
of course so using the app you can

181
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,360
basically

182
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:09,039
create data the third-party apps that

183
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:12,319
also uh

184
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:16,400
bring data but no producers are

185
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:16,400
taking note and providing data as well

186
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,599
so you might recognize some of those

187
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,759
brands

188
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:23,360
many of them are french but they are

189
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:24,400
beginning to have some international

190
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:28,080
ones

191
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:30,719
and we want to help manufacturers

192
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,359
make healthy the better the default

193
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,000
choice

194
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:36,000
just like a computer we want uh the

195
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,240
default choice to be healthier

196
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,400
and that's why we're providing thanks to

197
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,319
the french

198
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:45,359
prevention organism the friend the

199
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:48,879
national french santa public organism

200
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:50,639
we are making a platform for them to

201
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:52,720
find opportunities to improve their

202
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:56,160
products so for instance

203
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:58,319
if they have a brief preparation

204
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,759
they can find opportunities uh to

205
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:03,120
improve the nutriscore

206
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:05,599
or to reduce fat things that are uh

207
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,639
possible to do for them without altering

208
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:09,039
too much the taste

209
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:12,720
and that can uh benefit everyone even

210
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:15,120
people who are not using open food facts

211
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,919
and we are trying to extend the the

212
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,400
impact

213
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:20,639
beyond food we have started to do

214
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:23,440
cosmetics with open beauty facts

215
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:25,440
so same pre simple you scan a barcode

216
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,319
you have those latin ingredients i don't

217
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,800
know if you've tried

218
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:30,080
reading your bottle of shampoo but you

219
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:33,120
can't basically understand

220
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,679
what's on it so we tried to decipher all

221
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,880
that

222
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:39,199
to detect 17 problematic substances

223
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:41,039
and show them to you in the open beauty

224
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,279
fact app

225
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:44,959
so great that's very cool how can i

226
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:47,680
contribute

227
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:48,239
the thing is as you've seen you can have

228
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:51,199
impact

229
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,839
for all people who are blind for

230
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,640
instance

231
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:56,080
can't see the labels so being able to

232
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:58,800
read the labels

233
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:00,560
without having uh in full autonomy is

234
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,279
important that's the kind of impact you

235
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,199
can have

236
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:05,120
by contributing to open food facts and

237
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,760
we are we're not focused on france or

238
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,760
belgium

239
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:09,360
we want to have this impact on the whole

240
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:11,680
world so basically

241
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,680
this is a photo in vietnam you see they

242
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:16,800
have a large grocery

243
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:17,599
hail but ultra processed food is gaining

244
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,640
a

245
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:23,839
field even with those

246
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:26,640
this this fresh food culture

247
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:28,480
so you can have an impact on many people

248
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:30,480
and in many countries

249
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,160
and we have many exciting projects that

250
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,880
you can contribute to

251
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:36,000
so you have we have native apps for

252
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:38,640
android and ios

253
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,160
so if you're an android or ios developer

254
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,959
you can help with that

255
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:45,279
we have the new cross-platform flutter

256
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:47,680
app that will be easier to use

257
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:48,839
for an even broader impact that we're

258
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:51,760
starting

259
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:54,080
planning we have the open food fact

260
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:55,200
intelligent artificial intelligence

261
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,279
called robotov

262
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:59,519
which is able to read labels so if

263
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:00,800
you're if you're a python or a

264
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:04,320
tensorflow addict

265
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:06,479
you can help with that um

266
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,000
we have the openfact database and

267
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:11,040
backend so if you're

268
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:14,160
uh if you code in per javascript python

269
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:15,279
you're very welcome as well and then on

270
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:18,319
top of that

271
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:18,880
gamification projects in javascript and

272
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,360
design

273
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:23,600
and front-end if you're more of a css

274
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:26,000
person

275
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,959
so this is very quickly some kind of

276
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,399
stuff that we do

277
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:31,040
using artificial intelligence for

278
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:34,880
instance we detect the nutriscore

279
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:37,599
and also if you live in a country uh

280
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:38,800
in any country actually you can help and

281
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,360
even if you don't have

282
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,880
any peculiar technical skills you can

283
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,680
help improve the support for your

284
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:46,160
country there are

285
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,959
so many food labels so many food

286
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:49,839
categories

287
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:50,959
that we need to to help translating them

288
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:53,600
into your language

289
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:55,518
and expanding the the knowledge of open

290
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,440
food facts

291
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:59,279
similarly you can help improve

292
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,040
ingredient detection in your country so

293
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:04,240
that we can compute the nova

294
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:07,519
and detect additives and you can help

295
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:10,000
with our growing environmental uh effort

296
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:12,079
to basically understand better if the

297
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,680
food has an impact on the planet so this

298
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:16,079
is for instance a map

299
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,800
of all the european food factories that

300
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:20,560
we made

301
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:22,719
thanks to the data so

302
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:24,719
many ways to contribute scanning new

303
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,519
products and adding them to open food

304
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,200
fact

305
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:30,320
translating open food fact into your

306
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:32,640
language there's a lot to translate

307
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,079
spreading the the word in your countries

308
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:37,279
among your friends

309
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:39,439
in the media designing

310
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:40,839
making the interfaces better we have

311
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:45,279
much room for progress

312
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:48,800
there hacking of course

313
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:49,839
and fixing bugs that are in open food

314
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:53,199
fact

315
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:55,200
and with this voluntary effort we've

316
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,320
been able to achieve many great things

317
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:59,279
in the past year

318
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:00,720
for instance we have a brand new api

319
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:03,279
documentation

320
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,920
thanks also to google's season of doc

321
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:06,160
program

322
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:09,120
so it's easier to basically manipulate

323
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:11,360
the data and play with food

324
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,399
i also would like to thank elnett for

325
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,680
its its support

326
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:18,480
we are going to be to build a

327
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:19,519
privacy first recommendation engine that

328
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,480
will let you make

329
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:25,120
better choices based on your preference

330
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:27,839
and the data won't leave your cell phone

331
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:29,680
so basically you will be able to find

332
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:31,839
the best other nut spreads

333
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,760
i mean nutella is obviously e but you

334
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:38,160
will be able to find

335
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:40,560
better solutions um on your device uh

336
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:42,160
base the tailor made to your if you're a

337
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:44,560
vegan if you're

338
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,279
if you have allergies that will be able

339
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:48,560
to to

340
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:48,560
take that into account

341
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:54,000
so thank you and a lot and finally we

342
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:56,480
are part of uh this year

343
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,360
of uh google we are candidate to google

344
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,519
summer of code

345
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:01,040
so if you wanna get involved either as a

346
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:03,600

00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:21,360
is a non-profit it's a it's a volunteer

355
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:23,760

thank you

359
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,160
yes

360
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:46,560
thanks for the card first um i tried the

361
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,399
app from asteroid the other day

362
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:50,560
and i was a bit surprised that it's only

363
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:51,600
with scanning so no textual input is

364
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:54,719
that right

365
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:56,639
but can you that all the

366
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,720
things i could to contribute is with

367
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:00,399
scanning images so taking pictures

368
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,079
instead of entering something manual

369
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:04,959
like for example with openstreetmap

370
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:06,560
is that correct uh so you can actually

371
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:08,800
the first thing that we uh

372
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:10,959
the app will ask you is take picture

373
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:14,000
because that's the source

374
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:16,719
of the data and if you don't have time

375
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,480
others can finish the work for you but

376
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,639
if you click on the edit button

377
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:22,000
you can enter a structure that are very

378
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:31,839
much like

379
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:31,839
open street map for instance

380
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:42,399
that's a very good question and i'm glad

381
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:46,000
you asked we don't

382
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:48,639
we're not scientists so we oh sorry

383
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,199
uh so the question is how do we grade

384
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:52,000
for instance

385
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:52,479
nutriscore nova how do we grade products

386
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,360
so

387
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:57,360
we are not scientists uh first point so

388
00:14:55,360 --> 00:15:00,320
we rely on scientific work

389
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:01,519
so nutriscore is an open formula by

390
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:03,839
professor serge

391
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:05,040
berg on nutritional so it takes into

392
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:08,399
account fats

393
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:10,719
salt sugar and for the nova it's a

394
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:13,440
scientific work by professor montero

395
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:15,600
so it's we the data is open the

396
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:18,160
methodology we ask the methodology to be

397
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,160
open as well

398
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,360
okay

399
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:40,000
if any of you have more questions i'll

400
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:40,000
be uh just next door
