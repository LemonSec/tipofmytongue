1
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:09,440
hello

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:13,200
yeah welcome uh

3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:17,039
with my talk about the

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:20,840
new possibilities in online editing of

5
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:24,000
open document and i added

6
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:27,198
interoperability uh i'm trying to give

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,920
a nice overview of the things that have

8
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:31,760
been

9
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:35,200
developed over the past year

10
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:36,719
roughly so all the new features that

11
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:40,160
have been added by

12
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:44,000
a lot of developers hardworking people

13
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:47,519
to uh to give the new platform

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,520
the new working

15
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:55,520
yes this works

16
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:58,000
about me a lot of things on the right is

17
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:00,239
the interesting thing my private life

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,760
which is busy on the left the business

19
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:03,358
thing which is uh

20
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,518
interesting too with open office

21
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:08,400
libreoffice since 2004

22
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,119
all kind of voluntary stuff and a known

23
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,360
company

24
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:15,680
and since 2019 last year part-time

25
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:17,360
helping collaborate with marketing and

26
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:20,640
it also has to do with how

27
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:24,000
the things change uh in marketplace

28
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,640
my my business mostly is uh helping with

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,920
training

30
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:31,759
with desktop stuff and since we see that

31
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:35,439
the the world people move to online

32
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:38,880
work that has influence on my

33
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:42,559
activity as well with

34
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:46,000
button so uh i i i have some

35
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:49,439
sections general writer text files

36
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:52,560
spreadsheets and and just mentioning all

37
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:55,199
nice uh features of course this is not

38
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,840
really new but it has been improved is

39
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,799
about

40
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,759
tracking changes commenting handling

41
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:03,280
commands

42
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:08,479
that has been nicely improved in

43
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:12,720
in in the libreoffice collabora online

44
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:16,480
next thing that's uh the formatting of

45
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:17,440
of bullets uh it has been made possible

46
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:21,200
to

47
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:24,239
get a lot of dialogues uh

48
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:27,040
visible and so that gives

49
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:27,520
all kind of features that are available

50
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:33,040
in

51
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:33,040
desktop also available in online

52
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:38,000
uh another thing that has been realized

53
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,959
and this is one of the examples that i'm

54
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,720
going to show

55
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:45,920
uh it it's it's the sidebar uh which

56
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:47,200
uh in in uh libreoffice desktop and also

57
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:52,319
in online

58
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:56,560
has an enormous amount of settings

59
00:02:52,319 --> 00:03:00,640
that you can do so so in this

60
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:03,760
in this case it's an uh

61
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,399
it's a shape that is selected and you

62
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:07,760
have

63
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:11,200
colors and you have also a custom

64
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:14,480
color picker that is available in

65
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,480
online nowadays

66
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:23,840
user interface and it has nice

67
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,840
new cleaner toolbox

68
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:33,440
another thing talking about

69
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:36,720
online and document editing

70
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:40,159
of course we prefer to work with

71
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:42,720
open document but quite

72
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:45,040
often we have to do with microsoft

73
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:48,319
office files

74
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:49,440
and this is an example of a microsoft

75
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:52,798
office file that's

76
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:55,040
just loaded in in uh clever online

77
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,720
and you can do a save as and you can

78
00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:00,079
save it as a

79
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:03,120
open document file and you see

80
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:06,480
if you load that same file it

81
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:09,760
just looks similar apart from the fact

82
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:11,280
that in this case there's a table

83
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:14,399
selected etc but

84
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:17,120
it just works so it

85
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,079
it our tooling also is is a bridge

86
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,639
between

87
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,280
the open standard and the microsoft file

88
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:25,280
format

89
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:26,479
sort of uh next thing that has been

90
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:29,919
nicely improved

91
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:33,039
is easier is the handling of images

92
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:34,000
shapes that are selected online you can

93
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,479
easily

94
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,040
turn them you see when you start to turn

95
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:39,840
them

96
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:41,120
it indicates how it how the result is

97
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:45,280
and

98
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:49,199
on the right indeed there is

99
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:53,039
how it works then

100
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:56,639
the next section is

101
00:04:53,040 --> 00:05:01,120
a bunch of items that has been improved

102
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:01,120
in working with text files

103
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,639
tables

104
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:12,639
if a table is activated you see the

105
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,360
markers for the rows and the columns you

106
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:17,120
can

107
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:20,240
drag them it's it's easy to work with

108
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:23,360
and on on the left of the screen you see

109
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:25,120
the sidebar that also has a section for

110
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,759
tables

111
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,479
where you can work with rows and columns

112
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:31,280
and things

113
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:31,280
like that

114
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:36,080
are the people here that work with

115
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:39,520
tables in online documents

116
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:42,880
now and then

117
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:45,680
sorry you tried and you failed or the

118
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,680
software failed

119
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:52,880
oh that's exceptional

120
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:53,198
okay but it was uh the thing you tried

121
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,800
was

122
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:57,919
was really complicated or it was an

123
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:04,080
early version or

124
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:07,039
yeah maybe

125
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,919
yeah okay yeah that it it's it's an

126
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:10,800
interesting

127
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:11,120
uh now now that we talk about this you

128
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,160
see

129
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,280
uh there's an and this is just a part

130
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,080
that i've told and

131
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:20,559
shown there's an enormous amount of

132
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:23,919
possibilities that people get online

133
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:27,440
and and this uh this application is also

134
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:30,799
the base for uh the ios

135
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,680
version of calebra and the new android

136
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,000
version

137
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,600
and so there's a ton of possibilities

138
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,880
that being added

139
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:42,400
and that are useful to have but

140
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:45,759
i i think when you have uh some speed

141
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:48,638
work to do with huge documents etc

142
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:50,720
the preferred platform in any case for

143
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:55,120
me still is this one

144
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:58,000
just for being able to work faster

145
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,880
but still it's great that when working

146
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,639
together

147
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:05,759
you can handle tables

148
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:09,440
and oh yeah there you see the

149
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,440
various handles indicated

150
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,759
table of contents

151
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,280
if there is a table of content you can

152
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:20,400
do a refresh so that it

153
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:23,359
gets updated you can also do the setting

154
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,960
so adding the styles adding extra lines

155
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:28,319
things like that

156
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,318
it's available online

157
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,479
another interesting thing is uh text

158
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:36,560
files

159
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:39,680
often have sections that are

160
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:42,000
that can be locked that can be protected

161
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:45,599
by passwords

162
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:48,160
in this case um i'm not sure

163
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:48,639
oh yeah it it's a it's an uh a doc x

164
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,759
file

165
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:55,360
microsoft x file where you

166
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:59,759
can add a protected section and

167
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:03,039
oh welcome with your bicycle

168
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:03,039
and and you can uh

169
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:07,039
and and you can simply handle these

170
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:11,039
protected

171
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:14,479
uh things that are available

172
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:16,159
in the open document format and that are

173
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:19,039
available in the microsoft

174
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,919
office format you can handle them in

175
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:24,000
libreoffice

176
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:26,719
collabora online and

177
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,280
so that means a great compatibility

178
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:31,039
there are

179
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:33,439
applications out there that are

180
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:34,319
saying they're extremely compatible but

181
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,919
basic stuff

182
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:41,760
like protection and section uh

183
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:45,600
it's it doesn't exist there but

184
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:48,160
it is handled here another nice

185
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:50,880
thing is the watermark and also here you

186
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:53,839
see the availability of a dialogue

187
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,560
uh all kind of settings so that you can

188
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:57,760
tweak

189
00:08:54,560 --> 00:09:00,880
it to your needs

190
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:04,399
the next thing is about spreadsheets

191
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:08,399
which are often used

192
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:12,000
also here cell protection

193
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:15,440
if you try to change something that's

194
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,920
protected it will just fail and you will

195
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:20,839
get

196
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:24,399
notified data validation

197
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:26,959
uh most people

198
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:28,080
know it anyway those people work with

199
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:31,920
spreadsheet

200
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:35,200
online it's just available

201
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:40,959
and if you try things to do that are not

202
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:44,320
allowed again you will be notified

203
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:47,119
then page formatting

204
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:50,320
of a spreadsheet it can be tedious there

205
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:53,519
can be a lot of things that are

206
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:56,880
needed to set so general things

207
00:09:53,519 --> 00:10:02,000
but also headers

208
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:02,000
footers and as a last thing how it is

209
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:05,760
scaled for example when you doing export

210
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,959
as pdf

211
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,959
things you can

212
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:14,240
do it as if it is on the desktop

213
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:16,079
then the conditional formatting for

214
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:19,040
example

215
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:20,000
this already is a bit longer existing

216
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,160
maybe it has been

217
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,480
extended but in in the toolbar you can

218
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,480
choose

219
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:32,320
various conditional formatting formats

220
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:35,199
they will be applied to the selection

221
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,200
in the spreadsheet

222
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:44,640
i make a little side step

223
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:46,480
paste special in spreadsheets

224
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:48,240
and that's nothing new that's there

225
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:51,360
already for a long time

226
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:52,079
also allows you to do some uh special

227
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,519
actions

228
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:58,640
for example uh the number 30 here

229
00:10:55,519 --> 00:11:00,320
is has been copied and

230
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,920
you do a paste special over the

231
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:05,279
selection and you can

232
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:08,319
choose to subscribe a subtract

233
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:11,839
excuse me and so uh in

234
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:16,320
also online uh the numbers

235
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:18,720
will be changed

236
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,519
and then if you do conditional

237
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,880
formatting

238
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:23,519
in this example with database you see

239
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:27,040
that

240
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:29,839
the the possibilities are

241
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,839
all available

242
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,760
quite new in the spreadsheet is that you

243
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:39,519
can

244
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:42,959
now zoom somewhere between

245
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:46,800
60 and 100 or 200

246
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:50,000
180 200 percent that's

247
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,000
much more convenient

248
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:57,440
and in spreadsheet grouping of

249
00:11:54,160 --> 00:12:01,199
rows and columns to collapse stuff

250
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:04,399
it's interesting it's still

251
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,920
wishes out there for example to freeze

252
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:08,160
the first

253
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:09,680
row in in spreadsheet online that's

254
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:13,279
still on on the wish list

255
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:17,120
so we're not all not fully there

256
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:20,639
but uh editing of charts

257
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:22,959
it's uh available both in the

258
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:24,399
in the sidebar on the right you see you

259
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:28,000
can set properties

260
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:32,240
but you can also launch the dialogs to

261
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,240
do various things

262
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,240
and the last thing for the spreadsheet

263
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:40,880
is the

264
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:43,519
formula editor similar to

265
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:45,600
as available on the desktop but it

266
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:48,560
allows you to choose

267
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,519
formulas it allows you to look into the

268
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:53,359
structure

269
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:56,639
find errors combine

270
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,639
functions etc

271
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,880
the next thing is what we are doing here

272
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,839
it's about

273
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,839
presentations

274
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,079
master slides

275
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:21,040
people here that work with presentations

276
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:24,560
now and then that know the

277
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:28,319
use of master slides yeah

278
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:29,839
okay master slide is is basically a sort

279
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:33,440
of

280
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:36,240
page style in in the presentation

281
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:37,040
and if you change a master slide and the

282
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:40,079
master slide

283
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:40,480
also holds the formatting of the bullet

284
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:43,439
list

285
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:44,959
for example and if you change a master

286
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:48,480
slide all the

287
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:51,199
slides that have it applied will

288
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:53,120
show the new formatting now it's

289
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:57,199
extremely convenient of course

290
00:13:53,120 --> 00:14:00,880
when you work online that you also can

291
00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:03,680
use this functionality there

292
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,560
also new is that in the side pane on the

293
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:07,760
left you can

294
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:11,599
move you can drag slides to

295
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:15,040
a new position so

296
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:17,839
where where initially uh i think

297
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:19,040
two years ago a bit longer when you gave

298
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:21,839
presentations

299
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,399
online you had availability to to show

300
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:25,440
them

301
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:29,760
which is good which is still there and

302
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:33,519
they showed the the slight um

303
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:36,240
the the slide transits for example but

304
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:38,320
that was mostly it here you could do

305
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:41,279
some text and some shaping but now

306
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,600
you have really the options to do a lot

307
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:43,519
of

308
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:46,240
formatting and working on your

309
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:46,240
presentation

310
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:50,639
this is another thing header and footer

311
00:14:54,800 --> 00:15:01,760
and a last or nearly last thing is

312
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:07,359
editing of course in the sidebar of

313
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:07,360
charts for example and of shapes

314
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:10,560
and

315
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:17,680
this is a nice thing with a

316
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:18,800
libreoffice project photo and a picture

317
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:26,399
of

318
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:29,120
calebra team

319
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:30,000
and this uh this this are mostly the

320
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:33,040
features that i

321
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:36,639
get at they come in

322
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:39,680
libreoffice uh code almost

323
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:42,320
by itself but not really

324
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,719
it's always good to tell people how they

325
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,440
can

326
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,440
participate

327
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:52,320
what i understood from the presentation

328
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:53,359
from simon before here and it's quite

329
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:56,639
clear it's always

330
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:59,759
important for the for the

331
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:02,800
health of open source software that are

332
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:04,880
is that there is money available for

333
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:07,040
people who can

334
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,800
maintain it extend it improve it

335
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:11,040
whatever so

336
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:12,000
that's one thing the other thing is that

337
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:16,480
people can just

338
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:18,240
volunteer and look what they

339
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,839
want to work on and where they can

340
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:23,600
contribute

341
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:26,160
but on the collaborator of office

342
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:28,639
website there's a special page that

343
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:30,880
explains how it works with

344
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:32,160
with code libreoffice online collabora

345
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:35,120
online snapshots

346
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:35,120
where you can test

347
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:41,040

and see

350
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:48,839

351
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:51,040

352
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:52,959
organizations especially the large

353
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,599

358

need

361
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:12,639

collaborative office doing in the

376
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:53,520
netherlands i

377
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:56,420
say any big government or is the private

378
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:58,840
institutions running

379
00:17:56,420 --> 00:18:01,840
[Music]

380
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,840
um

381
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:08,880
yeah i know there are uh

382
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,440
various large organizations that use

383
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:13,360
either

384
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:14,320
libra or collabora um a mixed

385
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:18,479
environment

386
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:20,399
yeah yeah yeah yeah it it if you uh

387
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,520
if you look at at calebra offensive

388
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,640
libre office

389
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:25,760
um the most the difference is the

390
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,840
service you get

391
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:29,200
and that it's longer available that you

392
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:31,678
get special support

393
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,400
and if there are special patches and

394
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:35,679
features

395
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:39,200
you will get them first as a customer

396
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:42,240
uh but in the end uh in in libreoffice

397
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:45,360
in a different schedule and

398
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:49,520
without the support but all code that is

399
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:49,520
in collabora is in libreoffice as well

400
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:57,520
you can actually compare to i i think

401
00:18:56,559 --> 00:19:00,720
that makes sense

402
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:03,360
yeah i i don't know exactly there's

403
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:04,000
schedule but roughly you're right yeah

404
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,879
yeah

405
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:09,039
and and yes for the netherlands it i

406
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:12,559
worked there

407
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:13,440
in this environment about 16 years now

408
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:16,399
already

409
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:17,280
and but it doesn't mean that i know

410
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:20,080
everything that's

411
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,799
ongoing still you happen to talk with

412
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:23,039
people

413
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:24,799
either private or for a company and you

414
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:26,080
learn that they use it already for five

415
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:29,918
years or whatever

416
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:32,159
how can you know this so it's it's it

417
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:33,840
it's also freedom in the sense that

418
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:36,080
people don't have to tell you

419
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,959
when they download something and use it

420
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:41,199
yeah

421
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:44,080
okay okay thanks oh sorry

422
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,880
can you use the colabra in your own

423
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:48,159
environment

424
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:51,600
or do you have to use your service uh

425
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:52,080
there is a for example a code that you

426
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,399
can

427
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:56,720
install with the docker image and you

428
00:19:54,400 --> 00:20:00,000
can install it and it's free to use up

429
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:02,559
into 20 users and then there's a

430
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,280
then there's a message okay you're using

431
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:06,399
something

432
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:08,158
that's for free but it's not supposed to

433
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:13,360
be used in larger environments

434
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:13,360
just for the uh etc

435
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:21,840
anything that i missed okay thank you
