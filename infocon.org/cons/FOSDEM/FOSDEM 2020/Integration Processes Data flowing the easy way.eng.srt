1
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:12,480
well i can start by saying um

2
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:15,040
phosphory calgary i guess you have seen

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:18,720
the stickers there you should be there

4
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:19,038
and if you like the fosdem you're going

5
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,880
to

6
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:26,480
love phosphory and

7
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:26,480
this is not what i'm going to talk about

8
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:31,119
and i put this shirt because i saw this

9
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,040
morning some

10
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:34,880
cuties i wasn't here but i saw on

11
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:37,040
twitter some qg's thing that is very

12
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:39,840
similar to what i'm going to say here

13
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,800
so i didn't want to forget that if

14
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,960
whoever did

15
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:48,000
these qg's um

16
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:50,160
like a scratch for qgs i don't know if

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,840
that person is here i'm interested in

18
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,639
that because maybe that can be plugging

19
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,000
for this

20
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,000
and this is not what i'm going to talk

21
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:03,280
about

22
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:03,280
so this is what i'm going to do the what

23
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:09,920
uh no this is

24
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,920
i still have another one but no

25
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,520
we still have three minutes right i

26
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,880
should be

27
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:18,399
president i don't know how many t-shirts

28
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,399
you have left no no no

29
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,960
i just wanted to not forget about

30
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:28,158
talking about calgary and

31
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:29,919
qgis maybe you could start a little

32
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:33,200
introduction of yourself

33
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:36,479
as a professional okay hi

34
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:40,960
i'm maria until

35
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:45,520
november i was the president of osgio so

36
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:45,520
maybe you that ring a bell for you

37
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:51,280
in june i change my career and i'm

38
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:53,439
working for red hat

39
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,479
so i start working with middleware which

40
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:57,119
is not

41
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:57,520
geospatial but when i started working

42
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:00,799
there

43
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:04,000
i realized that it has to to do a lot

44
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:09,920
with you especially in the end because

45
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,919
the integration processes are about um

46
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,879
workflow data workflows moving data from

47
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:17,840
one place to another so

48
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:19,679
it just makes a lot of sense to do it

49
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,360
with geospatial data because in the end

50
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,840
all data is geospatial

51
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,840
remember

52
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:28,080
and still two minutes

53
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:38,720
how many what two

54
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,319
if not that's not a camel it's a

55
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:43,040
dromedary

56
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:44,720
or a jammer a llama jamma how is it

57
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:47,040
called in english

58
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:51,840
or a horse if it doesn't have any if

59
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,840
it's a horse

60
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:18,000
uh a donkey that's right

61
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:22,400
two minutes

62
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:25,840
apologies is still watching paint dry

63
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,840
or hearing it dry maybe

64
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:32,080
i was thinking on future versions of

65
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,640
this talk i'm going to bring a camel

66
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:36,239
puppet

67
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:39,440
and some bricks to show but i i

68
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:41,040
can ask you a question sure i know the

69
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:43,440
names of all the presenters

70
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,640
but i've been here a couple of times who

71
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:47,680
are you where do i

72
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:51,040
find your name normally i don't

73
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:54,080
i don't tell people but no i'm mark

74
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:58,640
bluemont and i'm sort of

75
00:03:54,080 --> 00:04:01,760
running in open geospatial

76
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:04,000
circles for already now 20 years okay

77
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,000
so

78
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:11,519
phosphorus dna yeah i've

79
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:15,040
organized phosphorus in america i've

80
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:15,040
contributed to the golden

81
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:26,720
had my own company i sold it off

82
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,720
which gets open geospatial services

83
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:30,960
products work as

84
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:32,560
since then as a consultant when i walk

85
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:43,680
where i want

86
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:45,600
and that's just being verified

87
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,520
then you should go to calgary photos for

88
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:50,560
you i'll see you in 20 years

89
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:53,359
okay the floor is yours hi

90
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:55,680
so hi again i'm maria and i'm going to

91
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:58,960
talk about integration processes

92
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:01,600
which is a bit of camel breathing

93
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,799
so what am i going to talk about i'm

94
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,960
going to talk about

95
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:08,000
open source integration frameworks for

96
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:12,320
e-pass on hybrid platforms using iip

97
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,320
which translates to a lot of passwords

98
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:17,440
it's framework for data workflows which

99
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:20,479
is again a lot of passwords so it's just

100
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:23,360
moving data between components

101
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:25,840
so what does this mean that's this is

102
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:28,000
when i take the puppet

103
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,198
um so you have different components

104
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,400
which may be

105
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:34,479
databases apis um

106
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:36,080
maybe you want to take some file from

107
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:39,120
some folder in your

108
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:43,520
or web tab or

109
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:46,960
you have twitter salesforce

110
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:48,320
and you want to to have components and

111
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:51,359
you want to

112
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:54,960
connect them and

113
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:57,199
try to get data from a to b

114
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,000
the response that comes from b when you

115
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:01,199
have a

116
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:04,479
as a input parameter go to c

117
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:05,120
and then get the response from c so how

118
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:08,240
can we

119
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:10,080
do this on a good way

120
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,520
because usually what you do when you

121
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,599
have different components and you need

122
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,639
to interconnect them is just you write

123
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:18,000
your own script

124
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:19,759
or piece of code and then you have to

125
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,240
maintain that piece of code which

126
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:24,160
is in the long term or even the short

127
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:27,520
term that's not a good idea

128
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:29,600
so how can you do this on a decoupled

129
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:32,159
way when what you're trying to do is

130
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,720
couple of different components that's

131
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,960
where the

132
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:39,600
integration frameworks come into

133
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:41,280
into the problem because you can use an

134
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:44,800
integration framework

135
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:48,239
to be able to integrate the different

136
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:50,160
components on a very decoupled way so

137
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,120
you don't have to worry about the code

138
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,280
that is

139
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,360
running and moving the data you just

140
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:57,440
worry about the inputs and outputs of

141
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:59,440
each step

142
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,719
so does this mean that an integration

143
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,759
framework is just

144
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:07,120
putting data online and moving it from

145
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:08,960
one step to the next now you can also

146
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,360
have

147
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,080
like conditionals and say okay depending

148
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,639
on the

149
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,199
response from the previous step i'm

150
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:18,479
going to

151
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:21,120
choose if i want to maybe send an email

152
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:21,680
and a warning to someone or maybe i want

153
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,440
to

154
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,440
store something on the database or maybe

155
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:27,680
i want to do both depending on

156
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,800
what happened before and maybe later i

157
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,360
want to aggregate

158
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,319
that different flows of data or maybe i

159
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,199
want to

160
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:36,400
oh no this is what is called enterprise

161
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:39,520
integration patterns

162
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:40,080
if you are into software engineering you

163
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:43,120
should

164
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:44,080
have heard about software design

165
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,720
patterns

166
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:48,080
well for messaging and integration we

167
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,039
have a similar thing which is the

168
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,800
enterprise

169
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:52,080
integration patterns there is also a

170
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,720
famous book

171
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:55,840
with 50 integration patterns that are

172
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,080
like this

173
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:59,440
conditionals broadcast aggregations

174
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,639
parallelize things

175
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:07,440
severalize things i don't remember

176
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:07,440
all the 50 of them so

177
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:13,599
what kind of software can we use

178
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:15,039
that implements these enterprise

179
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:18,319
integration patterns

180
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:21,919
or similar patterns that

181
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:23,280
we can use to move data from one

182
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:25,280
one place to another which is the

183
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:27,919
integration frameworks

184
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:29,520
one option is apache camel which is my

185
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:31,198
shirt

186
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,120
this is from the apache software

187
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:36,159
foundation

188
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:38,799
we have been on a stand both at the

189
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:41,760
apache software foundation stand and

190
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:42,799
on the bottom floor on the k building uh

191
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:46,160
for integration

192
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:49,040
processes pattern and

193
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,680
it's open source it was the most active

194
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,199
project

195
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,959
in the apache software foundation from

196
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:56,399
last year and it's old

197
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:58,800
15 years old or something we also have

198
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:01,440
spring integration spring integration is

199
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:03,279
very good if you're working with spring

200
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,880
but it's true that it's not as complete

201
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:07,279
as camel because it's

202
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:08,000
newer so it doesn't have as many

203
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:12,160
components

204
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,839
as the rest um also it integrates very

205
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,719
well with spring but if you are not

206
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:16,880
using spring

207
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,839
maybe you are not even using java this

208
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:20,800
is not

209
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:21,360
what maybe what you need there's also

210
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:26,319
mule

211
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:28,640
sb which is partly open software partly

212
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,800
restricted license you have to pay for

213
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,640
to the company so

214
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,240
yes it's an option not the one i would

215
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:36,720
chose and

216
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,839
we have synthesis which is for

217
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,480
non-developers

218
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:41,440
managers because it's uh like a user

219
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,880
interface on top

220
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:46,800
of apache camel and you can

221
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:49,200
do the same things you do with apache

222
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:50,000
camel but without writing any line of

223
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,680
code because it's

224
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:56,959
just drag and drop clicking clicking

225
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:59,599
and we have the

226
00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:01,518
icon from red hat so i have to mention

227
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,519
that of course all these things

228
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:04,959
usually have companies behind that gives

229
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:07,760
you support

230
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:08,160
and some of those companies like red hat

231
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:12,240
has

232
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:14,640
fuse which is apache ml synthesis and

233
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,440
some other components that are open

234
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:18,319
source

235
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,120
it doesn't have any extra feature that

236
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,800
is not

237
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:23,760
open source and they are just deploying

238
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,399
and giving support

239
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:28,079
so what i'm going to focus is on apache

240
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:31,200
camel and synthesis

241
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:32,319
not only because that's what i'm working

242
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,360
on but

243
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:36,720
also because um i think they are the

244
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,600
most

245
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:41,360
complete and at the same time open that

246
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:44,800
there is right now

247
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:48,000
out there and i really

248
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:50,000
dig a bit and it's not seriously it's

249
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,600
if there was some other competitor that

250
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,440
was good enough i would

251
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:56,560
show it here so as i said apache camel

252
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:59,680
is one of the most

253
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:00,959
active projects in the apache software

254
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:04,239
foundation

255
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:06,079
it has 325 different protocols it

256
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:10,320
understands so it can be

257
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:13,519
doing an http call salesforce twitter

258
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:18,079
google sheets amazon

259
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:21,120
dynamodb it runs over java

260
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:24,399
but you can define the

261
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:27,600
roots i mean what you do is

262
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:31,680
just define a route all the steps

263
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:34,880
each step is like one two three uh lines

264
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:37,519
which is uh this is a

265
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:40,480
database these are the credentials this

266
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:43,839
is the sql or this is twitter this is my

267
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:46,079
token and my all the things twitter ask

268
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:49,920
you to

269
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:51,920
to do some queries so it's very simple

270
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,680
you don't have to worry just the the

271
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,599
custom parts that you

272
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:57,839
have to tell because it is not

273
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,760
intelligent and you can define this in

274
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:02,880
javascript in groovy

275
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:07,200
in xml of course in

276
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:08,880
java in so it runs over java but you can

277
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,240
communicate with it in different

278
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:13,439
languages

279
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:16,399
and it works in plain java

280
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,200
it works with spring boot so if you were

281
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:19,120
thinking that

282
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,800
maybe i should use springy decorations

283
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:23,440
because it integrates

284
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:25,839
very good with spring apache camel also

285
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:28,959
integrates with spring

286
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:31,040
and now we have camel k

287
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:32,959
which is like a separated project that

288
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:36,240
is going to be the main

289
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:37,199
project for the next major version which

290
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:41,440
runs over

291
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:44,480
kubernetes so it talks kubernetes

292
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:46,959
if you don't know what kubernetes is all

293
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:51,120
these docker container things

294
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:54,560
so instead of having to

295
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:58,240
run on plane java you can um

296
00:12:54,560 --> 00:13:02,239
define the route give it to camel k

297
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:05,440
with or also described as

298
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:08,560
k mel with k

299
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:10,959
and it just creates the

300
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:12,000
container and runs it and it's very very

301
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:14,079
fast

302
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,600
if i can do a demo and it doesn't work

303
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:19,279
you will see it later

304
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:22,480
and of course as it talks kubernetes it

305
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:22,480
also runs on quarkus

306
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:27,120
this is not only a connector library

307
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,000
this is a framework and when i say a

308
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,320
framework i

309
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,360
really mean it i mean it's something

310
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:34,880
that allows you

311
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:36,079
to really the couple from what you are

312
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:39,839
trying to connect

313
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:43,439
and you are you don't have to worry

314
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:44,720
just about uh giving the details about

315
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:48,079
where do you want to connect

316
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:50,320
how do you want to maybe convert

317
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:51,920
the output of one step to the input of

318
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,680
the next because maybe you are not using

319
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:57,360
the same data models of course

320
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:59,040
maybe twitter is uh giving some data

321
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,639
model that is not what you want to store

322
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:05,439
exactly in the database so you

323
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:07,839
can map that you can do small processing

324
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,639
and all this in five megas which is very

325
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:12,079
light big

326
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:14,320
weight so how does this work

327
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:16,319
internally how is it possible that we

328
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:19,360
can decouple something that is

329
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:22,160
coupling components well

330
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:23,279
so we have two external systems we want

331
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:25,680
to send messages

332
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:26,720
or data from one system to the net to

333
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:30,079
the other

334
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:33,279
back and forth for that the framework

335
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:38,000
has a router that takes each message

336
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:38,000
and decides where it is going to send it

337
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:42,800
the router to interact with the external

338
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,560
components need

339
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:47,120
the consumer and the producer the

340
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:49,279
consumer consumes messages from

341
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:51,360
the external system understands it

342
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:54,560
communicates and understands

343
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:57,519
send it to the router the router decides

344
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:59,359
where is it going to go and then there

345
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:01,600
is another part which is the producer

346
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:03,600
that understands how to communicate with

347
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:06,320
the second external system

348
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:07,519
and it sends back and forth the the

349
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:11,360
messages

350
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:14,079
and i call this i call exchange

351
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,639
the data we are sending between one and

352
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:17,839
uh

353
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:21,440
and another because that's what we are

354
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:24,959
using the the glossary we are using

355
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:26,639
of course the router can also decide if

356
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:28,959
there is some data mapping that has to

357
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:30,959
be done because you define it

358
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:32,560
or some type conversion the tag

359
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:33,839
conversion you can define the type

360
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:36,399
conversion like

361
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:37,199
i want to convert from xml to json

362
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:39,279
because uh

363
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:41,040
even if i'm working with plain text

364
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:42,959
that's what i need

365
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:45,120
or it can be an automatic conversion for

366
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:46,560
example if i'm reading from from a file

367
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,880
problem using a

368
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:50,638
buffered stream reader blah blah blah

369
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:53,040
and then i want to

370
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:53,680
send http connection which is another

371
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:56,800
type of

372
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:59,839
stream writer

373
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:03,758
and so this is

374
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:05,519
how it will look longer with a longer

375
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:07,120
workflow with two steps

376
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:09,279
and as you can see the producer and the

377
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:14,320
consumer

378
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:17,120
are fit very well together why because

379
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:18,240
the the what the producer produces is

380
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:21,759
what the consumer

381
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:25,040
understands which is called an endpoint

382
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:27,440
so it's like this uh you

383
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:29,040
may notice that the exchange a is not

384
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:31,519
the exchange

385
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:32,240
that gets to the point and point d i

386
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:35,680
don't know why

387
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:38,959
call it d because uh every time it gets

388
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:42,160
through an end point and connects with

389
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:44,239
some external system it gets the data

390
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:46,160
and then

391
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:48,160
have a response and it's the response

392
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:50,399
which travels forward

393
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:52,000
and we can have a more complex system

394
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:53,600
and as you can see the thing that

395
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,680
arrives to the end point

396
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,040
at the top is not the same at that point

397
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,560
on the bottom because it

398
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:02,240
goes through different endpoints so the

399
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:05,678
responses for each step are different

400
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:07,439
uh this is just what an exchange has

401
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:08,880
just mentioned that it's very similar to

402
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:12,880
an http

403
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:16,160
uh so it has headers it has

404
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:18,400
a body it may have attachments files

405
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,839
and if there is some error it has an

406
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,160
excess place to

407
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:23,119
to put an exception it has a unique id

408
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,799
so you can

409
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:27,039
see how is it flowing through the

410
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:30,879
workflow

411
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:34,720
and i'm going to try some

412
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:38,559
demo let's see if it works

413
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,559
because every time i um

414
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:40,960
i

415
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:48,640
i close the lap the la the delete

416
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:50,880
it's it breaks a bit so

417
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,880
uh

418
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:59,520
why yes so this is how a root is defined

419
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:00,000
so this is a very hello world thing it's

420
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,799
just going

421
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,559
to take uh every five seconds it's going

422
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:06,720
to look hello for them

423
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:07,760
send to a mock end point because we are

424
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:11,520
not doing anything

425
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:15,840
and then log how are you so

426
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:15,840
if i copy this

427
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:21,039
and passed

428
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:29,840
here why not

429
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:37,919
yes this is javascript by the way

430
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:40,320
so you can see you don't need to use

431
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:43,840
java and then i

432
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,840
run this thing

433
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:48,160
uh of course it's not there because it's

434
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:52,400
on

435
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:52,400
opt camera coming

436
00:18:54,840 --> 00:19:01,918
so

437
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:01,919
again very good maria very good

438
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:08,480
it's building the first build it takes a

439
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,039
bit of time because it's downloading

440
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:13,039
things

441
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:25,840
like the kind of endpoints he's going to

442
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:25,840
use don't let me hear don't let me hear

443
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:29,170
[Music]

444
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:41,440
it's not there yet

445
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:43,678
uh this is wiffy but

446
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:45,360
maybe i don't trust that so i'm going to

447
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:49,600
continue because

448
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:49,600
it's until uh how much time do i have

449
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:53,840
not much

450
00:19:55,919 --> 00:20:02,240
yeah so it also works with kafka but if

451
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:04,720
it's not working the internet and i'm

452
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:08,240
not even going to try but

453
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:12,559
uh you can get this was going to get

454
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:16,240
some um from a kafka broker stream

455
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:19,200
um messages let's just keep it

456
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:20,000
and this is like a conditional so

457
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:23,039
depending on

458
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,640
what we send well the message it

459
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:27,679
receives

460
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:31,200
when the body ends with

461
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:34,880
maybe i should make it smaller

462
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,520
when the body ends with uh exclamation

463
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:38,159
mark

464
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:40,080
then lock something if not then lock

465
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:44,480
something else

466
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:47,199
and we can even send it back

467
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:49,120
to the kafka stream the message so it's

468
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,799
going to

469
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:53,120
go again through all the workflow

470
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:57,039
because you can decide

471
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:59,120
uh on the the fro the process

472
00:20:57,039 --> 00:21:01,360
from the first step the two is all the

473
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:02,399
next steps on the two you can use the

474
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,479
same

475
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:07,919
things you used before so you can create

476
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:11,840
loops but be careful with that of course

477
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:13,840
so this is how you create a workflow

478
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:15,520
of course you don't have to use java you

479
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:17,520
can use xml which will

480
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:19,039
look something like this this is a

481
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:22,480
spring dsl

482
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:22,480
camel dsl thing

483
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:31,039
and for non-developers we have synthesis

484
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:34,879
so yeah let's just

485
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:39,120
uh show you this

486
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:42,320
if i can drag and drop

487
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:43,199
yeah so this will be synthesis this will

488
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:46,559
be

489
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:47,760
a hello world workflow very simple

490
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:51,039
because it's just

491
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:54,080
as i did before a timer with a log

492
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:56,400
i can add more steps here

493
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:58,000
i don't have internet so i cannot show

494
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:01,280
you this

495
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:04,140
sorry um

496
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:06,240
i will just show you them

497
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:09,360
[Music]

498
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:12,240
so here is an where you select which

499
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:15,360
kind of step you want to do

500
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:19,840
this will be a more longer

501
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:24,399
workflow with the data mapping that maps

502
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:24,399
like this like a drag and drop thing

503
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:32,399
no i don't know why it's not shown

504
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,400
completely

505
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:38,400
well it's drag and drop you have the

506
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:40,080
parameters the output parameters from

507
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:42,000
one step and the input parameters from

508
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:43,918
the next so you just

509
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,240
drag and drop which ones you want to

510
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:50,080
connect

511
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:51,280
this is the main view of the integration

512
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:54,960
you have done

513
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:57,440
this is the log so for each

514
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:59,039
run it generates a lock that is

515
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,400
beautified so

516
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:02,240
it's easy to understand for

517
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:05,919
non-developers

518
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:05,919
and no demo time

519
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,919
so as i told you i talk about an open

520
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,919
source

521
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:13,679
integration framework so you can do data

522
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:15,919
workflows easily

523
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:17,039
for integration process as a service

524
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:20,080
which is an

525
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:20,799
kind of a new concept which is this all

526
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:23,760
the docker

527
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:25,120
kubernetes container thing on hybrid

528
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:27,120
platforms because you can

529
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:28,879
run this this is open software but you

530
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:32,320
can run this on

531
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:32,960
um different platforms and you can

532
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:35,360
connect

533
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:36,159
even components that are not open source

534
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:39,760
like twitter

535
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:41,760
salesforce or i don't remember which one

536
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:43,840
using integra enterprise integration

537
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:47,919
platform uh

538
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:50,959
enterprise integration patterns

539
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:52,880
and i'm trying to work on adding

540
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,960
specific connectors for geospatial

541
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:57,760
because of course you can use

542
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:59,600
already geospatial data with this but

543
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:01,360
there are no specific

544
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:03,199
geospatial connectors that understand

545
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:06,000
that you are working with geometries and

546
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:09,200
can maybe a free project or whatever

547
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:13,200
and any help are welcome

548
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:13,200
and that's it okay thank you

549
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:28,559
we have one minute for 30 seconds
