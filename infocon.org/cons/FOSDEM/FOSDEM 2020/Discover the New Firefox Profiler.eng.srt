1
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:09,280
okay

2
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:10,800
hello everyone and welcome uh so yeah

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:13,040
as you said i'm going to talk about the

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,440
new firefox profiler today

5
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,640
and i'm also john i'm a software

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,160
engineer at mozilla

7
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:22,480
and i'm working on the performance

8
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:24,960
tooling team and you can find me there

9
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:27,199
so the firefox profiler is essentially

10
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,160
the profiler.firefox.com so you can

11
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:29,840
visit there

12
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,359
and there are some instructions but i'm

13
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:34,480
gonna walk you through everything

14
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:36,960
so bear with me uh so

15
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:38,718
this is a typical like screenshot from

16
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,600
firefox profiler

17
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:42,719
and like what's happening here like

18
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,399
there are a lot of

19
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,239
stuff going on like there are a lot of

20
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:49,920
colors there are a lot of

21
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:51,199
graphs so it's kind of intimidating at

22
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,640
first

23
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:57,199
for people to use that tool but

24
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,399
uh i'm gonna walk you through all the

25
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:01,039
panels and

26
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:01,840
every detail so you're going to be more

27
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:05,680
comfortable

28
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:07,520
to use that tool once we're done

29
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,040
so but essentially you should take a

30
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:11,759
look at back

31
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:13,680
and like we should learn what is a

32
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,799
profiler first

33
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:19,119
so profiler essentially helps developer

34
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:22,640
to analyze the performance issues

35
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:26,080
and gives insight

36
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:29,040
on into how program works

37
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:30,240
so it does that by sampling the prof

38
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,759
program

39
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:36,240
so what is sampling then uh so

40
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:36,880
profiler stop the execution of the

41
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,600
program

42
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,960
in a like a fixed rate for example one

43
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,320
millisecond

44
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:47,600
so and records the

45
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:50,320
relevant data for example that can be a

46
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,839
current stack it records the data and

47
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:55,520
resumes the profile

48
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:58,719
program later so in this graph

49
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:00,880
you can see a simple program and the

50
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:01,919
word the vertical lines are the

51
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:05,439
profiling

52
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,000
profiler sampling and those straight

53
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:09,598
lines

54
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,919
are the program execution and main calls

55
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:13,119
a

56
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:16,238
calls b and call c so

57
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:19,840
as you can see on the first peak first

58
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:22,879
sequel actually uh

59
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:26,560
profiler missed it because like

60
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:29,760
the red arrows are the stack

61
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:33,120
of the current uh program

62
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:36,239
and we managed to capture the main b but

63
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,680
at the at the first peak we actually

64
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:40,400
managed to

65
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,680
miss it because like the c runs less

66
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:45,680
than one millisecond

67
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:47,200
and uh it just falls between two

68
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,840
sampling time and

69
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,958
uh we didn't see it but rest of it like

70
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,519
as you can see on the

71
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:55,040
second peak second c call we actually

72
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:58,400
managed to capture that

73
00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:00,159
uh call so it gets all the stack

74
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:03,440
information in an interval

75
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:06,640
time and once we have that we aggregate

76
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:09,760
those data and we create something

77
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:11,040
like this a call tree so this is an

78
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,200
example from

79
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,079
firefox actually so there's a main

80
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,440
function

81
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:21,120
and there from the main there are other

82
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:24,400
calls so we

83
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,440
sample every millisecond and aggregate

84
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,560
that data and

85
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:31,840
also we create those timings from that

86
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,319
that aggregated data i'm going to talk

87
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,840
about

88
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:37,679
the sam the timing later so yeah

89
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,599
as we learned the samples provide a

90
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:42,640
weaving to the profile program

91
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:45,679
but as you can see on the

92
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:47,200
first sequel we can miss some stuff that

93
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,920
happens quickly

94
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,480
so markers to the rescue as an

95
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,760
additional

96
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,399
to the sample data in the profiler we

97
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:58,000
also have

98
00:03:54,400 --> 00:04:01,920
marker data and what are markers

99
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,599
so they are also very similar to samples

100
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,119
they are they provide even to the

101
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:08,959
executing code

102
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:12,080
but they don't miss anything because

103
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:13,200
we manually add those information in the

104
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,840
source code

105
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:17,279
and we also include additional

106
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,639
information for example

107
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:23,119
in this picture there is the

108
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:24,400
call stack the stack and then there are

109
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,960
some

110
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,239
additional information for styling so

111
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:31,599
this is a marker that

112
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:34,960
we add whenever there's a new styling

113
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,960
happens in a web page

114
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:42,160
so we learned those two

115
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:44,800
main data sources from a profiler

116
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,720
but what is the firefox profiler now

117
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,600
then

118
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:51,520
so the motto of the firefox profiler is

119
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:54,840
capture performance profile

120
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:58,240
analyze it share it and make the web

121
00:04:54,840 --> 00:05:01,758
faster so this is again the same one but

122
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:05,120
there are two main advantages of firefox

123
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:07,759
profiler and the first one is

124
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,199
you can see both javascript and the

125
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:12,880
native call stack

126
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:16,240
in a single call tree what that means is

127
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:19,600
so when you run a javascript

128
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:21,280
function in your web page and if that

129
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:24,400
function

130
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:27,599
for example adds a dom element and

131
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:29,758
we need to see the dom edition in the

132
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:33,280
firefox source code so

133
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:34,240
we also after that javascript frame we

134
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:37,119
also see

135
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:39,360
some firefox related native code

136
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,880
execution so you can also see that those

137
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,680
informations as well

138
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:45,039
uh also you can filter to just

139
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,759
javascript only so

140
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:48,800
if you are profiling your web page you

141
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:51,520
can just

142
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,000
see javascript that that's what it's

143
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:55,520
important

144
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,639
to you and the second part has two

145
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:59,599
branches

146
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:02,000
uh the first one is for actually

147
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:04,319
non-technical people

148
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
so if you're a non-technical person you

149
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:08,639
can just capture a profile

150
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,680
for example firefox is a performance

151
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,800
issue

152
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:16,400
and you you have you can reproduce that

153
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:19,199
but uh you don't know what to do so

154
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,599
what you can do is capture a profile and

155
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,160
then

156
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,800
share it with an expert in this case you

157
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,400
can

158
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:29,280
create a bug in bugzilla and you can

159
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:30,000
share the url of that specific profile

160
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:33,119
data

161
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:36,080
and some expert can come and

162
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:37,600
see that profile later also if you're a

163
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:40,560
technical person

164
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:42,319
you can capture it yourself it can be a

165
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:45,520
again a web page or

166
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:46,400
firefox and you can save it into your

167
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,639
desktop or

168
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:52,159
you can share it and keep the url and

169
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:54,960
then take a look at your data later

170
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:57,280
so uh we'll now learn that there are

171
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,880
actually two main uis in this

172
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:01,359
first you need to be able to capture a

173
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:04,400
profile and then you need to be able to

174
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:06,000
analyze it so we're gonna see the first

175
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:09,120
capturing ui

176
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,560
and uh how to capture a good profile

177
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,880
data

178
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:15,599
so first you need to go into the

179
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:18,240
profiler.firefox.com

180
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:19,280
and you just need to follow the

181
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,599
instructions

182
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,400
it's pretty straightforward there is a

183
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:25,360
big

184
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:27,120
button that says install add-on so you

185
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:30,000
need to install the add-on first

186
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,360
and once you install that uh you're

187
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,639
gonna see

188
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:36,240
this pop-up so this an icon will appear

189
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:39,199
on the top right side

190
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,720
of your firefox and once you click that

191
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:44,479
this pop-up appears

192
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:45,039
and there are two big like main buttons

193
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:48,479
here

194
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:51,440
so once the first one is uh

195
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:52,318
for you to start recording or stop

196
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:55,360
recording

197
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:56,319
and the second button is to capture that

198
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,759
profile

199
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:02,560
so a work for a typical workflow is this

200
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:04,560
first you need to make sure that you

201
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:07,440
don't have any background tasks

202
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:09,360
or tabs in your firefox so you need to

203
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:12,879
isolate that performance problem

204
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:15,919
as much as possible and once you do that

205
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:19,199
you need to start the profiler and

206
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:22,719
after that you can do the work that

207
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:23,840
that do you think there's a performance

208
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,879
issue for example

209
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:29,919
you can if there's a performance issue

210
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,800
during the page reload you can start the

211
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:33,838
profiler

212
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:36,560
and then reload it wait until it's done

213
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:38,399
and then capture the profiler once you

214
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:42,079
do that

215
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:44,360
a new tab will pop up and

216
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,519
it's going to bring you the profile at

217
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:48,320
firefox.com

218
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:49,279
again and now you're going to see the

219
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,959
data there

220
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:52,320
and you're going to see the analysis

221
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:55,839
data analysis

222
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,839
ui that we've seen before

223
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:02,959
okay so now we captured the profile

224
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:07,680
data and now we can actually

225
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:10,880
uh analysis and try to analyze it

226
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:14,079
so this is the ui i know

227
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:16,399
it's complicated at first but this

228
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,440
section is the timeline so as you can

229
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:20,800
see on the

230
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:24,720
top side here there's some

231
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:29,439
timing information and here

232
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:32,800
at first row there is a screenshot

233
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:35,839
track so it also records

234
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:38,880
screenshots of your firefox so you can

235
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:41,600
actually see the ui

236
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:43,920
and the code at the same time and try to

237
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:47,200
see what is happening here

238
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:51,120
and you can also hover over those and

239
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:54,480
try to see the bigger

240
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:57,519
screenshots and in this section

241
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,320
in this process uh this is the stack

242
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:01,519
graph

243
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,720
so we were capturing the stack uh during

244
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:05,279
the sampling

245
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,640
now we have that data and we aggregate

246
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:10,320
that and

247
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:13,199
we show a dense view here so it's

248
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,640
not great accessibility wise because

249
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,160
there are a lot of colors we're trying

250
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:18,720
to make it better

251
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,279
but the important color for example here

252
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,279
is

253
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:22,880
the yellow one because that means

254
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:25,040
javascript category

255
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:26,079
so you can also see other ones for

256
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:29,120
example dom

257
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:32,160
as blue and etc uh

258
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:34,480
and here you can see

259
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:36,000
uh the markers that we mentioned before

260
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:39,040
they're more precise

261
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:42,160
there are a lot of them so we again

262
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:45,040
put it into a dance to you and uh

263
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:46,160
you can hover over those and see the

264
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,839
details

265
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:49,600
of those markers for example this is

266
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:51,440
styling marker

267
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,720
and you can see some relevant

268
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,200
information

269
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,240
uh about that marker and you can see

270
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,600
that took

271
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:03,279
17 milliseconds which is quite long

272
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:05,839
usually and you can also actually

273
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:06,880
select a range during that timeline and

274
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:09,360
then you can

275
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:10,240
click into that magnifier icon in the

276
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,279
center

277
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:16,800
and you can actually make it make that

278
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:17,519
view the full view and you can zoom into

279
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,640
that

280
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:23,360
and as long as you want to uh

281
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:25,120
see what's happening there and the other

282
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:28,720
thing is we have

283
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:29,760
the panels so at the top of the profiler

284
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:33,600
we have the

285
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:36,800
danced view that we put everything but

286
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:39,920
on the bottom side there are more

287
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:42,399
information for you to see

288
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:43,519
this is more detailed so i'm not gonna

289
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:46,079
go into

290
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:46,880
each tab right now because we're gonna

291
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:50,560
see

292
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:54,000
uh those into the demo slide so

293
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:57,279
uh that's easier that way

294
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:00,320
but also uh so now we are

295
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:02,079
familiar with the ui but if you are a

296
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:04,240
non-technical person you don't

297
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:05,920
have to care about that you can you

298
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:09,360
should just know

299
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:12,560
how to share that profile

300
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:15,600
so inside the profiler data we have

301
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:16,160
a lot of different kind of data the

302
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,279
first

303
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:20,000
two ones are that we mentioned those are

304
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:22,240
the main ones

305
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,279
samples and markers and we have

306
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:26,320
screenshots

307
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:27,760
network requests metadata et cetera so

308
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:30,959
keep in mind those

309
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:33,040
and so once you get the ui

310
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:34,800
actually there's a button on the top

311
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:37,360
right corner

312
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:39,680
named publish so you can click into that

313
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:43,120
and this pop-up will

314
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:45,359
come up and here you can

315
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:47,200
actually remove some of your personal

316
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:50,240
data before

317
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:51,360
sharing it because as we can see on the

318
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,760
previous slide

319
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,720
there a lot of information and those

320
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:57,920
information

321
00:12:54,720 --> 00:13:01,360
can include some personal data as well

322
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:02,719
so here for example we can remove the

323
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,800
screenshots

324
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:06,320
that can be personal information or we

325
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:10,560
can remove the source

326
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:14,399
resource urls so once you remove those

327
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:17,680
you can click publish and

328
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:21,279
it's gonna just bring you the url

329
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:24,319
after that upload session is done

330
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:26,560
and now you have the url you can

331
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,920
just copy that and send it to someone

332
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:31,199
else or you can

333
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:34,560
post this into the bugzilla comment

334
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:35,920
and some other people can take a look at

335
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:39,920
that information

336
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:43,599
later and also we have

337
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:46,800
a single tab and advanced

338
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:50,000
view so this

339
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:52,399
profile ui is complicated and there are

340
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,120
a lot of firefox related information in

341
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:55,600
it as well

342
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,320
but if you're a web developer you don't

343
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,560
have to take

344
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:00,839
you don't have to know those and you can

345
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:02,880
just

346
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:06,000
uh see your

347
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:07,279
web content track and you can try to

348
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,639
analyze it

349
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:13,439
and so this is still a work in progress

350
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:14,639
uh so we are trying to make it the

351
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:18,000
profiler better for

352
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:20,880
web developers so you can easily start

353
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:24,399
using it but

354
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:25,199
it's it will happen very soon so you can

355
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:27,279
actually

356
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:28,959
just see the information that you want

357
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:33,040
to see

358
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:36,719
so let's go back to the demo section now

359
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:40,319
and now we can

360
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:45,839
see those panels and we can see

361
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:45,839
what is happening there

362
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:51,199
uh as you can see when once you open up

363
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,680
that

364
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:54,639
profile so by the way you can get those

365
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:58,000
slides

366
00:14:54,639 --> 00:15:01,120
here in that url and you can

367
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:04,720
get that demo

368
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:07,920
profile so you can take a look at that

369
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:08,720
so here you can click on that and once

370
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:12,479
you have that

371
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:14,320
you can see it so here

372
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,760
this is an example profile that we

373
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:18,880
captured before but

374
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:21,760
before that i want to actually uh show

375
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:22,560
how we capture it so we've seen the ui

376
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:25,439
before but

377
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:26,000
still i want to show you how to do that

378
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:29,279
so the

379
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:33,279
here here here we have

380
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:36,399
the add-on so you can press start

381
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:39,279
and now we are capturing the information

382
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:39,759
of firefox and that web page and now you

383
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:42,000
can

384
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:43,920
do some stuff for example we are doing

385
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,639
the tab switch now

386
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:47,040
to uh analyze the performance issue of

387
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:49,600
that

388
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:50,240
tab switch and now we we are done with

389
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,800
it and

390
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:54,720
we can click capture but i would

391
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:58,319
recommend you to use the

392
00:15:54,720 --> 00:16:01,519
uh shortcuts instead because uh

393
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:03,519
once you open this pop-up it actually

394
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:07,120
affects the performance of firefox

395
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:10,480
like you can it creates a new view and

396
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:12,240
paints it so to you can minimize the

397
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:15,519
usage of that pop-up and then

398
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:19,440
just use the shortcuts instead so that's

399
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:21,440
much better so once you done that

400
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:24,399
it captures it so this is the capturing

401
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:27,279
part and

402
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:29,199
let's go back to our profile so we have

403
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:32,399
the screenshots here

404
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:34,000
so you can actually hover over those and

405
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:37,360
see the

406
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,279
bigger version of those and

407
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,480
for example this is a profile that we

408
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:44,079
captured

409
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:45,680
during the wikipedia and we try to open

410
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:48,880
the dev tools panel

411
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:52,319
and then close it afterwards so

412
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,880
this part is the one that we open the

413
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:56,320
panel

414
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:57,120
as you can see here so we are opening

415
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:01,920
this

416
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:04,480
uh dab tools panel here and this

417
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,839
big stack is the dev tools

418
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:09,120
initialization

419
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:10,159
so here we start to initialize that dell

420
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:13,760
tools

421
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:16,720
as you can see and here it's done

422
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:17,439
at the end of that stack we initialized

423
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,480
it

424
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:22,959
and afterwards here we are

425
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:24,799
closing back again and this stack

426
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:28,480
corresponds to the closing part

427
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:30,879
so you can see uh what

428
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:34,160
functions that we are calling during the

429
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:37,280
initialization during the

430
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:39,600
dev tools opening and during the closing

431
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:41,440
and for example here a garbage

432
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:45,360
collection happens

433
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:49,280
once we are done with that data

434
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:51,039
so and those are the markers that you

435
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:54,320
can just hover over those

436
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:57,919
and see more information about them

437
00:17:54,320 --> 00:18:01,039
and usually

438
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:02,559
red bar means that you need to fix

439
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:04,160
something there's something

440
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:06,480
interesting going on there because

441
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:09,520
there's a delay happening there

442
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:13,120
so you need to minimize the

443
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:15,760
event processing delays essentially and

444
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:16,320
here we are doing a lot of work so we

445
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:20,400
can

446
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:23,760
just zoom into that view as well to

447
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:27,840
see what's happening and

448
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:30,000
uh also we can click into a marker to

449
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:33,439
automatically select that range

450
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:35,919
and we can zoom into that wheel so

451
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,720
once you're in there you can go back

452
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:39,919
here

453
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,919
to the full range

454
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,760
so let's take a look at that section

455
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:46,799
because there are

456
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:47,679
a lot of information there and there are

457
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:51,440
some interesting

458
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:54,640
things going on so we zoomed in here

459
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:58,559
and we are going to

460
00:18:54,640 --> 00:19:02,320
see the bottom of the page the tabs

461
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:04,160
so the this part is the part that we

462
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:05,360
need to analyze and we need to see what

463
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:08,480
is happening

464
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:12,240
so you can click each or you can option

465
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:15,679
click and you can expand everything

466
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:18,240
and you can try to analyze this data

467
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:20,080
so for example here there's a start

468
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,799
there's a main function of firefox and

469
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:23,120
there's

470
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:24,639
other functions happening but if you're

471
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:27,280
not a firefox

472
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:28,880
developer you don't need to know those

473
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:32,080
you can just

474
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:33,600
switch here to javascript and you can

475
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:37,039
only see the

476
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:40,080
frames that you actually

477
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:43,360
can change and here

478
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,918
you can again expand those and try to

479
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,439
see

480
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:47,440
for example on the left side there's a

481
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:49,840
run in time and this

482
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:51,280
callback this promise callback takes the

483
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:56,080
49

484
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:59,120
of the time and it is 295 milliseconds

485
00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:01,760
so it's very high

486
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:03,280
and we can see the stop time here so the

487
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:07,200
running time is the

488
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:08,000
whole time including the nested function

489
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:11,600
calls

490
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:14,720
and the self time means the time

491
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:18,080
actually that function itself

492
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:19,120
takes so we can try to see for example

493
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:22,559
there's a

494
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:25,678
uh 10 millisecond self sign

495
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:29,280
self time happening here so

496
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:31,440
that's a red flag so we can try to see

497
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:33,440
what that load function actually does

498
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:37,200
and maybe we can try to

499
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:40,559
make it more performant or let's see

500
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:42,720
other things uh

501
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:43,678
so there's a seven millisecond again the

502
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:46,799
load function

503
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:48,960
interesting so

504
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:51,039
that means that that load function does

505
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:54,080
a lot of work i don't know if

506
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:54,960
it actually has to do it or maybe you

507
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,879
can

508
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:59,520
do some tweaks and make it more

509
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,520
performant

510
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:05,200
here another load function so we start

511
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,320
to see a pattern here so there are a lot

512
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:09,200
of

513
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:10,399
individual load function calls happening

514
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:13,440
maybe we can

515
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:16,159
just merge them together try to

516
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:18,080
call everything at once instead of just

517
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:22,080
doing everything

518
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:24,480
uh or yeah we can just try to

519
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:25,280
see how we can reduce that time and this

520
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:28,840
is the culture

521
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:30,240
basically so this is the that and the

522
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:33,280
second tab

523
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:34,640
is a bit more visual so this is the

524
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:37,840
flame graph

525
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:40,799
and this is essentially the same data

526
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:41,600
with the call tree but you you now have

527
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:45,600
a bottom

528
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:48,959
up uh call us tag here

529
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:51,360
so you see the

530
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:53,039
longest running functions here for

531
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,479
example this is the promise call stack

532
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:58,480
that we've seen before

533
00:21:54,480 --> 00:22:01,280
and once you go up you see the other

534
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:02,000
functions and you can hover over those

535
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:05,280
again and

536
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:07,840
see more details about

537
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:09,200
those functions and for example you can

538
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:11,280
see

539
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:13,440
how long overall takes or how long

540
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:17,440
javascript interpreter actually

541
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:19,280
takes that time and you can again

542
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,640
change this text you can change the

543
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:24,320
javascript only or

544
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:26,960
native only so native only means that

545
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:28,320
basically c plus plus rust or if you're

546
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:32,240
on android

547
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:36,000
it can be uh kotlin or java

548
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:38,559
so it depends and this is the javascript

549
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,440
and if you change it back to all all

550
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:43,120
stacks

551
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:45,120
it will show you everything here

552
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:46,719
so the stack chart is also pretty

553
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:49,520
similar with the first one but

554
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:50,720
the difference with the flame graph is

555
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:53,600
the first thing

556
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:55,120
this is the top down and the most

557
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:58,240
important

558
00:22:55,120 --> 00:23:01,600
difference is this x axis

559
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:04,320
is actually the time so if you

560
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:04,799
go back to the full range you actually

561
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:08,000
see

562
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:11,039
those frames here and

563
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:14,480
you see those frames here

564
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:15,440
so you can see the timing information

565
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:18,559
and

566
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:22,720
what frame is being called

567
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:25,360
in what time so and

568
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:26,880
you can go back to marker chart so this

569
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:30,158
is the same data with the

570
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:32,880
those markers but it's more detailed

571
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:33,440
and grouped for example you can see the

572
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,320
dom

573
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:38,080
group the garbage collection graphics

574
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:41,678
javascript etc

575
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:43,439
and uh you can see more information if

576
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:46,880
you hover over those

577
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:51,360
and a marker table is the same data

578
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:53,840
but with a table also by the way you can

579
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:54,639
filter whatever you want for example if

580
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:58,158
you want to

581
00:23:54,640 --> 00:24:01,679
see the load events

582
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:04,720
you can write load events and you'll see

583
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:07,840
load dom events for example

584
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:08,960
this is the before load before unload

585
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:12,559
and load and

586
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:14,080
stuff and you can see this network load

587
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:17,200
function

588
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:19,120
markers so

589
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,799
and you can do that filtering pretty

590
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:23,918
much everywhere

591
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:27,039
you can do that here as well you can see

592
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:30,320
only load functions and

593
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:33,919
the last tab is the network tab

594
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:37,039
so that helps you to

595
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:39,760
see what network requests are being

596
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:40,240
made in this profile session and you can

597
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:43,440
again

598
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:43,840
hover over those and you can see how

599
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:48,400
long

600
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:51,600
does it take and you can see a more

601
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:55,279
detailed view into that http

602
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:58,559
request um yeah i think we are

603
00:24:55,279 --> 00:25:00,240
pretty much out of time like we have two

604
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:03,440
seconds two minutes i guess

605
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:07,600
so i'm gonna

606
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:10,720
close up the demo and

607
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:14,158
one second so you can learn

608
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:16,480
more information in this documentation

609
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:18,400
you can go in there and try to see you

610
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:22,240
can also get those slides

611
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:26,080
and you can take a look at those again

612
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:29,360
and if you have any question please

613
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:30,799
just join into our matrix channel it is

614
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:33,600
profiler

615
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:34,639
and just ask us anything we are happy to

616
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:37,918
help you

617
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:43,760
uh you can just ask us so

618

yeah uh we can have like one or two

622
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:51,840
questions till i ask the next speaker to

623
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:57,840
come and set up

624
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:57,840
