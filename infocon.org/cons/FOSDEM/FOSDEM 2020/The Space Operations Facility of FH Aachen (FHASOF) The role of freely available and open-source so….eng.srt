1
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:10,480
that's great we're at half past so we'll

2
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:12,799
start off with the next speaker

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,960
i want to particularly thank sasha here

4
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:18,000
for stepping in at the last minute

5
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:20,560
we had a speaker who was unable to reach

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,279
brussels due to some travel issues and

7
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:24,320
so uh

8
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:25,680
on two days notice i'm very very happy

9
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,840
that we have this talk

10
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,800
uh and i'll let you mostly introduce

11
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,880
yourself uh

12
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,480
and the space operations facility at

13
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:36,239
ochen thank you

14
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:39,360
thank you very much thank you so

15
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:40,559
very much for for getting the the

16
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,680
opportunity

17
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:45,360
to having this talk actually we should

18
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:48,640
have this talk two people

19
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,640
but uh my co-mates uh decided to drive

20
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:53,680
by car because it was not an aachen

21
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:56,719
and the car got broke so i have also

22
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:59,920
now to present his his faults

23
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:03,920
but we we will make the best

24
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:08,479
so um we are so uh

25
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:12,640
i come from uh university

26
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:16,080
and uh um i set up there

27
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:19,280
and uh with uh most uh scholars and

28
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:22,320
and uh bachelor students and uh

29
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:25,040
a ground station uh

30
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:27,520
that aims to uh to be like a

31
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:30,079
multi-purpose ground station so

32
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:31,200
most of uh most of the operations we

33
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:34,399
perform

34
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,360
is ham with sand-based satellite my

35
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,840
first access

36
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,400
was not in the space industry or so uh

37
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:42,720
i'm

38
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:45,600
a chemist and in a

39
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:47,520
little project with this pocket cube you

40
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:50,798
see there

41
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,759
my best friend who we was an informatic

42
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:54,000
guy

43
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:55,040
wanted to to develop this satellite and

44
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,240
then

45
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:01,360
he asked me if i could help with uh

46
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:05,600
uh managing all the the stuff between uh

47
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:08,478
the launch provider uh based in italy

48
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,878
and and our little little little three

49
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,480
men

50
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:15,519
uh group and uh

51
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:17,920
then later i became then uh responsible

52
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,959
for setting up a ground station with

53
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:22,319
basically

54
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:25,040
no knowledge at all so it was really

55
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:26,238
uh uh try to do something and the best

56
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:29,920
with it and then

57
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:32,400
uh we had a somehow somewhat successful

58
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:34,480
mission the brand mission with this

59
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,879
first pocket cube which was a one unit

60
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:40,238
pocket cube at that time

61
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:40,239
back in 2013.

62
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:47,679
later on because

63
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,239
for that mission we had no no funding at

64
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,120
all

65
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:51,519
we had a little bit crowdfunding money

66
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,400
but

67
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:55,440
we so we had everything got into the

68
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,400
development and

69
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,519
into the launch so but we still needed

70
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:03,040
to test

71
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:05,120
uh this little satellite and so

72
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,480
uh we asked many people and one of those

73
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,280
those people were the

74
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,879
uh university of eff archen and they

75
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,440
said well okay

76
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:15,599
since you're the guy uh since you uh

77
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,640
also setting up a ground station we also

78
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:20,079
we have a

79
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,640
mission the compass 2 mission so we make

80
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,440
for you

81
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:25,920
the acceptance test and you will help us

82
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:29,200
to set up the ground station

83
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:30,238
and then although at that time without

84
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,798
no knowledge

85
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,400
just said okay let's do it and then we

86
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:38,560
did it

87
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:42,319
and uh now uh eight years after that

88
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:45,280
no five years after that um

89
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:46,480
uh we have now and this this team

90
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,840
consisting about

91
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:52,959
21 students first

92
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:56,159
we began with seven students

93
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:57,519
most of them were freshmen so also they

94
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:00,079
had no knowledge at all

95
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:01,840
so they had some ambition to learn

96
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,599
something about space technology and

97
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,640
maybe one day

98
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:10,000
get into space operations being space

99
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:14,079
operator or something like that

100
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:16,160
and then came this compass 2 mission

101
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,600
but the satellite never work never work

102
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,600
but we trained a lot

103
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,440
and then we decided okay now we have the

104
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:24,479
equipment we have software

105
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:28,400
most of it uh uh open source software

106
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:30,800
uh what now well let's let's let's do a

107
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,440
ground station for for others that maybe

108
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,199
have

109
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:36,000
the same problem and can find their

110
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:38,800
satellite and so on

111
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:42,800
okay so a little bit about the equipment

112
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:45,919
of the space operations facility

113
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,120
since we have practically no funding at

114
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:50,560
all

115
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,560
we make everything

116
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:58,240
with a lot of creative engagement

117
00:04:54,479 --> 00:05:01,440
and by ourselves so we have uh

118
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:04,960
we have a wonderful uh um

119
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:06,479
yagi uh array it's uh for uh

120
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,080
for the 70th centimeter it's four

121
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:11,120
clockwise polarized

122
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:14,159
18 uh crossed yagi

123
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:16,479
elements then we have uh also for the

124
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:19,840
two meter we have an array of uh

125
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:22,639
two of those antennas uh we have

126
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:24,960
uh helix antennas qualified antennas

127
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:30,240
linden blood antennas mostly done

128
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:30,239
as you can see by our own efforts

129
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:36,400
then later we get

130
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:38,400
the opportunity from another from an

131
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:42,000
high frequency institute

132
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:45,039
to get full access over

133
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:49,120
the internet to their

134
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:52,320
antenna dish which was

135
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:54,639
which is a 3 meter dish with a lock

136
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:58,479
periodic feet

137
00:05:54,639 --> 00:06:00,080
and we operate it with uh an rtl sdr

138
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:03,280
that was the first one

139
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:04,840
and later on uh they gave us the access

140
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:09,039
to a rod and schwarz

141
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:12,638
em-100 sdr

142
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:13,919
so here you see again some stuff going

143
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:15,600
on

144
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:16,960
since we are located in achen it's a

145
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,680
really rainy

146
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,000
rainy city with a lot of wind going

147
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,600
there

148
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:27,680
so we constantly have to make

149
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,680
maintenance um

150
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:34,639
and okay our radio equipment so

151
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:38,080
of course we started basically

152
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:39,039
uh with this one uh i don't know how how

153
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:42,719
much its cost is

154
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:46,400
still between 50 euros and 80 euros

155
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:51,039
and uh with the old equipment from a

156
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:55,280
mission long time ago and um

157
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:58,240
so uh for which is an icon 910

158
00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:00,080
uh which we use for all the the

159
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:03,280
satellite communications that are

160
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:06,159
uh amateur radio based but

161
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:07,198
we not only perform uh communication

162
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,080
with satellite in

163
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:11,039
the amateur radio band for example do we

164
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:14,800
also track

165
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:16,719
weather satellites and so the icom isn't

166
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:19,520
cannot do this because it's below two

167
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:23,440
meters and for for those we are very

168
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:26,719
very happy to to use these uh rtl

169
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:27,280
uh dongles and now so it's not true that

170
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,960
we get

171
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:33,119
not funded at all so we got some

172
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,880
some money from the institute which then

173
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,880
regarded oh there's something going on

174
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:39,039
here with these students and so

175
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,400
let's let's let's fund them a little bit

176
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:44,240
and so now we have an

177
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:48,000
uh uh this this week just it arrived

178
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:51,360
a new icon 9700

179
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:54,639
which can be completely operated over

180
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:56,720
overland and

181
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:58,000
we are very happy about this because our

182
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:01,039
room is located on the

183
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:04,800
second floor so we have a very long

184
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:07,120
cable uh pathways and which

185
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,120
really

186
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:15,360
sucks the the the radio signal

187
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:17,039
and uh in one mission we we realized

188
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,599
that i will come later

189
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:21,520
and so we decided okay let's bring

190
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:24,400
everything on top of the roof

191
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:26,639
and then operate uh everything uh

192
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:30,799
completely remote

193
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:35,519
okay also this teleport is already

194
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:39,519
remoted somehow here

195
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:43,360
for this m100 for example one capability

196
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:44,399
we we tried uh once to to to to make a

197
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,360
moon reflection

198
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:48,640
uh from belgium to the moon and then to

199
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:52,240
to us

200
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:55,439
at a distance at that time that was in

201
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:58,560
2018 of about

202
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:02,399
800 000 kilometers and you can

203
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:05,599
clearly see here this peak here uh

204
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:08,480
what we also do we we work

205
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,200
a lot and we are very very grateful

206
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:13,279
about this

207
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:15,839
uh with uh its operations so sometimes

208
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:17,200
we shadow track together with them the

209
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:19,519
cluster satellites

210
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,880
here for example you can really see the

211
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:23,760
cluster satellites

212
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:24,640
like like a like a cylinder with one

213
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:27,680
antenna

214
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:30,240
and it is spin stabilized so here

215
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,199
you can really uh see the rotation and

216
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,160
and you could

217
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:37,839
you you can easily calculate at which

218
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,839
rate it rotates

219
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:42,800
when we are in communication with other

220
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:46,000
teams

221
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:47,439
for example the esa or with other helm

222
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,279
radio stations

223
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,519
for which we try to get signals from

224
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:52,399
their satellite or also sometimes do

225
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:58,000
uplink

226
00:09:52,399 --> 00:10:01,200
we use mumble as a communication tool

227
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:04,640
um yes so and that is then

228
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:08,079
that this is our main room

229
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:10,240
and so actually with a

230
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:11,839
really good computer you could operate

231
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,040
all of those software with only one

232
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:16,000
computer

233
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:17,199
but since we have really old machines we

234
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,920
delocalized

235
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,600
every task on different machines and so

236
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:25,760
that's why

237
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:29,920
we wrote software that transports

238
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:34,959
the the protocols in for example to talk

239
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:37,439
with the hd high sdr

240
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:38,560
by the net using the orbiter and

241
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,680
propagator but

242
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:46,079
i i have some diagrams for this okay

243
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:47,920
so um since we said okay

244
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:50,079
we want to be a multi-mission ground

245
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:52,399
station so

246
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:53,920
we use a lot of different software

247
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:57,200
different tools

248
00:10:53,920 --> 00:11:00,240
um in order to be able to

249
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:02,399
to to to get make use of all the

250
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:06,160
protocols needed

251
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:09,440
and we are also beginning to implement

252
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:11,600
ccsds that's why we uh

253
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:13,600
we work strongly together with ether

254
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,399
they help us a little bit in order to

255
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:18,320
get

256
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:21,519
things done we use

257
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:23,120
tool and elements and now also the ccsds

258
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:26,160
oem

259
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:29,600
protocol okay

260
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:30,480
so in this really short time uh we

261
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,600
operate this

262
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:35,600
station uh we operated so

263
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,720
when i say operate that's that's that

264
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,640
that's by mean of

265
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,320
uplinking to the satellite in order to

266
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:45,040
command the satellite

267
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:48,720
uh we uh we have a good cooperation with

268
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:52,160
japan uh now ongoing

269
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:54,560
uh uh here we track either offset

270
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:56,399
but we are also experimenter on that

271
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,119
satellite it's a satellite that allows

272
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:00,800
you

273
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:05,279
to upload an experiment and then you can

274
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:07,599
somehow play with that experiment

275
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:07,600
and

276
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,320
okay is a cluster this was just a shadow

277
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,320
tracking

278
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,480
and this is all done with with students

279
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:20,000
that are in the age between

280
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:23,519
uh 18 to maybe 23

281
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:26,000
22 23 and

282
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:26,560
yeah so uh which which which performs

283
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,360
their

284
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:30,319
their bachelor thesis at the end so here

285
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,399
you see

286
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,600
uh when there is a lot of action going

287
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:35,360
on uh

288
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,040
since we have three teleports we can

289
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:40,399
really operate all three

290
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:43,519
and so all antenna at once and so

291
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:45,839
uh you need a lot of people uh

292
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:48,240
you can track a weather satellite and

293
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:48,240
also

294
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:55,920
get the signal from their argos beacon

295
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,639
uh at the same time maybe there is the

296
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:00,079
iss

297
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:03,600
passing and uh you make some digipeating

298
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:04,880
uh with that one so all all this is

299
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:08,000
possible

300
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:10,079
uh and uh in order to

301
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,279
to get the things a little bit

302
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:15,120
structured

303
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:18,480
since uh there are 21 people uh

304
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:21,760
and we really want to train them to

305
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:24,800
to to think and to to be to act like

306
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:27,200
as an operator we have also uh a

307
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,240
certification process with a recycling

308
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:31,040
process

309
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,680
so that every of them have to to perform

310
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:35,439
a minimum

311
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:37,279
of of passes per quarter in the year

312
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,560
and then they get a certification and if

313
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:40,880
they do a little bit more

314
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:43,359
they get an instructor certification so

315
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:46,880
that those guys can then instruct

316
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:51,199
the younger generation and so on um

317
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:52,800
that uh er is so we try to overcome this

318
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:55,199
problem that you always have

319
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,920
uh uh in universities as a university

320
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:57,680
teacher

321
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,279
you have a fine group of five people

322
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:01,839
that are really brilliant

323
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:02,480
and then they uh are finished with their

324
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:05,120
studies

325
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:06,880
and then it dies completely so with that

326
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:10,000
we try a little bit to

327
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:14,000
to to get the continuity in the in this

328
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:17,199
in this new thing um so

329
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,240
um this is basically not really my fault

330
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:21,519
so uh

331
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:25,440
i try to to read a little bit uh but uh

332
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:28,079
uh yeah i can understand so uh basically

333
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,600
uh uh the operation starts always with a

334
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:32,399
predictor

335
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:34,160
and then uh through some different

336
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:36,800
protocols for example for

337
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:37,600
orbitron that we use extensively which

338
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:40,880
has this

339
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:44,000
my dde wrapper then we go to the

340
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:47,360
different computers for decoding and for

341
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:50,720
uh antenna control which routes then

342
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:52,880
to to to the actual device uh which is a

343
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:55,199
for the rotorcon that's basically just a

344
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:59,040
motor that points the antenna

345
00:14:55,199 --> 00:15:02,800
or uh so so-called uh cat box

346
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:05,439
uh which uh gives the frequent uh

347
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,839
the the frequency the frequency needed

348
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,880
to

349
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:10,639
uh to the to the icom uh receiver a

350
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:12,880
transmitter

351
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:14,240
since you you have to follow the the the

352
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:17,439
frequency because

353
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:19,600
satellites are uh uh satellite signals

354
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:21,760
are subjected to to doppler shift so you

355
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:24,639
really have to follow this

356
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:25,279
and uh and and this basically for all

357
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:27,839
the

358
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:29,839
teleports that we have so we have two

359
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:32,880
teleports with rotors

360
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:35,920
and one teleport

361
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:37,279
just with uh only directional antenna

362
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:39,279
quadrifier antenna

363
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:42,560
so here you don't need the rotor but you

364
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:45,680
still need to follow the doppler shift

365
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:49,040
so here's a little bit more

366
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:52,399
concrete so this is the propagator

367
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:54,800
which calculates uh the position

368
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:56,000
of the satellite from europe from your

369
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:59,120
point of view

370
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:02,160
and then uh it transmits that with this

371
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:05,759
little application and from there

372
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:09,199
we uh designed two applications

373
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:10,639
that then uh transfer those coordinates

374
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:12,800
and the frequencies

375
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:13,839
to the to to the different rigs but not

376
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:17,199
directly

377
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:20,480
because we use a hemlib

378
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:23,599
as a as a layer in between the

379
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:26,240
hemlib is running on a linux machine

380
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,120
and that is also something we had to

381
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:31,120
learn very

382
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:32,800
with uh painful pain uh really painfully

383
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:34,399
because since we are in a university in

384
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:36,160
a structure of the university

385
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:37,680
and they make all the time updates then

386
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,439
you come one day

387
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:41,359
and then you see you see yourself your

388
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:43,839
software not working anymore

389
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:45,040
and so we decided okay let's do it in a

390
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:48,800
virtual machine

391
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:52,719
so at least uh we have a little bit of

392
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:55,279
of room left for changes uh by the it

393
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,320
so and then from there it goes down

394
00:16:55,279 --> 00:17:00,560
really to the

395
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:05,600
to to the to the desired hardware

396
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:08,639
for the um the demodulation and decoding

397
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:11,839
um we use uh for the moment sever uh

398
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:14,400
uh several several modems

399
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:16,720
uh mostly written from amateur radio

400
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,720
guys

401
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:23,039
pack uh uh rgb packet engine uh

402
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:24,000
some older uh stuff for example we use

403
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:26,400
fldg

404
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,640
there is a spanish satellite uh fossa

405
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:31,840
sat which is a really tiny satellite

406
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:35,200
uh where we use fldg to

407
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:37,280
let better say we try to use fldg

408
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,640
because we didn't get a decode of that

409
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:42,320
satellite still

410
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:45,360
um and now really new

411
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:48,720
so gnu radio is very new to us

412
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:52,399
so for us it's still experimental

413
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:54,400
uh so this will be the our is

414
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:56,080
is uh the new implement implementation

415
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:59,760
that is being installed

416
00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:03,280
but uh maybe because of a lack of

417
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:07,360
knowledge we are still not able to

418
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:10,559
to to to to use it uh fully

419
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:13,199
uh because so what we aim uh is

420
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:14,399
so what we always try is not to just

421
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,960
recur the signal

422
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:18,240
and then try to decode it afterwards so

423
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:21,039
we always try

424
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:22,400
to get it decoded as it as the pass

425
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:25,520
happens

426
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:28,559
and it works most of the time but then

427
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:30,960
i have the problem also that the student

428
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:31,840
when when when he has his past to

429
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:35,200
perform

430
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:37,840
then he prefers to use this

431
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:40,320
the stuff he knows because he can set

432
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,320
that up

433
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:44,720
without really reading the procedure

434
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:46,799
within 10 minutes

435
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:48,160
and it's really complicating then to to

436
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:50,559
implement also

437
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,440
to younger people to implement uh new

438
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:53,360
stuff like

439
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,960
new razor so but we are working hard on

440
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:57,840
it to to get that

441
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:59,600
that done so here again so this is then

442
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:02,240
the application that gets

443
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:03,840
from the propagator uh for example here

444
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:07,360
is the frequency stuff

445
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:10,399
then this is the sdr radio then we have

446
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:13,760
uh an uh freeware for

447
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:15,919
a virtual cable from where we get the

448
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,960
audio part of the signal and then he

449
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:20,080
routes that to

450
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:21,919
to the modem and that makes then a

451
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:25,439
connection to a terminal

452
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:27,919
where uh the the information

453
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:29,200
uh is then stored as a hex dumped and

454
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:33,039
after then

455
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:36,080
you can uh load that information

456
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:37,440
and get uh data that makes sense to the

457
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:39,918
human

458
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,919
um sometimes it's not so complicating

459
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:44,799
for example you have also satellites

460
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:46,000
that all have implemented all this so

461
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:48,160
you

462
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
maybe don't need the decoder because the

463
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:52,400
modem because it has the modem already

464
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:55,440
um built in

465
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:58,480
um so here is one of our

466
00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:01,919
uh first experiments

467
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:02,720
uh with uh with with new radio here we

468
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:06,159
try to

469
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:09,760
uh to to to get uh to get it run for

470
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:12,640
upset but what what we

471
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:13,200
really want to do is we want to use this

472
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:16,080
one

473
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,400
because we have now a new problem that

474
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:20,960
come

475
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:21,760
came up since one year ago with rtl

476
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:25,039
dongle we

477
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:27,200
really could easily uh receive signals

478
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:30,879
in the 70 centimeter bond but now

479
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:34,480
it's so totally uh um

480
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:38,080
full of stuff in there that uh

481
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:41,280
often so here was the big beacon of the

482
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:44,000
of of offset but then came this big

483
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:45,600
uh so this big disturbing digital signal

484
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,559
i don't know what it is

485
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:50,719
and then you you can get any decodes but

486
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:53,840
when we use the icon

487
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:56,400
uh the the conventional transceiver

488
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:57,439
we can we can get it very well uh for

489
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:00,640
example

490
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:03,840
uh using sdr

491
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:07,280
and this this new radio application

492
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:10,879
uh uses directly the sdr um

493
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:12,240
uh we were we were able to get for a

494
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,120
really good pass because they are good

495
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:15,280
passes and they are

496
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:17,120
not so good passes a good part is often

497
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:20,399
a path with a high elevation

498
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:21,199
we get five packets and if you use the

499
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:24,080
icon

500
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,880
without anything for a very very very

501
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:29,120
bad pass

502
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:30,799
we get at least 35 33 packets

503
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:33,120
so and that is really a problem so we

504
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:36,480
really hope that we can

505
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:37,199
get the iaf of this new icon get it work

506
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:40,480
and connect it

507
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:44,640
into the new radio so that we can really

508
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:47,440
uh use the full power of the system

509
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,919
uh so that is for the moment uh let's

510
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,640
say

511
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:51,600
the cheap setup that we use for for that

512
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,679
uh as i i

513
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:55,678
explained it already here you see but

514
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:59,679
that was with the icom

515
00:21:55,679 --> 00:22:03,840
a lot of packets for a pass

516
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:06,880
with an elevation of below 30 degrees

517
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:10,158
um what still really

518
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:13,919
works well with the cheap

519
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:15,919
sdr radio dongle is a weather satellite

520
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:17,760
on the on the sub 2 meter band

521
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:20,000
because that's obviously not in the

522
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:23,280
amateur radio band anymore it's below of

523
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:26,000
that 2 meter amateur radio band so here

524
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:27,678
even if it's a low elevation because we

525
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,799
have the strong antenna

526
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:32,640
we really can get

527
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:34,480
weather satellite images from one

528
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:38,080
horizon to the other horizon

529
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:40,720
so it starts at about three degree

530
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:41,280
to four degree elevation right then to

531
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,120
the other

532
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:45,039
three to get four degrees so we get

533
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:49,039
really an image from you have

534
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:51,600
uh uh parts of africa and you have also

535
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:52,320
you can also have parts of the green and

536
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:56,480
ice sheets

537
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:56,480
all in one image which is really awesome

538
00:22:56,799 --> 00:23:02,400
so for the uplinking

539
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:04,240
it's a little bit the same thing uh for

540
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:07,919
the moment we

541
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:10,400
we we use this easy

542
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:11,280
term and then we go again via sound

543
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:14,080
modem

544
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:15,120
and we hope that also here we one day we

545
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:17,918
will be able to

546
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:18,639
to to fully use new radio because we

547
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:21,679
really

548
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:22,000
farm we really want to to get rid of all

549
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:23,919
these

550
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,440
stuff where you have different modems

551
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:28,559
that you have to use

552
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:32,880
and uh to to fully enjoy

553
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:36,158
daniel estevez uh here are satellites

554
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:39,039
because we think that that would

555
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:39,520
make our life a lot more easier at the

556
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:42,559
end

557
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:44,799
maybe with a lot of for work but then

558
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:46,879
once the system would then run

559
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:48,400
i think it would get a lot more a lot

560
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:51,440
more easy

561
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:55,279
so this for example uh was

562
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:55,679
using the icom uh was an sstv image that

563
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:59,279
we

564
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:59,600
um i think this one was not yesterday

565
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:02,480
but

566
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:04,240
on friday uh so we we get really high

567
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:07,200
quality images

568
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:08,480
with our antenna setup and that is done

569
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:11,679
with the sdr

570
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:15,440
so you really see that's the same path

571
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:18,880
uh almost the same elevation

572
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:22,000
and you really see a big difference

573
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:25,840
what we also really like to do is

574
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:29,039
we follow the the soyuz

575
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:31,918
and we are very lucky because

576
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:32,799
soyuz only communicates in that region

577
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:35,679
and for the rest

578
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:36,559
they don't talk at all so as soon as

579
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:38,720
they

580
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:40,080
they can physically have a connection

581
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:42,880
with soup

582
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:44,320
in moscow they start talking talking

583
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,279
talking talking talking talking all the

584
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:47,360
time is very

585
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:48,799
uh very interesting all in russian but

586
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:51,760
it's really amazing for

587
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:53,918
for young students to to hear the

588
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:58,240
commander in russian speak to

589
00:24:53,919 --> 00:25:00,240
mission control moscow okay uh

590
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:02,320
here that was where the first time where

591
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:04,559
we we really got aware about the problem

592
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:06,720
that we are sitting in the second floor

593
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:07,918
and uh our antennas are on the fifth

594
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:11,360
floor uh

595
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:12,559
so we we tried hard hard hard to to to

596
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:16,080
to get any

597
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:19,200
any of those uh tiny beacons when we

598
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:20,240
we got it one or two beacons after weeks

599
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:24,000
of work

600
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:28,000
and then we discovered web sdr

601
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:30,799
a very wonderful uh uh

602
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,279
tool so that's a receiver you just log

603
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:34,400
on

604
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:34,960
via the internet then you connect your

605
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:38,320
modem

606
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:40,880
and you you finally can can

607
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:42,960
understand the signals coming from that

608
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:45,760
tiny satellite that orbited

609
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,760
around the moon

610
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:51,679
um and then because we really tried to

611
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:53,200
to to get it also by our own i

612
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:56,000
discovered also this nice

613
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:57,520
sheet from daniel estevez and i got the

614
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:01,520
idea oh my god

615
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:02,799
maybe if we really point it it said that

616
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:04,879
it does not make the difference but

617
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:07,039
maybe small difference could

618
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:08,240
uh could change the game so then i

619
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:10,799
divert i

620
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:11,840
i took the the book of david vallado

621
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:15,440
with the students

622
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:19,279
uh uh we implemented inside of gmat

623
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:21,200
then a function that uh calculates

624
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:22,480
because gmat can cannot do that that's

625
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:25,520
an an

626
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:28,000
orbital simulation but we needed to get

627
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:28,960
the azimuth in elevation to point the

628
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,000
antenna

629
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:34,000
and so we uh we used this algorithm

630
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,039
from that book and then we wrote a

631
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:39,039
program so

632
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:41,840
so then the gmat and writes down a file

633
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:43,279
with all the positions so we we took the

634
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:46,080
state vectors then from the

635
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:48,240
from the chinese guy uh from the uh from

636
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:49,360
the university of harveyan or was it was

637
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:52,559
it your

638
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:57,199
uh you also had it on on your guitar

639
00:26:52,559 --> 00:27:06,559
and then we so this program just read it

640
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:08,640
uh read it that okay type this up

641
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:08,639
you
