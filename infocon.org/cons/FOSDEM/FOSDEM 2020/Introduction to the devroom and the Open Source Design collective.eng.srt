so um who

6
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:22,720
is familiar with open source design

7
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:26,640
okay so a few people know most people

8
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:30,960

uh so i'd like to welcome you to uh the

14
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,719
open source design devroom uh this is

15
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:47,360
our sixth year

16
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:48,399
surprise surprisingly for us um we've

17
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,519
managed to get this

18
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:52,719
uh organized um and

19
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,120
we'd like to give you just a really

20
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:58,480
short introduction to what and who

21
00:00:55,120 --> 00:01:01,760
open source design and collective is

22
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:03,120
um and during during the day sometime

23
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,530
today we'd like to get like a

24
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:08,689
a big group photo um

25
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:08,689
[Music]

26
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:13,840
okay uh because

27
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:15,280
every year we kind of put a photo

28
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,520
together just to say you know

29
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,799
who we are so this was taken last year

30
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,200
in the dev room

31
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:22,080
um this is about a third of the people

32
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,439
that were there

33
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,679
just in terms of you know people coming

34
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:28,399
and going we're always

35
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,000
reasonably full devroom which i think is

36
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:33,280
a is a is a good

37
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:37,360
indication um we're a collective of

38
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:38,880
um ux designers um

39
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:42,159
designers graphic designers visual

40
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:44,399
designers user researchers

41
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:46,399
who advocate for more user-centered

42
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:48,800
design

43
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:50,479
processes and methods in

44
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:53,520
[Music]

45
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:56,560
the design of open source software

46
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:58,399
we started in kind of late 2014

47
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:01,040
and every year we've been kind of

48
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:04,320
growing uh

49
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:05,600
a lot so what is the purpose of open

50
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,959
source design well we've got

51
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:12,879
sort of seven goals that we're trying to

52
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:14,720
you know achieve slowly but surely um

53
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:16,720
you can read what these are i'm going to

54
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,959
go through sort of some of them how we

55
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:23,200
actually put these goals into practice

56
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:24,879
um we're a small collective of core

57
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,200
people who are trying to do this so you

58
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:27,440
know

59
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,200
everybody is welcome to contribute and

60
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,599
if you've got one of these goals

61
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,359
you'd like to sort of you know champion

62
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:36,959
you're you're very welcome

63
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:41,120
to uh to do that

64
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:45,920
so in terms of

65
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:49,280
in terms of the second one

66
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:51,359
make designers contributors um that's

67
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:54,640
the wrong

68
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:57,599
that's the wrong one but anyway um

69
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,238
we run um a jobs board and we host uh

70
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:01,440
java

71
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:01,920
job advertisements uh for free so this

72
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,319
is for

73
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:06,319
open source projects who are looking for

74
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:10,480
designers to take part in

75
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:14,480
in the design of the software

76
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:16,079
all we ask is that the job must be

77
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,760
related to an open source project it can

78
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,800
be from a company it can be from a

79
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:22,159
project

80
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:25,599
it can be paid unpaid

81
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:29,280
contribution it's open

82
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:31,599
so the the project can post a job

83
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,519
explain what they're looking for and

84
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:36,238
then it goes out to

85
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:37,519
it goes on to our website we publicize

86
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:41,360
it on twitter mastodon

87
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:43,200
etc over the years we've got

88
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,959
quite a good number of jobs from from

89
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:48,159
both small projects to

90
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:51,760
large organizations um

91
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:55,760
last year one was from passport

92
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:58,879
the collaborative password manager

93
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:02,319
where they hired a designer from

94
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:05,760
the open source design website

95
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:09,280
um which was a good i think a good thing

96
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:12,640
um we also um try to provide

97
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:14,400
a community for for designers who either

98
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,159
sort of know what's involved in open

99
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,600
source are or don't know what's involved

100
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,000
in open source and are looking for like

101
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,840
a

102
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,000
easy way in um a lot of it is

103
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:24,880
you know sort of sharing our experience

104
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,639
sharing our

105
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:32,000
expertise um about

106
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:32,560
open source um this can be about um ux

107
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,160
methods

108
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,840
particular methods that work really well

109
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,360
in open source or

110
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:40,159
methods that don't work well in open

111
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:42,240
source um how to get

112
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,919
involvement from from the community both

113
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,199
in terms of the contributors who are

114
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:48,799
making the software

115
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:51,360
writing code and from users uh because

116
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,400
in comparison to you know more

117
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,520
commercial

118
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,719
uh ux work you're you're you're dealing

119
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,159
with a community of

120
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,400
already existing people and it's

121
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,360
important not to you know alienate those

122
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:05,520
people

123
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:08,639
um we run a bunch of repos

124
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:11,320
uh with um articles um

125
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:13,919
articles that we've written um

126
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:17,199
conferences that we've attended

127
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:20,479
um you know just sharing the

128
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:22,400
the knowledge that we've managed to

129
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:23,520
to put together ah this is this is

130
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:27,120
completely out of

131
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:30,240
others think so jobs boards as i said um

132
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,880
here's here's some of the jobs um yeah

133
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,080
from scrap

134
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:38,000
from scribus um the

135
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:41,039

what is open source

154
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,440
um and how it it's a little bit

00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:24,080
um we're affiliated with

173
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,599
the open source initiative free software

174
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,520
foundation europe

175
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:29,680
also eff this is really important

176
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:32,159
because it allows us to

177
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,800
basically bang the very big drum about

178
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,160
design

179
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:40,160
and user center design and usability in

180
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:42,840
um organizations that have predominantly

181
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,639
been about technical about you know code

182
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:46,400
contributions um

183
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,840
so sorry but surely we're getting

184
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,560
traction they're understanding the

185
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:51,679
importance

186
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:55,120
of of design uh

187
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:58,160
in uh in open source software um

188
00:07:55,120 --> 00:08:01,520
the our affiliation with eff

189
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:02,400
is around usability and security and

190
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:05,758
privacy

191
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:08,239
um the eff advocate for a lot of

192
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:09,360
use of open source software for people

193
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,319
who have

194
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:14,319
you know certain security needs as we

195
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:17,360
all know a lot of that software is

196
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:19,199
difficult to use people are now

197
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,039
starting to see the importance of well

198
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,639
if you want to keep your users safe

199
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:24,318
they also need to understand what they

200
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:27,039
have to do what happens when

201
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:27,919
the software goes wrong and trying to

202
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:31,440
reduce that

203
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:34,799
that usability barrier um

204
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:37,120
we have one two three six

205
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:38,478
eight meetups some are very active some

206
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,640
are not so active

207
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:42,399
uh and yeah this is a little bit of a

208
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:45,360
strange kind of uh

209
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:45,839
layout of my word cloud so it's boston

210
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,720
uh

211
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:50,640
portland denver bangalore freiburg in

212
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,760
germany san francisco brasilia and

213
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:54,720
madrid

214
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:55,680
if you're interested in running a local

215
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,959
meetup

216
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,479
you don't have to ask for permission you

217
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:59,518
have to ask for anything just you know

218
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:02,480
go and do it

219
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:03,360
we have a section on our discourse all

220
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,399
about

221
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:08,800
local meetups um it's

222
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:10,399
it's basically to try and you know again

223
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,959
get the word about

224
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:13,680
uh user center design and design it in

225
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:17,040
open source

226
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:20,160
software um

227
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:22,480
that's about it we do have a

228
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,600
open collective uh we have the grand

229
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:27,040
total of one thousand

230
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:30,399
five hundred and seventeen dollars which

231
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:33,519
uh yeah uh you know

232
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:36,399

um that's very quick and very short uh

236
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:43,720
if you want to

237
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:45,040
get involved easiest thing is to go to

238
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:48,880
discourse.opensourcedesign.net

239
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:53,120
we have a nice welcoming

240
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:56,560

you know so if there's a certain thing

246

that you'd like to get

247
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:12,000
um you're a designer who wants to know

248
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,719
more about

249
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,680
usability or you're a user researcher

250
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:19,040
who wants to know

251
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:19,599
more about design or you're a designer

252
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,920
and you know

253
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,600
nothing about open source software and

254
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:26,880
you want to know how to

255
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:28,959
or where i should uh you know start

256
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,720
we we answer you know every kind of

257
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:32,640
question um

258
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,760
one of the things we're trying to kind

259
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:36,319
of do

260
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:37,200
uh a lot of is go and talk to university

261
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,040
students

262
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,240
who are sort of starting on their you

263
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:43,279
know design

264
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:46,000
career um and before

265
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:47,439
the adobes and the you know the other

266
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,880
people kind of get their hooks into them

267
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,079
we're trying to say you know hey there's

268
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,720
a lot of other software

269
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:54,079
that is maybe not as good but but

270
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:58,839
there's no reason why

271
00:10:54,079 --> 00:11:02,079
it cannot be as good um come on in

272
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:04,640
um and basically you know

273
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:05,359
show them about a different type of of

274
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:07,839
design

275
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:09,600
i think a lot of designers are starting

276
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:12,640
to you know be more aware

277
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:14,959
of thankfully of ethics and privacy and

278
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:17,600
security and it's not about you know

279
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:18,160
conversion of clicks and it's not about

280
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,240
you know

281
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:21,600
all of these kind of things um exposing

282
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,720
you know what's going on in certain

283
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,920
algorithms

284
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:28,959
and while that's not our exact focus

285
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,360
you know that is that is certainly

286
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:30,959
something

287
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,360
that is built on top of open source

288
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:35,839
software um

289
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,600
so the other thing yeah we have our

290
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:42,000
wonderful twitter you know uh

291
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:45,279
where we uh we post the jobs that we um

292
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,519
that we get um and yeah

293
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:48,480
i mean we're reasonably reasonably

294
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:51,600
active there

295
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:55,120
and that is it so

296
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:56,079
uh a reasonably quick sort of whirlwind

297
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:59,519
tour through

298
00:11:56,079 --> 00:12:03,760
open source design so we have

299
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:07,519
um no that's uh that's something else

300
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:10,560
we have our first talk at 10

301
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:14,000
uh we have like 13 minutes

302
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:15,439
for any questions or i'd also like to

303
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,120
understand and know a little bit about

304
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,800
who's here um

305
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,399
i don't need to know everything about

306
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,120
you but if you want to say sort of you

307
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:25,200
know

308
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:28,399
um what you do or what you identify as

309
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:30,240
in terms yeah come on in okay or not

emma you a cuban sir hey i'm amit i work

331
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:26,079
as a computational designer

332
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,279
so i'm working with architects or to

333
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:29,680
come up with like

334
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:31,120
geometry and fabrication and different

335
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:33,599
design processes

336
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,480
and that's like a big chunk of my work

337
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,720
and i've been

338
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,519
exploring a lot into like vr and other

339
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,079
sort of

340
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:42,079
technologies to give like a 3d

341
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:43,519
