1
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:10,800
i may introduce you

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:14,240
warner losh he's now working for netflix

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:16,880
though what we hear from him is not

4
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,680
anything about video but about unix

5
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:21,038
history

6
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:24,240
and some more unix history

7
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:26,800
things uh which are not multics coming

8
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:29,119
to unix which we probably all know

9
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,720
so we'll hear maybe things we didn't

10
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:33,040
know before

11
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,150
thank you very much and let's go i think

12
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:41,600
all right thank you

13
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:44,399
[Applause]

14
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,039
last year euronyx turned 50 years old

15
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:48,079
and

16
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:48,640
in celebration of that a lot of people

17
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:52,399
gave

18
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:55,760
history of unix talks that

19
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:58,000
ranged from very interesting to not not

20
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:00,000
maybe so interesting um how many people

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,800
here saw one of those talks

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,720
and okay how many people gave one of

23
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:08,560
those talks

24
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:08,560
me too so

25
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:12,720
the talk generally can be boiled down

26
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:16,320
into about three slides

27
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,759
a t got into multix which was supposed

28
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:21,039
to be this great singing

29
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:23,280
all dancing advanced computer system

30
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:25,680
and after five years of poor progress

31
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,320
they left the multix project

32
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,840
after they left the multix project ken

33
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,839
thompson and dennis ritchie

34
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,200
didn't know what to do so ken found an

35
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,840
old pdp-7

36
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,280
and wrote unix for it this gave them the

37
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:40,000
credibility to

38
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:42,399
make the patent office buy them a pdp-11

39
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,640
so they could port unix to that

40
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:46,240
a few years later they rewrote they got

41
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,720
tired of rewriting it in assembler so

42
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:52,000
they rewrote it in c

43
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:53,840
and a few years after that unix got set

44
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,600
free into the world everybody was using

45
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,840
unix as of the

46
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,439
sixth edition and with the seventh

47
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,759
edition it totally exploded

48
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:04,880
this is where all the adaptation

49
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:08,399
happened this is where berkeley forked

50
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:11,599
their version in fact we had a fork

51
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:14,160
of unix where system 5

52
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:16,319
went commercial and bsd out of

53
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:18,160
networking and we had all the eunuchs

54
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:21,519
wars of the 80s

55
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:23,520
and in the 90s we had

56
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,599
gave rise to linux because everybody

57
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,040
else was fighting or whatever reason

58
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:30,160
there's usually people offered

59
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:32,079
different opinions this gives kind of a

60
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,799
simplified family tree that looks like

61
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,560
this

62
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,080
i put this up here because i'll refer to

63
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,599
some of these later things

64
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,200
in the rest of my talk and i want you

65
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:41,760
guys to know where they're at

66
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:43,040
uh this also shows that oftentimes

67
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,160
people giving these talks have their own

68
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,760
agenda

69
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,760
i'm on the freebsd core team so of

70
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,799
course i put freebsd up here but none of

71
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:53,280
the other bsds

72
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:55,440
sorry guys but today's talk will be

73
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,400
just in the early part of this family

74
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,640
tree

75
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,560
where things really got going and a lot

76
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:02,480
of really cool things happened

77
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,920
that when i talked to other people about

78
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,119
it they didn't know so i thought i'd put

79
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:08,720
a talk together

80
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,720
so i can share it with people

81
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:14,640
before i get going i want to give a

82
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:16,319
shout out to the unix historic society

83
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,079
you'll hear me talk about twos this and

84
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:20,799
twos that later in the talk

85
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,879
that's the unix historic society and

86
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:25,519
what they've done for the last 20 years

87
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:26,239
is they've gone around and and gotten as

88
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:28,720
many

89
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:29,519
artifacts as they can from the history

90
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:32,480
of unix

91
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:34,319
a lot of them are binary artifacts some

92
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,840
of them are incomplete

93
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:37,518
another thing that they've done is

94
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,640
different subgroups have gone off

95
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:41,599
and taken the incomplete artifacts and

96
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,119
done some

97
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:44,640
i guess you might call it restoration

98
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,599
work to

99
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:49,440
allow you to run early versions of unix

100
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:52,720
or

101
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:54,319
explore uh what was what should have

102
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,720
been on this tape if we had the tape but

103
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:56,000
we

104
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,159
pieced it together from all these other

105
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,439
places

106
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:01,920
the other people i want to give a shout

107
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:05,200
out to is bit savers

108
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,839
uh al caso started this about 20 years

109
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:09,760
ago

110
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:13,840
to preserve unix and more generally

111
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:16,159
any electronic technology documentation

112
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:20,560
he set up a scanning station if you go

113
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,560
and look at his site he has a big long

114
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:25,040
presentation about how he scans

115
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,560
everything he's currently working out of

116
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,080
the computer history museum

117
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,240
in mountain view so if you donate your

118
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:33,680
documentation

119
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,680
you might actually get a

120
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,159
tax deduction in your depending on what

121
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,240
the laws of your country are

122
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,360
and these days he also accepts people

123
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,199
that have scanned in

124
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,600
documents and he'll put them up on his

125
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:47,520
website and he's been very instrumental

126
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,120
in preserving a lot of the documentation

127
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,198
from the early machine so people can

128
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,639
write emulators for them

129
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:54,479
which is very important if you want to

130
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:57,840
run early linux most people don't have a

131
00:04:54,479 --> 00:05:01,120
pdp 7 or a pdp-11 in their back pocket

132
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:03,599
and this work allows those emulators to

133
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,360
be created

134
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,440
and when i gave this talk to a friend he

135
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:10,080
said nobody's going to know who at t

136
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,360
is in europe at t is the phone company

137
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,919
in the united states

138
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,840
it was founded by alexander graham bell

139
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:17,680
and so you'll hear me talk about bell

140
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:21,039
this bell that the bell system

141
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:23,680
was the entire um group of companies

142
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:25,120
that were the phone company and bell

143
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,280
labs was the

144
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,120
premier research institution that was

145
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:31,840
part of that

146
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:34,560
another thing you should know is in 1956

147
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:36,479
they signed a consent decree

148
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,919
because they had a telephone monopoly

149
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:39,680
that basically said we won't use our

150
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:41,440
telephone monopoly to branch out into

151
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:45,919
other markets

152
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:48,479
uh the other thing in 1982

153
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:49,599
that was thrown out and att was broken

154
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:52,000
up but let

155
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:54,240
that let them start aggressively

156
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:58,000
marketing unix

157
00:05:54,240 --> 00:06:00,319
and monetizing it which

158
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,440
is actually the era beyond this talk but

159
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:03,840
it's

160
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:07,360
parts of it impinge on this talk so you

161
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:12,400
might need to know that for later

162
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:14,160
so in the standard history i said that

163
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,758
ken thompson found a pdp-7 but what's a

164
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:20,000
pdp-7

165
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:21,680
it's a mini-computer that

166
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,520
digital equipment corporation dec

167
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:26,800
produced um in the

168
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:29,198
60s and 70s and it was one of a line of

169
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:31,680
18-bit computers now 18-bit sounds kind

170
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:32,639
of weird we're used to 16 or 32 or 64

171
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,319
bits

172
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:36,400
but at the time deck came out with this

173
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:38,960
all the mainframes were 36 bits

174
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,638
so 18 made sense it was like half a

175
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:43,919
mainframe or something kind of in the

176
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:45,680
in the thinking of the time and these

177
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:47,758
were huge machines you know

178
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,120
this tall big as a refrigerator here's a

179
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:52,800
picture of one of them being

180
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,800
delivered to the university of stockholm

181
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,880
and here's a a nice steadily staged

182
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:58,880
photo of one

183
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,400
most of the pdp sevens when they were in

184
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:03,520
use didn't look anything

185
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:07,039
like that they were quite a bit messier

186
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:10,000
so the bit i set up where

187
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:11,360
ken thompson found a pdp-7 because he

188
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,560
was disillusioned

189
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,120
from the multix project being canceled

190
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,000
just

191
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,479
not entirely correct um he played this

192
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,880
game

193
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:22,639
called space travel you'll see the

194
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,639
screenshot up here it's the only

195
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:26,319
screenshot we have of space travel

196
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:29,039
and nobody knows what it means but every

197
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:31,520
talk seems to include it so i had to

198
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:32,639
um but he he was playing on their

199
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,318
mainframe

200
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:36,080
and in those days mainframes were

201
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:37,440
frightfully expensive and they charged a

202
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:40,000
lot of money just for a little bit of

203
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,880
cpu time and each game cost 50 60 70

204
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,599
bucks

205
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:45,440
to play and yeah it was funny bologna

206
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:47,120
lab money but a report went to his

207
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,680
manager and he didn't want to have that

208
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,360
happen

209
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,879
wouldn't be talked to about wasting time

210
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,960
on the mainframe

211
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:55,120
so he scrounged around and one of the

212
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:57,520
departments that sat near them

213
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:59,280
at murray hill was the visual and

214
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:03,198
acoustics department

215
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:03,840
and they had a pdp-7 that they had used

216
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:07,440
for

217
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:09,758
some computer music and sensory

218
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:11,039
research psychology psychology of sound

219
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:12,639
research that they had done

220
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:14,878
but they were done with it they were

221
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:16,400
kind of the darling of the labs and got

222
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:17,680
all this money so they went from machine

223
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:20,400
to machine to machine and this one was

224
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:24,560
one of the leftovers

225
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:27,840
so ken rewrote space travel in

226
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,560
pdp 7 assembler um loaded it onto paper

227
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,799
tape

228
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,479
um ran it over to the pdp-7 and loaded

229
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,760
it on a machine like this and would play

230
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:37,360
his games

231
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:39,039
and that was fine as far as it went but

232
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,360
he kept finding bugs in it and kept

233
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:44,880
wanting to

234
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:49,040
improve it so they had

235
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:52,640
at the labs designed a system

236
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:54,480
they had designed a system up

237
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:56,240
on paper that nobody had implemented yet

238
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,279
so he went about implementing it with

239
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,600
dennis ritchie

240
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:00,640
uh so that he could play this game

241
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:04,560
better but what they

242
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:07,439
wound up with was um unix

243
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,079
um ken also started writing a fortran

244
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,399
compiler

245
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,680
because um the original space travel

246
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,800
game was in fortran he thought he could

247
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,399
just bring it over

248
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:17,040
but that didn't go very well and he

249
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:19,279
wound up with a language called b

250
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,319
which evolved into newbie and then into

251
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:23,040
c which is

252
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,720
what they would later rewrite unix in i

253
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:28,959
could do a whole talk on that

254
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,959
progression but my time here is short

255
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,360
so pdp seven unix is largely a footnote

256
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:38,240
in history nobody uses it today nobody

257
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:41,279
knows about it today except maybe

258
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:43,600
you know a quick question to a trivia or

259
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:46,240
an answer to a trivia question

260
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,959
but it was very important in building

261
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,959
credibility

262
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:50,640
for this group at bell labs they had

263
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:52,640
just had

264
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,160
spent five years with a failure in

265
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:56,480
multix and they needed

266
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,920
some wind they could show so they were

267
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,839
able to use

268
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:01,040
the pdp-7 show it to people show how

269
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:03,200
useful it was

270
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,079
and were able to get the patent

271
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:08,079
department

272
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:09,519
to buy them pdp 11 to port unix 2.

273
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:11,120
for a long time it was believed the

274
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:13,920
sources were lost to history there's no

275
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:16,800
binary artifacts from this time

276
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:19,199
nothing really survived but there's been

277
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:22,959
a few recent discoveries

278
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,680
um in 2011 uh robert morris senior

279
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:26,479
passed away

280
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:29,040
now he was a security researcher at bell

281
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:31,120
labs in the 60s 70s and 80s

282
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,399
and he did a lot of security things on

283
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,800
unix probably the one you're most

284
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:37,600
familiar with is etsy password

285
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:39,359
um and when he passed away he had a huge

286
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,120
collection of papers that took a long

287
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,920
time to go through

288
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:45,279
so his um estate asked doug mcilroy who

289
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,959
is another

290
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:48,640
person from bell labs to go through the

291
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:50,239
papers and and sort out the ones of

292
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:53,279
historical relevance

293
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:55,040
and he found uh some a paper that

294
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:58,320
described the pdp

295
00:10:55,040 --> 00:11:00,319
um seven units in pdp 11 unix

296
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,079
now there's no date on this paper but

297
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:06,000
from the internal

298
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:07,680
uh references in here that the pdp-7 has

299
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,279
been running for a year the pdp-11 just

300
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,719
started we know that this room is from

301
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:12,079
71.

302
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,160
and if you take the time to read through

303
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:14,719
this paper it looks a lot like the later

304
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:18,880
papers

305
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:20,880
that describe the architecture of unix

306
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:22,959
and i'll talk about those in a minute

307
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:25,279
but we have more to discover on the pdp

308
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:25,279
seven

309
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:31,839
the next year in 2016 um

310
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:34,319
norm wilson was going through his garage

311
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:36,079
and found this notebook of unix source

312
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,360
that he had copied while he worked at

313
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:40,839
bell labs

314
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:42,160
and it turns out that it was the pdp

315
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:45,279
seven

316
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:46,399
listing and the user utilities a through

317
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:50,560
f

318
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:52,399
uh so a group that with a twos group

319
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:54,479
typed this all in because you might

320
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:56,320
think this would work to ocr

321
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,760
but when you oc ocr rn you get all kinds

322
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,279
of errors and you have to recheck it

323
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,399
anyway so it's faster just to type it

324
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:02,079
all in

325
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:05,279
so they typed it all in and created an

326
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:08,319
image and enhanced simh

327
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:10,560
simulator to run it and now you can run

328
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:13,200
pdp seven unix

329
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:14,560
i have a link to the github if you'd

330
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,720
like to

331
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:18,079
check this out after my talk there's a

332
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:21,120
link to my talk

333
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:22,839
slides from the conference website or

334
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:25,680
there should be i put it in what pinto

335
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:27,680
barf

336
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,760
and for a while we thought okay we'll

337
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,920
have to be happy with just half a system

338
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:33,439
but this past summer um the computer

339
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:36,719
history museum in honor

340
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:38,160
of the 50th anniversary of unix

341
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,760
found the other half of the notebook it

342
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:43,519
turns out there were two books that

343
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:45,200
were in the unix room at bell labs and

344
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:47,200
dennis ritchie wound up with the second

345
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:49,440
one and it was in his estate

346
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:51,040
and so they scanned all of it in and the

347
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:53,600
two folks jumped back in

348
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:56,079
and grabbed everything and this time

349
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:58,560
there was uh space travel sources

350
00:12:56,079 --> 00:13:00,880
i'll get i'll get to what happened with

351
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:02,079
those here in a minute

352
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,480
and the other thing that happened this

353
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:06,479
summer is the living history

354
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,600
computer the living computer history

355
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:10,639
museum in

356
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,120
seattle washington uh had restored a pdp

357
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:13,200
7

358
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:15,279
that had been donated to them and they

359
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,160
got unix running on it they took the two

360
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:19,279
sources

361
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:20,719
and booted it

362
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:23,439
i thought i'd share a little bit here

363
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:25,120
this is the uh front panel console with

364
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:28,000
all the blinking lights

365
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,720
and um unix just booted you just see the

366
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,399
question mark

367
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,839
now a lot of people say no that couldn't

368
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:33,360
possibly be

369
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:35,600
every single unix system i've ever

370
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:38,240
logged into is unbearably chatty

371
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:40,399
well it started from here and got worse

372
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,399
so

373
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:46,399
in fact if you go back in the some of

374
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:48,880
the user

375
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:50,639
newsletters um people were very angry

376
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:53,439
when they added the prints

377
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:54,399
for uh restricted rights for uh western

378
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:58,560
digital

379
00:13:54,399 --> 00:14:00,160
so it's been a long battle

380
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,439
so what do we know from all of these

381
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:03,040
cool things that have happened in the

382
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,040
past couple of years

383
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:06,399
well we're able to get a very good

384
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,839
picture of

385
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:11,199
all the components that were in the

386
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:13,120
system and we can take that knowledge

387
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:16,000
that there was a light pin and a certain

388
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:20,240
type of deck display and a custom

389
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:23,519
graphics device an early gpu

390
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:23,760
and in a lot of ways and we can combine

391
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:26,639
it

392
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:27,439
with this listing we have of all the com

393
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:29,760
of all the

394
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,880
18-bit deck computers why do we have

395
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:33,600
this listing well

396
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:35,439
another pack rat whose name i forgot to

397
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:38,079
include in this

398
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,959
had this listing on green bar paper in

399
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:40,560
his garage

400
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:42,000
and scanned them in and uploaded it to

401
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:44,160
bitkeepers so we're able to

402
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,560
look at that and see who had what

403
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:49,040
equipment deck field service

404
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:50,638
took very meticulous notes and kept very

405
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,920
good records of all of the systems that

406
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:54,480
they had

407
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:56,160
so from all of this um we can figure out

408
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,519
what the machine is now i have a blog

409
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,079
entry here it's probably too small to

410
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:59,839
read

411
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:01,519
but if you want to go read all of the

412
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:04,480
details that i don't have time to

413
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:06,720
go into uh we'll know that this that his

414
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:09,040
ken's discarded pdp 7 was serial number

415
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:12,240
34

416
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:16,399
and it had these components on it uh

417
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:19,760
including um the rc09 disk

418
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:21,600
which was retrofitted from the pdp-9s

419
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:23,040
which meant when ken wrote the system

420
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,880
the only pdp

421
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:28,480
seven that could run it was the one they

422
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:32,160
had it was completely unique

423
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:33,440
also in 1965 prices this is a quarter

424
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:37,439
million dollar machine

425
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,440
so very expensive machine

426
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:42,560
there's one other thing i have a photo

427
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:44,880
here from a sales catalog it's similar

428
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:47,040
to the other photos i've shown

429
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:48,800
and i have a still frame from that video

430
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:51,040
i showed you it's called the incredible

431
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:56,319
machine and it was produced by bell labs

432
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:59,599
in 1969 and if you look closely

433
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:02,480
you can see the different

434
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:04,639
components line up the status lights

435
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:08,160
from the memory bank

436
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:10,880
is the first arrow but we see the

437
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:12,719
paper tape machine and the console that

438
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:15,759
you also saw when i showed you the

439
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:18,320
film booting unix so

440
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:20,079
um again if we go and look at the

441
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:22,240
history and look at what machines this

442
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:23,359
could possibly be the only machine this

443
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,279
could possibly be

444
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:27,199
is the one that wound up in the scrap

445
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:29,040
heap that ken thompson

446
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:30,560
later used to run unix which is pretty

447
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:34,880
cool

448
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:37,599
so um i thought i'd show a couple more

449
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:38,720
seconds of this you can see the machine

450
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,160
there in the background

451
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,000
these guys are talking about making

452
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:43,600
computer music

453
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,959
in the last talk i couldn't have sound

454
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,560
and it's probably better because the

455
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:49,119
music is very

456
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:50,800
harsh to our ears but it kind of shows

457
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:54,079
the technology that um

458
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:56,079
ken was working on um when he did this

459
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:58,079
the bad news is there's still no space

460
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:58,800
travel now i had this as a separate

461
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:00,959
slide

462
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:02,079
hoping against hope that somebody the

463
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:03,119
days before the conference would

464
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:04,559
announce oh yeah

465
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:07,039
here's space travel and here's how you

466
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:11,359
play it and stuff but

467
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:13,760
no luck um the problem is that since the

468
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:14,399
graphics display or the graphics 2

469
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,000
display

470
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:18,240
that it was written for was kind of like

471
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,640
an early gpu you would send it

472
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:21,280
basically machine code to run to do the

473
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,439
display

474
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:24,799
and some of the op codes in that machine

475
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:26,959
code

476
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:28,799
aren't documented and they're still

477
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:33,840
trying to puzzle out

478
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:33,840
what's going on with that

479
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:36,320
so once

480
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:42,640
so moving on to the pdp-11 era

481
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:44,400
this was a much cheaper machine it was a

482
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:46,559
16-bit

483
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:48,640
machine again they were still pretty big

484
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:49,678
um an entire system would be just one of

485
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:52,799
those racks

486
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:55,840
although they came in

487
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:57,600
smaller configurations a quarter rack or

488
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:59,520
a half rack worth of equipment

489
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:01,520
it was much cheaper too it was one-tenth

490
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:04,000
the price

491
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,799
and the bell lab guys chose well because

492
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,679
over the next

493
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:08,400
20 years or so digital released 30

494
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:10,160
different models

495
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:12,320
so these were everywhere in every niche

496
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:15,120
and unix could run on them

497
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:17,039
which was an important uh key to its

498
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:20,239
success

499
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:23,760
so the first edition of unix um ran on

500
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:25,840
the pdp 1120 this is the front panel

501
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:27,200
for those of you who don't know the

502
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:29,760
front panel you would

503
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:31,360
to boot the machine you would set the

504
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:33,840
switches to an address and hit

505
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:35,678
a button and then data and hit a button

506
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:37,760
and do that a bunch of times and

507
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:39,440
clock in the boot loader and then you'd

508
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,960
hit go and it would run this bootloader

509
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,360
and then if it would crash you could use

510
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,200
it

511
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:45,120
to examine memory to see what was going

512
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:47,840
on it was kind of a

513
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:49,520
crazy way to run things fortunately the

514
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:52,559
boot programs usually were only three or

515
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:56,000
four instructions long

516
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:57,440
but it was kind of crazy we have from

517
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,120
this edition we have the

518
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:03,200
scanned manuals which i included there

519
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:04,799
and it was a straight transliteration of

520
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:07,679
the pdp-7

521
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:11,840
code to pdp-11 code they did nothing

522
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:14,559
else with it

523
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:15,760
at the time at bell labs they weren't

524
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:18,639
worried about creating

525
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:19,760
releases they had the first edition

526
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,360
because that's when they printed the

527
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,080
manual it's the first edition of the

528
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,678
manual

529
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:26,639
and we printed it on a particular day

530
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:28,720
and uh we printed a lot of copies

531
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,799
um but they had kind of a rolling

532
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,000
release for software oh you want unix

533
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:34,320
okay here let me

534
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,360
copy a disk for you here you go was

535
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:37,678
their release model

536
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:38,719
so we don't have a lot of the artifacts

537
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:42,160
from this time

538
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:44,640
that we would like to to run

539
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:46,240
one of the additional uh quirks is there

540
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,600
are a few tapes from this time

541
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:51,039
and they have time stamps on them but we

542
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:52,639
don't know when they're from because

543
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:54,400
instead of being a count of second since

544
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:57,440
1970 it was a count

545
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:59,200
of 1 60th of a second from 1970

546
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:01,039
and that number would roll once a year

547
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,600
or so so though every year they would

548
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:03,679
bump

549
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:05,039
the epic so you would get a tape but you

550
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:06,480
wouldn't know exactly

551
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:08,480
what the epic for the tape was to

552
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,640
interpret the

553
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:11,600
dates on it so a lot of the

554
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:14,080
reconstructed

555
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:16,080
hey here's the first edition unix maybe

556
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:19,120
it is and maybe it isn't probably not

557
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:20,480
because um you know because of this

558
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:23,840
issue

559
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:26,080
now they were able

560
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:27,439
from a course that was taught at bell

561
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:29,840
labs

562
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,840
to

563
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:37,679
reconstruct the assembler for this

564
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:39,039
first edition kernel it was basically

565
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:42,480
listings like this

566
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:43,760
um i've included set uid um just to give

567
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,799
you kind of a flavor of how it was

568
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:48,720
programmed

569
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:52,320
i had an earlier on the pdp 7 slide

570
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:54,080
i had the pdp 7 version of that

571
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,600
and along with this source code listing

572
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:58,240
there's these handwritten notes that

573
00:20:55,600 --> 00:21:00,158
describe every single

574
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:01,440
function in the kernel so that you can

575
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:04,400
go and read them

576
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:05,360
and those are all down at this url here

577
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:08,799
again

578
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:12,799
another twos artifact that's preserved

579
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:16,240
the second edition um was for the pdp

580
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:18,799
1120 and a new 1145 it has a bigger

581
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:22,240
number so it's a bigger machine

582
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:24,240
and in this edition and for the next few

583
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:25,840
they called out how many installations

584
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:27,440
there were they're now 10 unix

585
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,158
installations they were bragging about

586
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,679
it

587
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:32,720
and they're also bragging about moving

588
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:32,720
it to a better machine

589
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:41,760
so in this edition is the start of the c

590
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:43,439
compiler we have a c compiler from here

591
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:46,000
um but we don't have much else there's a

592
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:48,640
few programs from a tape

593
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,880
but that's about it apart from the

594
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:52,640
manuals

595
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,000
again due to the reason i was talking

596
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:57,039
about

597
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,880
by the third edition there

598
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:01,440
up to 16 installations and they're

599
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:04,000
actively running away from the 1120.

600
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,960
why is that well the 1120 was a dinky

601
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,159
little machine

602
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:09,840
that offered no memory protection so um

603
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:11,360
if two people were running on it one

604
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:13,840
person could crash the other person's

605
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,840
code

606
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:18,880
and they wanted to get away from that

607
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:20,399
and the 1145 also

608
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,679
addressed more memory so you could get

609
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:24,559
have a bigger address space so the

610
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:27,440
programs could be bigger

611
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:29,200
and from this edition you know there's

612
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:32,400
no binary snapshots

613
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:34,400
we have a couple um things that might be

614
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,760
from this it might be later

615
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:39,760
and we have a c compiler that's

616
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:43,200
definitely from this time frame

617
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:44,960
so now we're up to november 73

618
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,799
all of this that i've talked about has

619
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,679
happened in a period of less than two

620
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:51,200
years

621
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:52,559
uh the port to the 11 uh 45 is complete

622
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:56,000
they've added another member in the

623
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:58,480
family and they're now up to 20

624
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,080
installations and this is the first

625
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:02,799
edition that they

626
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:03,439
rewrote and see and they want you to

627
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:05,520
know hey

628
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:07,039
this is in c all those other things

629
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:08,639
we're running away from because we don't

630
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:11,919
want to deal with them anymore

631
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:16,960
um but so this marks the

632
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:19,360
fourth version of um of unix

633
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:22,559
and it's also the last rewrite that

634
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:22,559
they'll do for a long time

635
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:28,799
this version also is notable because

636
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:32,159
it's the key version

637
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:35,039
that was adopted inside of bell labs or

638
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:36,720
the bell system we don't have very many

639
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:38,000
artifacts from it which is unfortunate

640
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,840
we can't go and study it

641
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,039
to see who gave what to you know who

642
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:44,399
passed what code to who

643
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:47,520
and when but

644
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:49,600
we know that a lot of early groups grab

645
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:51,360
unix starting with this version

646
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:54,399
this is also the first version to be

647
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:57,520
released to universities

648
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:58,720
four or five got it columbia was the

649
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:02,240
first

650
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:06,320
berkeley mit purdue and

651
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:08,000
harvard um and since

652
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:09,600
it was out in the wild people wanted to

653
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,440
talk about it so usenix

654
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:14,320
forms the unique users group started

655
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:14,320
forming at this time

656
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:18,000
i just tossed up what set uid became a

657
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:19,679
little bit simpler

658
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,679
than the assembler probably something

659
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:23,840
more approachable and it would remain

660
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:26,960
like this all the way through the

661
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:26,959
end of research unix

662
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,959
so what got people interested in unix

663
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:34,158
outside of bell labs well

664
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:37,600
ken and dennis gave a talk

665
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:39,039
at acm computer symposium and they left

666
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:42,000
this teaser in the

667
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:43,760
proceedings just this abstract of what

668
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,200
it could do

669
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:47,840
people the world had to wait till the

670
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:50,559
next summer to

671
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:52,720
discover that all the details that they

672
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:55,440
had talked about in their talk

673
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:57,919
so this is the first paper on unix and

674
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:59,440
after this time if you do a

675
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:01,279
search the number of papers just

676
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:04,320
explodes

677
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:06,720
and this paper is written in t

678
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:09,200
roth so it's typeset so when they sent

679
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:12,000
it off to the communications the acm

680
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:13,039
for publication they said oh i'm sorry

681
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,080
we don't publish things that have

682
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:15,200
already been published before

683
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:17,918
and they said oh no no it hasn't been

684
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:19,360
published this typesetter is part of the

685
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:23,360
system that we describe

686
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:26,559
so please publish it

687
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:26,559
and this would serve as the

688
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:31,520
basis for the documentation for unix for

689
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:34,720
anybody that wanted to use it

690
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:38,158
um for the next four or five years uh

691
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:39,840
if you study this you'll see that

692
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:43,200
correspondence to the paper that i

693
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:45,678
showed before

694
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,720
and another interesting thing starts

695
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:47,919
happening

696
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:50,240
when i was doing the search i found a

697
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:51,120
lot of papers on physical things or

698
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,960
chemical things

699
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:54,399
that were written in bell labs and the

700
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:55,919
only reason they popped up on my search

701
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:58,640
is the last line of the paper said this

702
00:25:55,919 --> 00:26:00,720
paper was typeset on a unix system

703
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:02,559
so it was a way that they would kind of

704
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:04,159
stealth market

705
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:06,480
to everybody that hey this is a cool

706
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:06,480
system

707
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:12,240
um so

708
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:14,000
a lot of people when they think hey when

709
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:16,159
was unix fork they think oh it's the

710
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:20,640
great berkeley system five split

711
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:23,039
that happened in the early 80s well um

712
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:24,240
that's not entirely true off of this

713
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:26,240
fourth edition

714
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:27,679
give or take a little bit four groups

715
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:31,200
inside of bell labs

716
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:34,799
um we're using unix uh the first three

717
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:38,000
i'll describe in a little bit uh

718
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:41,279
but the the last one

719
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,080
was the first use of unix outside of

720
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:43,679
bell labs

721
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:47,840
and it happened with the first edition

722
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:47,840
or so version of unix

723
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:56,720
that uh

724
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:56,720
is cb unix

725
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:00,799
so we've got a very complicated family

726
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:01,840
tree to start with the first one was cb

727
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:05,039
unix

728
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:07,199
it started out as sccs unix and

729
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:08,320
sccs means something different than what

730
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:11,679
most of you are thinking

731
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:14,000
it's um switch control center system

732
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:16,159
i got it right uh rather than source

733
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:19,440
code control system

734
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:21,840
and what this was is an attempt

735
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:23,120
by bell labs to make money off of unix

736
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:25,678
by automating

737
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:26,719
their switching um since they were a

738
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:29,919
phone company

739
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:31,120
they would make a difference they would

740
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:35,360
make their money

741
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:37,279
by having

742
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:39,439
by charging people for long distance and

743
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:41,760
the switch control systems

744
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:42,720
would do that and in order to build

745
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:45,919
these systems

746
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:47,200
uh they added a lot of cool features

747
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:49,520
that weren't in the base research

748
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:52,960
version like

749
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:54,960
inter-process communication and so forth

750
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:56,799
i have a timeline here of all the

751
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:59,120
different things that they added

752
00:27:56,799 --> 00:28:00,399
the important thing to note is they had

753
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:04,479
all this early

754
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:06,719
develop in cb unix or columbus unix

755
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:10,480
but it wasn't really merged back into

756
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:10,480
the main line until system five

757
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:14,879
so when people talk about system five

758
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:17,840
ipc it had its origins

759
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,840
way back here

760
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,559
and

761
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:24,559
one of the things that's kind of

762
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:26,320
unfortunate is this was deployed at

763
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:28,480
hundreds of locations inside

764
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:30,158
of the bell system but it was virtually

765
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:32,480
unknown outside of bell labs

766
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:33,919
we only have one scanned manual and a

767
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:37,120
few interviews to tell us

768
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:39,360
what was going on and

769
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:41,360
in a lot of the books about system five

770
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:42,240
ipc you'll see the name mentioned in

771
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:44,479
maybe

772
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:45,279
one sentence describing what it was used

773
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:47,520
for

774
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:49,440
uh so it's very hard to study this even

775
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:50,559
though we have the manuals and a kernel

776
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:52,880
source listing

777
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:56,080
nobody's gone through and typed it all

778
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:56,080
in and tried to make it work

779
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:03,120
um virtualization is really cool

780
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:04,640
and a lot of people here probably if i

781
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:06,000
ask for a show of hands everybody would

782
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:08,640
raise their hand

783
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,840
for who's using linux or something else

784
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:14,080
in a virtual environment

785
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:15,840
but um ibm actually invented

786
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:18,240
virtualization in the 60s

787
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:19,918
so the first ports of unix to use that

788
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:23,200
were to ibm's vm

789
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:23,200
370 hypervisor

790
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:30,559
but the oldest one is something called

791
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:32,640
mert

792
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:34,559
which is stands for multiple real-time

793
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:38,159
executive

794
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:40,399
one of the groups at bell labs had this

795
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:42,399
that could run real-time processes make

796
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:46,799
real-time guarantees

797
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:49,918
and they ported unix to it to run as a

798
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:50,799
process underneath it with a process

799
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:53,840
with privilege

800
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:55,520
but still a process so if unix crashed

801
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:56,799
to restart it they would just restart

802
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:59,679
the process

803
00:29:56,799 --> 00:30:00,320
and this was a real-time system used

804
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:01,679
also

805
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:04,799
in telephone billing and telephone

806
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:04,799
switching applications

807
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:10,080
it also had an interesting life it was

808
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:11,678
rebranded as unix rt

809
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:13,520
and they tried to sell it for a while

810
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:16,559
and then they abandoned it

811
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:18,158
and then uh dmert which was a

812
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:20,720
multi-processor version

813
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:22,720
um came along so if one processor died

814
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,520
it could restart could be restarted by

815
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:26,080
the other one

816
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:26,639
so they rebranded this unix rtr real

817
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:30,799
time

818
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:32,080
reliable so that everything was reliable

819
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:34,158
and there are a couple of papers on this

820
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,720
i've included if you want to go take a

821
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:36,399
look

822
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:38,240
the next is programmer's workbench now

823
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:40,639
this was one of the releases

824
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:42,559
that made it outside of bell labs and

825
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:44,640
what they did is they took unix

826
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:48,399
and they said hey how can we make the

827
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:48,399
system great for programmers

828
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:51,679
so they did it in a couple ways one they

829
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:53,360
hooked it up to a bunch of mainframes

830
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:56,320
and you could submit your jobs

831
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:57,678
um to the mainframes um at the time you

832
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,480
would have to take these big decks of

833
00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:01,600
cards

834
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:03,120
and walk them across to um an operator

835
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:06,158
who would load them up and

836
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:08,879
run and that was kind of a pain so

837
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:10,960
they made it so that you could just uh

838
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:12,640
submit your jobs remotely

839
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,919
and to do that effectively you need a

840
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:15,679
source code control system so you can

841
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:18,880
make your changes try it out

842
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:21,919
much like we do today with git

843
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:24,720
and this was the first version to

844
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:26,799
have a version of shell it's not the

845
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:30,240
bourne show we have today or bash

846
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:32,399
it's descendant but it's um it's similar

847
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:34,159
and they have a bunch of other

848
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:39,360
productivity tools that went along that

849
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:39,360
awk and grep and said came from this

850
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:43,519
and then unix support group

851
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:51,760
so the unit support group also had

852
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:53,279
um a number of versions of unix that

853
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:55,360
they produced

854
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:57,279
this is the internal line of unix that

855
00:31:55,360 --> 00:32:01,120
would go on to be commercialized a

856
00:31:57,279 --> 00:32:04,720
system three and system five

857
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:09,199
so backing up the first version we have

858
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:10,880
a artifacts for is the fifth edition

859
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:12,799
this was released seven months after the

860
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:16,080
seventh edition

861
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:18,480
and there's now 50 installations

862
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:20,720
um it's still exclusively pdp-11 it's

863
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:22,000
more nc than an assembler but it's still

864
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:24,240
a mix

865
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,080
and we have you can go download from

866
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:27,919
twos images and run them in the

867
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:30,320
simulator

868
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:32,080
and this is the first version that was

869
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:34,720
kind of widely spread among different

870
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,720
universities

871
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:40,840
multi-processing has also been a thing

872
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:43,918
for a long time in unix

873
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:44,879
um but most people don't realize how far

874
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:46,480
back it goes

875
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,919
it goes all the way back to the earliest

876
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:49,360
days if you

877
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:51,039
pulled most people they might say well

878
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:54,080
maybe it was something with a vax

879
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:55,840
and that was the second earliest one

880
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:57,519
a group at purdue took two vaxes and

881
00:32:55,840 --> 00:33:00,639
hooked them together and had an

882
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:01,360
asymmetric multi-processing system that

883
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:03,440
way

884
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:04,479
but the earliest one is something called

885
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:07,519
munich's

886
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:09,440
that was developed at the naval

887
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:11,120
postgraduate school i've included a

888
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:12,640
diagram here with little arrows to show

889
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:14,239
where the cpus are

890
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:15,760
i'm not going to talk about this too

891
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:18,880
much for a couple of reasons

892
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:21,519
one the biggest one is that

893
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:23,120
all we have is the paper and the paper

894
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:24,000
is exactly what you'd expect from a

895
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:26,479
multi-processing

896
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,679
unix paper you have to use semaphores to

897
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:31,279
control

898
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:31,279
simultaneous access and

899
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:36,880
it talks about some of the problems that

900
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:38,960
the unix's of the time had

901
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:40,399
they had a bunch of global variables and

902
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:42,000
that presents some problems if you've

903
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:44,879
got multiple machines trying to access

904
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,880
them at the same time

905
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:48,799
networking in unix also goes back a long

906
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:50,000
ways a lot of people say oh it started

907
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:51,918
with berkeley

908
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,600
and it turns out that there were a

909
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:57,120
number of implementations before

910
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:59,199
berkeley uh did their stack uh

911
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:00,239
before berkeley at at t there was

912
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,279
something called data kit

913
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:04,480
and at berkeley there was something

914
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:07,600
called burknet but

915
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:08,000
bbn wrote the tcpip stack that would

916
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:10,799
actually

917
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,918
later go into berkeley um berkeley added

918
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,839
a sockets api

919
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:15,679
the bbn stack had a completely different

920
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:17,599
api that

921
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:19,200
was more file oriented and showed some

922
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:22,960
of the limitations of the

923
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:22,960
everything is a file paradigm

924
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:27,919
but the earliest ones are it's kind of a

925
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:29,919
tie there's something called network

926
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:34,078
unix that the university of illinois did

927
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:36,158
in 74. and the there's a spider cell

928
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:38,320
network inside of at t and i put both of

929
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:40,159
these up there because it shows

930
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:42,480
the split in thinking between these two

931
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:44,560
groups everybody inside of a t

932
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,679
was circuit switched they're a phone

933
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:47,679
company they make

934
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:49,119
circuit connections so their networking

935
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:51,119
was based on that

936
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:52,720
everybody outside of at t was packet

937
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:53,839
switched everything's virtual we just

938
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:55,520
sent packets

939
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:56,879
and that's the school of thought that

940
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:58,560
won and

941
00:34:56,879 --> 00:35:00,880
that also explains why if you go back

942
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:02,799
and look at these early unix's

943
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:04,960
a lot of the ones from bell labs don't

944
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:07,440
have any tcp stack

945
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:09,680
because they had this giant blind spot

946
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:12,480
they thought everything was going to be

947
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:12,480
circuit switched

948
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:17,839
the sixth edition everything goes viral

949
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:20,320
they have so many installations

950
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:22,240
that they don't call out how many there

951
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:24,720
are

952
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:25,439
and this version if you had a pdp-11 on

953
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,799
the internet

954
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:29,200
it was probably running the sixth

955
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:29,200
edition

956
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:32,720
and you know there's a whole laundry

957
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:35,920
list of new things that

958
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:35,919
um are in this edition

959
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,440
the interesting uh thing is this is

960
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:40,720
where the first commercial license

961
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:43,599
happened up until this had been

962
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:46,959
educational licenses

963
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:49,200
uh and the first commentary on the

964
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:52,720
eunuch system the john lyons book

965
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:54,720
uh was created uh john lyons had

966
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:56,000
a computer class he taught that taught

967
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:58,640
all the internals of version

968
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:00,160
six and so they have a little disclaimer

969
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:01,118
this document may contain information

970
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:03,440
covered by one or more

971
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:04,640
licenses blah blah blah but it's yours

972
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:07,040
the first

973
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:08,160
indication that there's um licensing

974
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:11,359
issues

975
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:13,598
um with unix and so

976
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:14,480
he printed this he did a run of books um

977
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:16,640
after atnt

978
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:18,160
gave permission and then any t withdrew

979
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:19,279
permission so it was impossible to get

980
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:20,879
this book

981
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:23,119
so it became probably the most

982
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:25,599
photocopied book

983
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:26,960
in computer science people would

984
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:28,880
photocopy it and they would

985
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:30,480
if you know there's seventh eighth ninth

986
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:33,359
generation photocopies

987
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:35,440
you know people would pass it around and

988
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:37,440
say hey

989
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:39,520
um you know don't tell anybody but here

990
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:42,640
it is

991
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:44,320
um i'm actually running a little short

992
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:47,200
on time so

993
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:48,800
i'll just mention that the first

994
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:51,040
distribution the first distro

995
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:52,960
wasn't a linux thing it was a group of

996
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:54,560
australian universities with the

997
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:56,240
sixth edition and they made a bunch of

998
00:36:54,560 --> 00:37:00,000
cool enhancements

999
00:36:56,240 --> 00:37:01,598
um to the system to

1000
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,040
make it run in a university environment

1001
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:05,520
where you have hundreds of users

1002
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:06,320
not all of them are trustworthy or

1003
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,599
competent

1004
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:10,400
and you wanna still have your system

1005
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:10,400
survive them

1006
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:18,079
we have a more complicated family tree

1007
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:18,078
that i'm just going to pop up here

1008
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:24,800
and i think i'm going to end on

1009
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:26,960
the ports of unix now a lot of people go

1010
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:28,000
okay it was the intersale 730 was the

1011
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:29,680
first one at the university of

1012
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,280
wollongong and that's correct

1013
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:32,879
but there were two others that happened

1014
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:35,040
within a couple of months

1015
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:36,800
of this bell labs had their own port

1016
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:40,079
there was a few months later

1017
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:42,720
and princeton had a port to vm 370

1018
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:43,920
that was in between those two ports so

1019
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:47,759
within a span

1020
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:50,960
of um a season three four months

1021
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:53,119
unix grew three additional ports

1022
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:55,680
just as a testament to how portable the

1023
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:55,680
system is

1024
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:02,880
so the next thing is bell system

1025
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:04,799
technical journal

1026
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:06,640
i've included a link here for people

1027
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:11,680
that want to read it this was the

1028
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:11,680
documentation people had of unix

1029
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,839
until system 5 came out and the manuals

1030
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:19,839
for that became more

1031
00:38:16,839 --> 00:38:19,839
widespread

1032
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:23,200
and i

1033
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:26,560
i guess i'm going to just end that you

1034
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:28,400
know with the seventh edition unix

1035
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:31,200
explodes it's ported everywhere

1036
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:32,160
everybody's running it everybody's

1037
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:36,799
selling it

1038
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:36,799
it's a very complicated system and

1039
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:41,200
it had a bunch of new features

1040
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:46,480
so this is also the first edition that

1041
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:50,960
has fan art

1042
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:50,960
this is a copy of a t-shirt from usenix

1043
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:56,960
and i think 1980 and not to be outdone

1044
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:58,560
the marketing guys at dex said oh

1045
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:00,480
we'll take that sloppy drawing and make

1046
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:02,078
a nice cool drawing and try to sell our

1047
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:03,680
product

1048
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:05,599
this poster actually is hanging in my

1049
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:06,560
office i couldn't find a copy of it

1050
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:09,359
online so i had to

1051
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:10,078
photograph it so it looks a little wonky

1052
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:12,400
um

1053
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:14,079
and finally if you read my interview i

1054
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:15,760
said i also fixed dinosaurs

1055
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:17,520
this is the four and after picture of a

1056
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:18,240
dinosaur somebody mailed us and it got

1057
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:21,359
broken

1058
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:29,009
i thought people might be curious

1059
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:38,149
so that's my talk questions

1060
00:39:29,010 --> 00:39:38,149
[Applause]

1061
00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:42,960
please wave to me if you want to have a

1062
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:45,599
microphone to

1063
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:45,599
have a question

1064
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:59,200
okay i see your hand

1065
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:00,960
thank you for a great presentation um

1066
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:01,439
why do you think it is that in recent

1067
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,640
years

1068
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:04,160
all these things have been discovered

1069
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:09,040
and why nobody bothered when all the

1070
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:11,839
guys that did the stuff were still alive

1071
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,839
um

1072
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:16,879
i had trouble hearing that question um

1073
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:24,000
um could you repeat the question i guess

1074
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:32,800
why do you think it is that nobody

1075
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:33,839
bothered to ask the guys who did all

1076
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:37,520
this stuff

1077
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:41,359
when they were still alive oh

1078
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:42,079
okay so actually a lot of people have

1079
00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:46,400
asked

1080
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:49,359
um the guys that did the stuff um

1081
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:51,119
several of my slides um i sent email to

1082
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:51,680
ken thompson who happens to still be

1083
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:53,680
alive

1084
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:55,279
and he was very happy to answer my

1085
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:59,118
questions um

1086
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:59,119
other people like dennis ritchie

1087
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:05,839
were active in the two's mailing list

1088
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:07,200
while they were still alive and a number

1089
00:41:05,839 --> 00:41:08,640
of people have done retrospective

1090
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:10,399
interviews

1091
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:12,078
the problem is a lot of the earliest

1092
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:14,400
stuff just didn't get preserved

1093
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:15,920
at all because of the frenetic pace that

1094
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:19,040
they were doing releases

1095
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:20,079
and the best practices at the time

1096
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:23,759
didn't say archive

1097
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:25,280
everything so

1098
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:26,960
there's a question there would you

1099
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:29,839
please stay seated

1100
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:31,920
as long as we have q and a here would be

1101
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:35,839
nice to the people having questions and

1102
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:35,839
understanding the answers

1103
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:41,040
i just noticed this quick note on one of

1104
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:44,160
the slides

1105
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:46,480
about this debugging session

1106
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:48,078
for driving to sydney what's the story

1107
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:51,040
behind that

1108
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:53,040
um repeat the last bit the background

1109
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:56,240
noise is hard for me to hear i'm sorry

1110
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:58,800
so what's the story behind the

1111
00:41:56,240 --> 00:42:00,839
debugging session for which there to

1112
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:03,440
drive to sydney

1113
00:42:00,839 --> 00:42:03,920
yes yeah i was running a little short on

1114
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:06,960
time

1115
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:10,000
but when they first ported um

1116
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:12,160
when dr miller ported uh unix to the

1117
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:15,440
intercell he didn't have a c compiler

1118
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:18,480
for it so he had to

1119
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:21,280
uh basically go through

1120
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:22,480
the pdp-11 compiler and make all the

1121
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:25,760
changes that he needed

1122
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:26,640
to generate intersil opcodes and so he

1123
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:28,560
did that

1124
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:29,920
and then he drove he was in the

1125
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:32,240
university of wollongong which was on

1126
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:34,880
the coast he had to drive to sydney

1127
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:36,479
with a tape and then he would spend you

1128
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:38,720
know a long day debugging

1129
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:40,400
getting the output he would take the

1130
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:44,000
assembler output back

1131
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:47,200
to wollongong and try it out and fix

1132
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:49,359
his source and you know fix both copies

1133
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:50,319
and he had to do that two or three times

1134
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:53,598
before he had

1135
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:56,400
completely bootstrapped the c compiler

1136
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:57,040
and um once he bootstrapped the c

1137
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:59,599
compiler

1138
00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:01,040
he had a lot more time he he writes to

1139
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:03,280
work on the unix system because he

1140
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:07,279
wasn't driving back and forth to sydney

1141
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:08,800
so so that's the story behind that

1142
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:11,280
i could have made this talk like two

1143
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:16,400
hours easily

1144
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:16,400
so are there any other questions

1145
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:27,839
all right do we have some more questions

1146
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:27,839
anyone

1147
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:34,480
i don't think i think so so thank you

1148
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:41,839
very much

1149
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:41,839
maybe thank you all thank you thank you

1150
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:51,599
you
