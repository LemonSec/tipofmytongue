1
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:09,120
okay

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:10,879
um welcome to lightning talks the next

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:13,280
presentation will be by our wrestlers

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:16,160
yes 15 minutes have fun

5
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,960
thank you very much good afternoon i'm

6
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,880
very happy

7
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,240
today because it's my first time at

8
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:23,279
fosdem so

9
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:25,359
let me introduce myself myself a bit my

10
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:25,759
name is orestes mass i'm a professor at

11
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,760
the

12
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,359
university volcanic university of

13
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,760
catalonia where i teach

14
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:33,120
mainly circuits linear circuits and

15
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:36,640
systems

16
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:39,680
and i have a problem the problem is

17
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:42,079
i need to draw circuits lots of them to

18
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:45,360
be included in all sorts of

19
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:47,520
documents exams articles

20
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,480
and so on mix it with other kind of

21
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,120
graphics

22
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,480
with function plots also and with

23
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:56,640
mathematical formulas

24
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:58,480
and and symbols so you get the idea so

25
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,120
but these circuits cannot be drawn in a

26
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:03,760
in a in whatever way

27
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:05,119
uh instead have to fulfill certain

28
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:08,880
restrictions

29
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:10,880
which are more or less these ones

30
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:13,920
first of all they have to be beautiful

31
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:15,920
and of publishing quality

32
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,159
we need a large library of predefined

33
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,520
symbols to avoid reinventing the wheel

34
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:22,720
over and over

35
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,520
and it's better to not mix libraries

36
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,560
from different

37
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:29,759
different authors because you

38
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:33,360
will end up with a mess of of styles

39
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:34,159
uh we also it need to change the the

40
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,759
appearance of

41
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:40,000
of symbols upon needs

42
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:41,439
and a thing i consider very important is

43
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,840
a consistent

44
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:45,199
typography between the text and the

45
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,240
graphics now for instance

46
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,920
here you have a circuit uh where you

47
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:53,360
have some symbols over there

48
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:56,079
variables currents voltages and

49
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,399
often your reference makes a reference

50
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:59,600
of

51
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:03,600
uh to these symbols in the text and

52
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:07,039
if you look at the symbols they have a

53
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:09,598
font and if you later

54
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,479
change your mind mind and want to change

55
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:13,119
the font

56
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:13,840
the the graphic has to change the font

57
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,920
too

58
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,680
for instance here you have other kind of

59
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:21,280
symbols and the graphic is

60
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:22,000
updated accordingly and finally we want

61
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,800
to create

62
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,680
and edit this these graphics this

63
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,239
circuits

64
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,040
using free tools over on free systems

65
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:32,400
and

66
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:34,560
and saving it in three formats so

67
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,480
obviously there are many software

68
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:39,440
packages out there

69
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:41,040
to those circuits but if you apply those

70
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:45,040
restrictions the the list

71
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:49,120
starts to shrink so

72
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:52,160
we ended by choosing

73
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:54,400
first of all later to

74
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,519
write the document in latex for the grid

75
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,480
quality

76
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:59,920
it provides and second describe the

77
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:03,440
diagrams

78
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:05,200
textually in in pixel which is a subset

79
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:08,560
of an extension of the lattice

80
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:09,359
language so which with this method we

81
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,519
achieve

82
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,560
perfect integration within between text

83
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:15,920
and graphics

84
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:17,760
we gain programmability and flexibility

85
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:20,799
maths are no problem because you have

86
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:24,159
all the latex power to typeset math

87
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:27,280
uh also take the zeta have

88
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:30,079
has a group the library to typeset

89
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,599
circuit elements which is called circuit

90
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:34,799
pixel

91
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:36,480
and we end up with vector graphics that

92
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:39,200
you can

93
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,840
enlarge and shrink without loss of

94
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,119
quality

95
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:45,680
here you have an example in few lines

96
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,680
you can describe a graphic which is

97
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:51,440
useless in this case obviously

98
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:54,080
but uh you more or less see the

99
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:55,840
the the power of the of the solution

100
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:58,959
okay

101
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:00,000
uh well uh did that is that the end of

102
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:03,519
the story not not

103
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,239
at all because the circuit exeter uh

104
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:06,879
is a good choice but for us half has

105
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,000
some

106
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:14,640
minor issues uh aesthetical ones

107
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:16,959
and and also practical one no

108
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,918
when you write a circuit in texas you

109
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:20,519
end up

110
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:22,000
in circuit exeter you end up um

111
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:24,960
[Music]

112
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,080
specifying absolute coordinates all the

113
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:30,159
time and this is

114
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:34,080
not it's very not very good also if you

115
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:36,880
if you look uh at the graphic of of the

116
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:38,960
on the on the right you see that these

117
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,880
holographic it's more consistent with

118
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:44,479
the line width is more consistent

119
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:47,680
the the elements are better

120
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:50,000
proportionate you know and

121
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,919
the syntax here you don't have the you

122
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,720
don't have the syntax but it's clear

123
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:57,599
in some ways no so we decided use a

124
00:04:54,720 --> 00:05:01,600
thing called silk with macros

125
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:05,039
which i described a bit later so what is

126
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:07,120
what's by circuit by circuit

127
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:08,479
obviously when you describe a circuit

128
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:12,000
textually you need some

129
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:16,159
some sort of visual feedback and

130
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,160
passive grid is an application that

131
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:21,679
has in the doors in the in the

132
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:24,800
background some compilation steps

133
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,240
and presents the result to you in a

134
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,639
visual form

135
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,600
is an application written in python in

136
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:33,600
python 3 i'm

137
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:35,280
using pyqt 5 so it works in windows

138
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:38,000
linux and mac

139
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,799
it's multi-platform and has two modes of

140
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,759
operation

141
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,160
here is the the graphical user interface

142
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,280
mode

143
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:49,199
and also has a command line interface

144
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:49,198
to process files in batch mode

145
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,199
how it works first step is to describe

146
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:58,400
your circuit diagram in a source file

147
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:59,199
uh and in the source file you put the

148
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,000
elements

149
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,479
using a circuit macros which are a set

150
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,520
of

151
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:08,560
macros written by dr apovich

152
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:09,359
of the waterloo university in canada and

153
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,400
then

154
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:15,360
you use the m4 utility the gnu

155
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:17,679
m4 utility to process this source file

156
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,680
and expand the macros into a

157
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,440
pick language speak language and

158
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:24,479
unfortunately is

159
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:25,360
is not understanding directly by by

160
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:29,599
later

161
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:33,360
so you need another step which is

162
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:37,120
done by by the peak utility

163
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:40,400
that it's also written by dr applewich

164
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:45,039
and the utility converts the source

165
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:45,039
in this case the pic source file into a

166
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,719
various languages which some of them are

167
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:51,520
generic

168
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,479
and some of them are latex specific we

169
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,680
choose

170
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:57,919
for our purposes the first one

171
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,440
so here have uh the two steps i

172
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:02,560
mentioned earlier

173
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:06,160
are here depicted in in

174
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:09,520
fosdem violet color no and you end up

175
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,160
with a thick zeta file which uh you can

176
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:13,280
embed

177
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:16,160
this in in in a minimal

178
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:17,359
later document process it to obtain a

179
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,479
pdf file

180
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,479
and then this pdf file

181
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,599
process it again to obtain a raster file

182
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:29,440
pj

183
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:32,639
file in this case to visualize it

184
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:34,800
so uh um as a bonus

185
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:36,000
at the user request we can also generate

186
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:39,360
other formats like

187
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,360
svg uh

188
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:46,400
jpeg etc so

189
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:49,840
this is the wall picture essentially uh

190
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:52,479
now the pi circuit is in deviant testing

191
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:53,280
so uh the end users can instead testing

192
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:54,960
user can

193
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,638
install it uh straight pretty

194
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:59,039
straightforward uh

195
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:59,680
if you don't have debian testing or you

196
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:02,878
have other

197
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:06,080
operating systems you can use uh

198
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:09,599
pipeline of pip ins

199
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:13,039
install to install it in your computer

200
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:14,719
and the sources are on github if you

201
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:17,440
install it by hand you have to install

202
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:21,199
the order the dependencies

203
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:24,240
you can see the readme file to

204
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:27,440
to see so let's do a

205
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:30,240
little demonstration here you have

206
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,800
uh the graphical user interface and you

207
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,719
can

208
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:35,279
start to enter the code here this is a

209
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:37,120
minimal template that the

210
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:39,200
by circuit offers when you when it

211
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:42,479
starts so

212
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:46,080
we can we start with a source with a

213
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:49,360
source in the upper direction

214
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,880
you can parameterize it with

215
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:53,760
various symbols here you have for

216
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:55,839
instance in the documentation you have

217
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,880
all the possibilities for the source

218
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:59,519
element

219
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:01,360
it's very well documented the secrets

220
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:04,399
the circuit

221
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,839
macros so you can change for instance in

222
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:09,839
this case

223
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:09,839
to a square wave

224
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,519
we can apply a label in this case the

225
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:17,920
label is a left

226
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:21,440
label because going up the label

227
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:24,640
is in your left hand no and

228
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:28,000
it accepts three parameters abc that

229
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:31,439
goes in the into the bottom center and

230
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:36,000
upper position

231
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:39,200
so you can change that to the symbols to

232
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:42,720
specify the the voltage

233
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:45,600
and now we are at the top of this source

234
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,800
so we can add other elements here a

235
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:50,080
resistor in the right

236
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:54,240
direction with length l

237
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:57,360
and we call we can add a label two

238
00:09:54,240 --> 00:10:00,720
to the top this time

239
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,279
we add only one one symbol the other are

240
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,800
blank

241
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:07,760
the other two now

242
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:09,839
we are always at the relative position

243
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,640
we are now at the at the right side of

244
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:14,240
the resistance

245
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:17,360
so you don't have to to push this button

246
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,240
every time you can write some comments

247
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:21,200
and

248
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:24,079
see the result later for instance here's

249
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:27,760
a capacitor in the down direction

250
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:30,800
and we add for instance a line

251
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:31,600
line is a command in the pic language

252
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:34,160
you can

253
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,680
mix circuit macros and pick language

254
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:39,120
here

255
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:41,359
and the line goes is down from the

256
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:45,680
bottom of the capacitor if you want to

257
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:48,720
draw it from the top you can add a label

258
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:53,279
and then specify it and this line

259
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:56,240
has to be drawn from this label so

260
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:59,040
then you can complete the circuit close

261
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:02,160
the circuit adding for instance a gap

262
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:05,120
which is down in the down direction from

263
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,120
this last point

264
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:10,399
c label is a label centered so

265
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:16,399
we can add here the output voltage

266
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:17,519
and finally we want to close the circuit

267
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:21,360
drawing a line

268
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:24,480
to the to the start of the of the graph

269
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,519
but uh well we missed here the c the

270
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,560
label from

271
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:30,320
for the capacitor so if you want to

272
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:32,399
specify a line

273
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,560
to the stat we have to define another

274
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:37,680
level label

275
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:41,040
so we go

276
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:44,000
here and we can

277
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:45,439
declare a label here is always the the

278
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,920
the actual position

279
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:53,120
and then we draw a line to start

280
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:56,639
okay so the graphic is of

281
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:59,519
great quality and you can save it

282
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:59,839
and export it with the other button to

283
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:03,680
the

284
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:06,399
uh so the formats you you you want

285
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:07,199
and the format you want you choose in

286
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:11,200
the settings

287
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:14,240
in the settings menu okay

288
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,880
uh also you have all the power of lap of

289
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,839
latter

290
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:19,200
to typeset formulas so here you have a

291
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:22,480
more complicated

292
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:26,000
expression for your series from

293
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,560
for this label and you save and export

294
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,240
it

295
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:34,000
okay this is the the idea uh if you

296
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:37,440
want to to see how the command line

297
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:40,959
works uh so

298
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:45,839
you have here some files

299
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:49,760
and uh we can

300
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:53,680
we can activate the this is a uh

301
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:56,319
i think um that is necessary if you

302
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:57,040
execute the pi circuit in a field and in

303
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,920
a python

304
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,240
inside a python virtual environment so

305
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:03,760
the

306
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:07,360
the command line has all these options

307
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:11,040
you can process files and and

308
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:15,200
write the result in pixel format pdf

309
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:15,199
png injepe svg

310
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:19,440
you can you can specify the resolution

311
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:23,920
of output raster images

312
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:27,040
the quality of lossy formats

313
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,920
destination directory etc so for

314
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:31,680
instance here

315
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:35,760
we specify we call pi circuit

316
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:36,319
and we ask for a pdf format a png format

317
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:40,000
with a

318
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:44,000
dot print resolution of 250

319
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:46,959
and all the circuits uh

320
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,880
ended in ckt if you if this process

321
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:52,079
encounters an error

322
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:54,000
you can choose to abort to skip

323
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:55,599
this file to the word all the wall

324
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,399
process to skip this file

325
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,279
or to open the the graphical user

326
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:01,120
interface

327
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:03,279
to see what's happening so in this case

328
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:08,480
we choose the letter

329
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:08,480
and here's an unknown command i i put it

330
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:16,079
on purpose you can correct the error

331
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:19,519
save it pressing ctrl s or something

332
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:22,719
and the process uh

333
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:25,440
follows okay so it's

334
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:26,240
that's in essential the the the work the

335
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,680
working of

336
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:33,040
of by circuit the future work

337
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:34,319
here you have i don't have much time to

338
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:37,360
explain it but it's uh

339
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:40,639
self-explaining uh

340
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:44,720
and uh well i would like to to finish it

341
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:46,720
uh the talk by um

342
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,720
showing you the relevance the relevant

343
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:52,000
links of the of the project

344
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:55,600
and uh acknowledging the the
